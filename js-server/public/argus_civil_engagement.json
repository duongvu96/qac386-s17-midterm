		"content": "The recent opening of the Inn at Middletown and increasing prestige of Middletown restaurants have added to the town’s status as a culturally flourishing area. Now, Mayor Dominique Thornton has taken another significant step toward this cultural expansion by inviting Goodspeed Operahouse to join the Middletown community. President Bennet immediately stepped forward to support the potential move by attending a meeting with the Goodspeed Board of Trustees and publishing an opinion piece in the Hartford Courant. Bennet’s involvement, which is a clear vote of support for the Middletown community, will strengthen town-gown relations and open Wesleyan’s gates to new theatrical possibilities. The Opera House would become another draw for tourists from around the state and would boost Middletown’s already growing economy. Middletown is on the right track, and Goodspeed would help it stay there.  The Opera House is not only a good idea for Middletown. For students, the center would provide opportunities for many levels of involvement, including possible internships and student discounts on performances at a professional venue. Goodspeed itself would benefit from an available student body and growing cultural community, and the University would reap the rewards of an enriched location. Now that Bennet has made his stand, it is up to him and the rest of the University to follow through. Students can find out more about Goodspeed by visiting www.goodspeed.org, and can send e-mails to the organization to encourage their move to Middletown. As for President Bennet, he should be congratulated for his endorsement and encouraged to stay on track.  Hopefully between Bennet and Mayor Thornton, enough encouragement will be fostered to bring Goodspeed Operahouse to Middletown."

		"title": "Mel Gibson to speak at commencement",
		"date": "2004-04-02",
		"authors": "by Rae Kaplan, Arts Editor",
		"content": "Popular actor and director Mel Gibson, will give the Commencement address this May, the President’s Office announced yesterday. Already, the Administration and student-body alike have expressed reacted ‘passionately.’ Inspired by Gibson’s latest directing endeavor, “The Passion of the Christ,” professors from the Film Department and the Religion Department teamed together to bring Gibson to the University. “With Wesleyan’s constantly growing Film Department, we feel that the strides Mr. Gibson has been making in his career reflect the direction of greatness we only hope our programs here will achieve,” said Jeanine Basinger, Film Chair. Like Wesleyan students, Gibson is not afraid to take risks and stir people up as evidenced by “The Passion.” The months preceding the movie’s release were filled with controversy and protests, favorite pastimes of the University community. “’Passion’ has led to many provocative conversations on campus, in every sect of spirituality. I am very excited by the implications this has for May’s Commencement,” said Rabbi David Leipziger, the University Jewish Chaplain. Students pro and anti-Gibson can’t suppress their anticipation of Gibson’s arrival, though they have their various reasons.  “After seven years here, now when I tell people I went to Wesleyan they can say ‘Oh, the small-liberal arts school in Middletown where Mel Gibson spoke,’ not ‘Huh? The girls’ school?’ This is the big break Wesleyan needs,” said Gibson fan Mike Jones ’04, who will finally be graduating this May, with Gibson as his witness. “I think it’s an outrage to have an anti-Semite address our class, but I’m so thrilled for all the activism this allows for. We’ve already started to plan fliers, t-shirts, rallies, petitions and- off the record- chalking.  It’s gonna be a blast! This is exactly how I want to remember my years at Wesleyan,” said Sara Martin ’04. With his trophy case of awards from the Academy, Blockbuster, MTV, and People’s Choice (to name a few), Gibson’s greatness equals, and possibly even surpasses, the prize-winning hall of fame of Wesleyan Commencement speakers who’ve never won an Oscar, but maybe a Nobel. The University has teamed up with Destinta Movie Theaters to fully capitalize on the event. After the ceremony and Gibson’s address, the new graduates will be able to view a special screening of “The Passion” at Destinta and enjoy a medium popcorn and soda for only three dollars if they present their cap and gown at the door. “It’s obviously great publicity for our theater to have a Hollywood star at a screening of his movie, but I am a little worried about Wesleyan students protesting.  I guess that’s the price of superstardom,” said Tony Andrews, Destinta Manager. Churches from throughout the New England area have already begun organizing pilgrimages to come see Gibson at the University, feeling he is a modern day prophet. Father Louis Manzo, University Catholic Chaplain, also hopes to connect to Jesus through Gibson. “It would be great to have another ceremonial rededication of the renovated Chapel with Gibson presiding with Jesus by his side,” he said. It took a lot of effort for the University to get the busy Gibson to give the Commencement address, but President Doug Bennet pulled through to ensure a memorable ceremony for the graduating class and their families. However, President Bennet couldn’t do it all by himself and credits his loving wife Midge for her relentless support and encouragement- or in other words, nagging- until Gibson was secured. “Mel’s a hunk,” she said. “I would never be able to forgive myself for letting this opportunity slip away.”"

		"title": "Administration to phase out off-campus housing in upcoming years",
		"date": "2004-04-20",
		"authors": "by Eliza Simon, Staff Writer",
		"content": "Although immediate changes seem unlikely, the days of off-campus housing for Wesleyan students are numbered.  For now, the system of granting off-campus status remains the same, according to Assistant Director of Residential Life Rich DeCapua. However, he asserted that changes to the University’s housing options over the next few years will eliminate the need for off-campus housing. Currently, the number of students allotted off-campus status is determined each year by a calculation that takes into account the University’s housing capacity, current enrollment, and projected enrollment for the incoming first-year class. Due to these factors, a record 200 students have been granted permission to live off-campus for the 2004-2005 school year, DeCapua said. Off-campus status is granted by class year. Seniors have first priority in this process, followed by juniors and then sophomores. Students who miss the deadline to apply for off-campus status or who have bad luck in the housing lottery can be placed on a waitlist for off-campus places.  “It’s all a numbers game,” DeCapua said. “The only thing that has changed for next year is the number of [off-campus] spots.” The University grants off-campus status because there are not enough on-campus rooms to accommodate all of Wesleyan’s students. Once the new residential halls are built, however, administrators project that the University will be able to adequately house all of its students. “One of the unique things about Wesleyan is that we have a residential community,” DeCapua said. “The ideal would be to get rid of off-campus housing entirely.” Director of University Communications Justin Harmon explained that minimizing off-campus housing will help to create a more centralized campus as distinct from the neighborhoods that surround it. “We need to better develop [and] define the edges of campus vis-à-vis the residential areas,” he said.  According to Harmon, the new Fauver Field housing, which will replace In-town, will help to achieve this goal. For its purposes, Harmon said that In-town is not a viable neighborhood for students due in part to its location. This decision came about after extensive discussion among administrators, students and neighbors.  “[Once built, the Fauver Field housing] will create a better articulated edge between town and gown,” he said.  Some students expressed concern about the University’s plan to get rid of the off-campus housing option. “Living off-campus is a great way for students to save money, live in a nice place and avoid the stress of the housing lottery,” said Jessica Weidmann ’05, who will live at an  off-campus house in the fall. “It will definitely be cheaper to live off-campus next year, as long as we can find summer sub-letters.”  DeCapua acknowledged that students may choose to live off-campus because of financial concerns, but said that those students were trading savings for responsibility. According to DeCapua, the higher cost of living in University-owned housing is offset by its benefits. “In off-campus housing, you’re really on your own,” DeCapua said. “That’s your game. You have to deal with your landlord and your lease. But on-campus there are amenities: you can put in a work order to get a light bulb fixed, and Public Safety will patrol your area.”  Off-campus fraternities and other student organizations will also need to reconsider their status once off-campus housing ceases being a possibility for students.  “Fraternities, as a practical manner, will have to be a part of program housing if they want to be housing students,” Harmon said. According to DeCapua, the University projects that the two Fauver Field residential halls—one of which will house first-years and the other upperclassmen—will open in time for the 2005-2006 school year. At that point, he said, off-campus housing status will no longer be available for most students. The Office of Residential Life will continue to make exceptions in this policy for students with “special considerations,” such as medical concerns.  “Our main priority is to house students,” said DeCapua, “but any time we can house students on campus, we will.”"

		"date": "2004-09-21",
		"authors": "by ,",
		"content": "Next year, the University will force all students, except in a handful of extraordinary circumstances, to live on-campus. This change represents another step toward the University’s Master Plan, which will require all students to live in a few large, characterless, University-built dorms.  These changes are hurtful to the students and to the University for many reasons and they need to be reconsidered. Currently, students and Middletown residents (Non-University Personnel, in the tactful jargon of the Administration) live in a symbiotic world as neighbors and landlords. This closeness helps foster good relations and the sense that all of us belong to a community larger than Wesleyan. Forcing students to isolate themselves in dorms on-campus is contradictory to the spirit of integration and will only aggravate the deteriorating relations between campus and community. And let’s not discuss the financial devastation local landlords would incur from the removal of all students from their rental properties.  At the same time, living off-campus allows students to save money. The Administration claims that once all students are assigned on-campus housing, it will consider requests from students in dire financial need for off-campus status so that they will not have to pay the annual $6,000 on-campus housing bill. All students should have the right to shop around to save money, not just those on financial aid. They should also have the right to deal directly with landlords about privacy, pets and other issues rather than simply conform to University regulations.  Finally, it is a huge and much-appreciated convenience for upperclassmen to be able to move in and get settled before the official University-designated move-in date. Off-campus housing also allows students to stay in the same residence for multiple years, which forges stronger relationships between classmates and housemates. It has been found that such bonding leads to increases in alumni donating, an aspiration of any University.  We realize that having all students close together keeps our community tight. Still, segregating students from the greater community while integrating them into the ever-expanding reaches of the Administration needs to be avoided for Wesleyan to maintain its reputation as fostering political awareness and community service."

		"title": "For V-Day needs, head to Tina’s",
		"date": "2005-02-11",
		"authors": "by Laura Brown, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "In the need of a Valentine’s gift for someone? Tina’s Fine Lingerie, located on Main Street provides options to fit the occasion. The store includes a wide variety of lingerie, with everything from bras and panties to hosiery and even bustiers. They also offer costumes, novelties, dresses, gowns and an impressive swimwear collection.  According to Tina Lun, the store’s owner, Tina’s Fine Lingerie offers the largest collection of fine and sexy lingerie and the best Venus Swimwear in Connecticut. Lun said that Valentine’s Day and Christmas are the two busiest times for the store. While the vast majority of customers during the year are women, men make up about half of the clientele around Christmas and 75 percent of the clientele around Valentine’s Day. “Right now a lot of people request the heart bustier,” said employee Amanda Matthews, referring to the bustier displayed in the Main Street window. “Basically, anything red sells really well around this time. A lot of people are looking for baby dolls and corsets. Around Valentine’s Day is also when people buy the more naughty gifts.” “Naughty gifts” include a variety of sex toys, lubricants, videos, games and body jewelry. Whips are hot items right now, although surprisingly not the furry love cuffs,  Matthews said.   Tina’s has had good relations with Wesleyan students since it opened, and has employed students in the past. Last year Lun said she would have accepted points at her store had the Wesleyan points system used in Middletown restaurants and businesses been willing to include her store. Business from students is never very big, she said; most customers are over 20, according to Lun. Wesleyan students, however, do make up a niche group of customers.  According to Janene Podesta ’05, the store’s merchandise offers real potential for student business. “Tina is really busy right now,”  Matthews said. “This is always a busy time for us…She just has a lot to do.” “During Halloween, we get a lot of Wesleyan students in here,” Lun said. “With costumes they usually don’t buy the whole outfit, but we sell a lot of fishnet stockings.”   In addition, Lun does much of her own photography for the store’s website, Tinasfinelingerie.com. It features an online catalogue with shipping all across the US along with information on how to host your own lingerie “home party.” Tina’s Fine Lingerie is normally open Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. until 6 p.m., Saturdays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and is closed on Sundays. They will have extended hours this week, staying open until 8 p.m. until   Valentine’s Day."

		"title": "Center for Continuing Studies launches its second semester",
		"date": "2005-02-11",
		"authors": "by Eric Lach, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "The Center for Continuing Studies, which offers non-credit classes in the liberal arts to community members, alumni, and parents of students, held a reception at Broad Street Books Monday night to celebrate its first completed semester. As a result of the success of the five courses the center ran in the fall, it plans to offer five courses for the spring semester. A digital print class, one of these spring classes, had only two spots left after the first day of registration. “The center is a very positive advantage that Middletown residents have because of Wesleyan,” said Middletown Mayor Domenique S. Thornton, at the reception. “It expands horizons, adds depth to people’s lives and understanding, and opens up new interests and careers.”  According to the Mayor, city employees get a reduction in tuition from Wesleyan and a reimbursement from the city as an incentive to take advantage of the center.  Balloons, a catered spread, wine, and a podium adorned what normally is Broad Street’s magazine section for the event, converting the space into a cozy reception area. The crowd of 40 people in attendance was a mix of Wesleyan staff, town officials, and former and future students of the program. “It was nice to see the different people who came,” said Penny Robinar, a Middletown resident who took “History of the Book” last semester. “It didn’t matter who you were or where you were from.”  Most in attendance agreed that the Center for Continuing Studies is a great addition to Middletown and hope that the program will become a permanent fixture in the community.  “Our goal for enrollment last semester was 50, and we ended up having 58 students,” said Dr. Lori Hunter-Union, Associate Dean of Continuing Studies and Director of the Graduate Liberal Studies Program. “This semester the program is looking to expand to 75 students.” Residents who had taken some of the classes offered spoke highly of their courses and professors.  “It was thrilling,” Robinar said. “It gave me a peek at what Wesleyan has to offer. We kept [the professor] late with questions every time. We wanted her to stay.” Although Wesleyan has offered continuing studies courses for credit in the past, with programs like PIMS, upward bound, and the GLSP, the Center for Continuing Studies fills some of the gaps left by the other programs. “[The center] allows for learning just for the fun of it,” Hunter-Union said.  “These courses aren’t as expensive as the for-credit courses given in the past,” said Barbara Arafeh, a Middletown resident who is enrolled for spring classes. “It will help to refresh on the latest findings [in infant development],” Arafeh said. She already has a Masters degree and runs a kindermusik program, but promotes the importance of continuing one’s education.  “This is a great start [for the center], but there is still growing to do,” said Billy Weitzer, Dean of Continuing Studies and Senior Associate Provost. In the future, Weitzer hopes that the center can develop a closer connection with Wesleyan in which films, lectures, and concerts can be cosponsored. According to Weitzer, the goal of the center is to expand and enrich the Wesleyan community. “It’s great that [the center] links town and gown, and that it is unidirectional,” Weitzer said. “Middletown has a lot to teach Wesleyan.”"

		"title": "Wesleyan draws line between High Rise and Traverse Square",
		"date": "2005-09-20",
		"authors": "by Alexandra Early,",
		"content": "This morning I woke up too early, as I do every morning because of the light filtering through the slits between my window shades. I pulled up the shades and admired the view before me. To the left, the elementary school turned condominium on College St. and the immense office building on Court St. The red awning of Broad Street Books and opposite it, the dark maroon, oddly shaped government subsidized elderly home. The clock tower of the Middletown police station, and the scattered spires of various churches and temples. In the distance, the grayish blue bridge which passes into the hills of Portland, and patches of the snaking Connecticut River. And directly below my eighth floor High Rise window, the projects of Traverse Square. Earlier, I heard the shouts of children playing, but when I looked down what caught my eye was a group of men shoveling dirt from a muddy black truck into the newly blocked off staircase that once physically connected Wesleyan students and Middletown’s poor. One of Low Rise’s many staircases, these four steps were blocked off with stark white cement by the time this year’s generation of Low and High Risers moved in. The wall was a disturbingly clear expression of the Administration’s attitude toward the residents of Traverse Square. It told them to stay on their side and us to stay on ours. And now the warning is covered with dirt, soon to be replaced by a flower garden for the benefit of visiting prefrosh and their parents. Now it is as if there never was a staircase on which students could so easily break out of the much-maligned Wesleyan bubble and meet their Traverse Square neighbors. The new protocol is to ignore their existence (but always remember to cross the street when we reach their block, especially if it’s at night!) Because all we know about them is what we read in the Argus or in Public Safety Announcements. They jump us and mug us when we are coming home drunk from a party. Or if we live close by, we hear them some nights hanging out on their stoops. We try to drown out their laughing and shouting with the classical music emanating from our laptops so we can finish our readings about the history of colonialism or the theory of racism. Wesleyan had made some laudable efforts to build a community that integrates town and gown. Some Wesleyan students patronize Middletown stores, volunteer in the North End, teach ESL to Wesleyan employees or play with kids at local after-school programs, like the one at Traverse Square. But what if the University just threw a block party, or a cookout, like normal neighbors do when they want to get to know each other? At the very least, this would show Traverse Square residents that Wesleyan students want to be good neighbors. We could talk to and learn first hand about people who appear to be frighteningly different than us. Next time when we pass after class, we would have a reason to wave or stop and say hello, instead of tensing up, walking faster and looking straight ahead. And maybe this would begin to repair some of the damage done by years of building walls and sending out warnings. Wesleyan University prides itself on creating students who are inquisitive, knowledgeable and conscientious, students who contribute to their communities. But what model do we have to follow? We are instructed to read extensively about the problems of poor people and minorities, and strive in think tanks and nonprofits to fix their problems, asking once in a while for their input. But we should not live near them. We should not talk to them. We should stay on our side of the wall."

		"title": "Mayor greets voters before upcoming election",
		"date": "2005-10-07",
		"authors": "by Matt DiBlasi, News Editor",
		"content": "Mayor Domenique Thornton and Democratic candidates for various councils, commissions and boards talked with the Middletown community Thursday Evening at Luce Restaurant. The meet-and-greet event was organized by Middletown’s Young Democrats and was well attended by voters and local high school students. “It’s inspiring, as a lifelong Democrat, to see the participation of young people,” said Mayor Thornton at the event. “It is only through young voters that our democracy can work. If you don’t participate in the process, you can’t complain about the outcome.” The mayor discussed issues that have been important to her during her tenure as mayor, citing the environmental and economic development that has taken place over the last eight years in Middletown, particularly the increase in retail and dining in the downtown area. “More restaurants [and stores] are interested in coming downtown,” she said. Despite the economic growth, the number one issue for Thornton has always been education. She began her political career by campaigning to support educational funding and has played a key role in moving the new high school building project forward. Improving the relationship between the University and the town has always been an important issue as well. “I promoted projects such as Wesleyan’s Long Lane school acquisition, the Inn, and the Green Street Arts Center,” Thornton said. “I plan to continue a very strong [town-gown] relationship in the future.” However, a non-University educational issue is taking center stage in the upcoming election. “The construction of the new high school is the number one issue,” said Dan Filer ’78, who is running for a seat on the Board of Education. “We have the right site and the right people now and we need to proceed and build it. It’s going to be state-of-the-art.” Thornton, who will oppose Republican candidate Sebastian Giuliano in the Nov. 8 election, was arrested on Sept. 14, but cleared of a DUI charge and a traffic violation Sept. 21 in Middletown Superior Court. Her blood-alcohol content was determined to be .018, well below .08, the legal limit in Connecticut. In addition, a toxicology test on a urine sample showed that there was no medication in her body that could have been dangerous in combination with the glass of red wine she had with dinner on the night of the arrest.  According to police, Thornton failed a field sobriety test after being pulled over, but she explained to several of the voters at the meet and greet that she has a spine curvature in addition to other ailments, including a sprained ankle at the time the test was administered. The overwhelming sentiment of the present members of the Democratic Party was that the mayor, who was followed for three miles before being pulled over, may have been unfairly targeted because of the upcoming election. Last year, Thornton defeated Giuliano by just 232 votes, but she has been working hard to ensure another victory. “I’ve been going door-to-door,” Thornton said. “I started Aug. 8. I’m personally asking voters to come out and vote because every vote counts. I need the support to continue making progress. I hope people realize that it will come to a screeching halt unless we keep the Democrats in office.”"

		"title": "Sutton and Trio play benefit for arts center in Crowell",
		"date": "2005-11-11",
		"authors": "by Emily Einhorn, Assistant Arts Editor",
		"content": "As Tierney Sutton ’86 sang the words “blue skies smiling on me,” sighs could be heard from the audience and smiles seen. Happiness permeated last Friday night’s benefit performance for the Green Street Arts Center (GSAC) by Tierney Sutton and Trio.  An early event of Homecoming weekend, Tierney Sutton’s concert served as a medium to strengthen Wesleyan’s connections to the art center, which was co-founded by the University and Middletown community members last spring. Sutton gave the concert as a gift to the center to raise money and publicity. Sutton strutted onto the stage in a stunning red evening gown, her three band members dressed in black behind her. The show was completely sold out and those without tickets were turned away. A buzz of excitement and energy could be heard throughout the audience as people reconnected with old friends, faculty, and students. An eclectic mix of benefactors, Wesleyan families, students lucky enough to get one of the 25 free student tickets, people associated with the Green Street Arts Center, and lovers of good jazz filled Crowell Concert Hall to the max.  Ricardo Morris, the director of the GSAC, introduced Sutton, described services of the GSAC and thanked Wesleyan and Sutton for their support and generosity. Over fifty students have volunteered time at the GSAC since its opening in January 2005. “Wesleyan students share their gifts, talents, and enthusiasm for life,” Morris said.  Sutton jumped into stunning vocal scales and her band slowly entered in behind her. Sutton’s band has been together for twelve years and has recorded seven CDs. Her band includes Kevin Axt on bass, Ray Brinker on drums, and Christian Jacob on piano. The group played many songs from their new live album and some old favorites. One crowd pleaser was an arrangement on an old Irvin Berlin song that Sutton promised would take the audience “on a band adventure ride.”  Sutton constantly mentioned how talented her band members are and showcased them often during the songs. The last song of her first set, a rearrangement of “Ding, Dong, the Witch is Dead” highlighted all three of her band members while leaving room for acrobatic vocals. Sutton sang quickly, clearly, and beautifully through the quick dramatic changes in speed and intensity throughout the song. Throughout the night Sutton spoke of her time at Wesleyan, which she credits with her decision to become a jazz singer—a decision catalyzed when she saw jazz great Betty Carter sing on Crowell’s stage. She also described teachers who inspired and aided her love and appreciation of music. “By the time I graduated from Wesleyan with a degree in Russian literature I knew I wanted to be a jazz singer,” Sutton said, drawing laughs. Sutton then sang “The Girl from Ipanema” in Russian.  “This is the most expensive eight bars in music history,” she said. “When my father is in the audience he weeps.” The second set of the night, which included songs by Cole Porter, Johnny Mandel, and Jimmy Rowles, proved to be just as beautiful as the first. The song “Wouldn’t it be Lovely” from the musical “My Fair Lady” was a crowd pleaser that allowed Sutton to use her full vocal range.  The night ended with two standing ovations and an encore performance of the Bill Evans song “We Will Meet Again,” dedicated to a friend her band recently lost and to her Wesleyan family and friends. “It is wonderful to be back in this space that changed my life,” Sutton said. “It was a successful fund-raiser for the Green Street Art Center,” said Dean of the College Maria Cruz-Saco. “The GSAC is a powerful concept that Wesleyan fully and enthusiastically supports. Tierney Sutton’s generosity is creating a model relationship for others to follow.” Lillian Siegel ’08 said that Sutton was a particularly good choice for parents weekend. “My dad laughed when she said she sympathizes with parents who are paying way too much for their children to go here who in the end can’t do anything useful with their major,” Siegel said. “It was inspiring to hear how much of the world was opened to her when she came to Wesleyan.”"

		"title": "Film Commentary: Women in Hollywood",
		"date": "2006-04-28",
		"authors": "by Matt Connolly, Assistant Arts",
		"content": "Make the trip to Destinta and see “Friends with Money.” A witty and wise study of friendship and class in elite Los Angeles, this bittersweet new comedy starring Jennifer Aniston, Joan Cusack, Catherine Keener, and Frances McDormand is simply terrific. As the artery-clogging onslaught of greasy summer blockbusters grows closer by the day, this perfectly tossed salad of a movie, light yet surprisingly filling, provides a refreshing antithesis. It also provides the most intriguingly implicit commentary on the state of women in Hollywood in some time. If “Friends with Money” existed within a social vacuum, it would still be worth seeing for its mercurial mix of satiric detail, evocative grace notes, and note-perfect performances by four talented and graceful actresses. But, in our paparazzi-saturated culture, celebrity persona inevitably seeps into both casting choices and audience reactions. Writer/director Nicole Holofcener’s decision to cast Aniston as a pot-smoking, rudderless maid and Cusack, McDormand, and Keener as her wealthy and successful friends succeeds within the context of her film due to the vanity-free performances she gets from her quartet of actresses. Her skill as a chronicler of love, sex, aging, and other mid-life adventures amongst women over thirty-five detaches the audience from reality and allows us to savor the jewel-like moments of humor and heartbreak. View the film outside of this context and the ironies are hard to deny. In reality, Jennifer Aniston’s angular face will be plastered on more magazines this year than Cusack, McDormand, and Keener’s will in a decade. In reality, the former “Friends” star has had her love life dissected for the last year and a half by a voracious tabloid machine; no one seems to be checking up on McDormand’s marriage to Joel Coen with any degree of frequency. To see Aniston scrubbing toilets while Cusack shops for $80 children’s sneakers and Keener oversees an addition on her suburban palace is to acknowledge that Aniston is the real Hollywood royalty, while the other three are beloved “character actresses.” In mainstream Hollywood, McDormand plays the mom, not the romantic lead. Keener supplies the wiseacre jokes, not the second half of a romantic duo (“The 40 Year Old Virgin” notwithstanding). Cusack is the ditz, not the heroine. “Character actresses” (read: not a size 0) of “a certain age” (read: over 40) don’t get the leads; they’re too “quirky.” Aniston, bless her heart, does not fit the vacuous bimbo-babe model that acts as the Hollywood baseline. Taking roles like films like “Friends with Money” and Miguel Artera’s “The Good Girl” reflects a sincere, straining desire to be remembered as more than just Rachel Green, a longing so palpable it’s almost touching. And here, freed from both sitcom shtick and the self-consciously glum aimlessness of “The Good Girl”, she gives a sweet and salty performance of admirable understatement. That being said, she is undeniably buoyed by her co-stars, so often forgotten by the Hollywood mainstream for the mistake of aging gracefully rather than Botox-ing themselves into frozen-faced oblivion. Aniston’s character, Olivia, may be cleaning up the stains here. Audience members can’t help but be aware, however, that Jennifer Aniston, burgeoning movie star and formerly married to one-half of Brangelina, will be seen not two months later in “The Break-Up”, a potential mainstream smash. And where will Cusack (43) or Keener (46) or McDormand (48) be? Working, no doubt; but with little hope of getting the kind of lead roles in mainstream Hollywood films that Aniston (37) has at her finger tips. There are no easy solutions to the frustrating double standards currently at work in Hollywood. Look no further than the continual casting of such graying former heartthrobs as Richard Gere in romantic leads for proof. However, there is hope to be taken from films like “Friends with Money”, and particularly from directors like Nicole Holofcener. Given the aforementioned outside perspective audiences bring into her film, Holofcener (herself in her mid 40s) could have taken the opportunity to make a loud and obvious statement about gender inequality in the film world. Instead, she celebrates all the women on screen, with a generous and watchful eye whose blunt honesty emanates from a place of intelligent warmth. “Friends with Money” has very little in the way of plot momentum; Roger Ebert, in a recent two-star review, deemed the film “more of an idea than a story.” Yet it’s this very shapelessness that allows the audience to bask in the glow of Holofcener’s multi-faceted on-screen creations, women of substance and shortfalls and strength. Whatever they’re standing in the off-screen world, all four actresses in “Friends with Money” are on equal creative footing.  This personal, candid, and unapologetically feminine cinematic perspective of character over plot mechanics, minor-key reflection over earth-shattering revelation, may just be the best way to combat the gender and age bias at work in mainstream filmmaking. Holofcener’s work, unfortunately, reaches a limited number of people. In the wake of indie hit “Lost in Translation”, though, Sofia Coppola seems primed to expose a larger audience to her poetic, free-flowing vision of lost souls adrift in a world both bewildering and exhilarating. Her “Marie Antoinette” plays in competition at Cannes next month and opens in October. And Catherine Hardwicke, who exploded out of the gate in 2003 with her scalding teen-girl drama “Thirteen”, returns this December with “Nativity”, a picture of the life of the Virgin Mary before Jesus. And anyone who attempts to peg her, or any of these directors, as “for chicks only” needs only to see Hardwicke’s “Lords of Dogtown”, an underrated film that shows male skateboarders as fractious and insecure as any stereotypical “mean girl” clique. In a perfect world, one could watch a film like “Friends with Money” and not associate casting with the hypocrisy of the current Hollywood system, and directors like Holofcener may yet change this. Until that day comes, however, the sight of Jennifer Aniston in a maid’s outfit and Frances McDormand in designer gowns cannot help but make you think: in Hollywood’s eyes, the roles are reversed."

		"content": "President Bennet’s announcement that he will step down after the 2006-2007 school year has inevitably brought to mind everything he has accomplished here since 1995, for better and for worse. As the nationwide search for his replacement is set to begin, we ask those in charge of selecting a new president to learn from Bennet’s time as president and, most importantly, actually listen to and value student input. In his years here, Bennet has proved to be an incredibly successful fundraiser. Alumni donations have increased exponentially and, under his leadership, the University has undertaken a massive strategic plan. For the most part, things are going as planned. The new Usdan University Center, set to open in Fall 2007, is taking shape. New buildings and renovations have renewed the campus. Aside from the aesthetically and functionally questionable Zelnick Pavilion, these changes are welcome and much needed. While there is still work to do to improve town-gown relations, Bennet and his staff have worked hard to improve Middletown-Wesleyan relations, and he has been involved with various projects on Green Street and elsewhere. The perception of Wesleyan from outside the bubble has improved, but internally, more can and should be done to ensure that student voices play a role in big decisions, next year and in the years that follow. In that vein, a shortcoming of Bennet and his administration has been an unsettling tendency to ignore student opinion on important topics, such as chalking and gender neutral housing. The measures taken against fraternities on campus have been unnerving for current members, as well as angered alumni. Bennet and the administration need to be in consistent dialogue with the student body, through the WSA and other means. More frequent and regular meetings at which students can directly voice their concerns to the administration are a good idea as well. A university president needs to stay in constant contact with the students, which has not always been the case as of late. Administrative decisions often lack transparency, and are instead unnecessarily secretive. And when decisions are handed down, administrators shy away from explaining their thinking, apart from saying,“it’s been decided.” We would like to see this change. Nonetheless, we appreciate the great things Doug and Midge Bennet have done for this university. They are clearly dedicated to Wesleyan (and each other). We wish them the best whether they are here at Wesleyan, out sailing, or traveling the world visiting their grandchildren."

		"title": "Bennet announces retirement",
		"date": "2006-05-05",
		"authors": "by Hilary Moss, News Editor",
		"content": "President Doug Bennet announced his retirement yesterday afternoon to a crowd of 500 gathered outside of North College. After serving for 12 years, Bennet will leave the University at the end of the 2006-2007 academic year. “Wesleyan is positioned well to engage new leadership, and the time is right for us to move ahead with the new phase of our lives,” Bennet said. “The work we did to define a Wesleyan education for the 21st century, to improve student aid, to add faculty, and to begin a process of campus renewal—all of these show that Wesleyan can make big decisions and act on them.” Bennet thanked alumni, faculty, staff, and students for their generosity. He also praised the support of alumni and parent volunteers, the faculty’s excellence, the quality of the administrative team, and the Board of Trustees’ strong leadership.  “Wesleyan is doing well both institutionally and in its daily pursuit of excellence,” he said. Dean of Natural Sciences and Mathematics Joe Bruno said he believes Bennet is choosing an appropriate time to retire. “I think Doug has thought carefully and realizes this is the optimal time to go,” Bruno said. “We’ve just come off a successful campaign and we’re thinking of another one in the near future. This leaves us time to have a new president in place.” Bruno also mentioned Bennet’s unabashed love for the University. “[Bennet’s] love for the place is clear any time you talk to him,” Bruno said. “He has a strong confidence in Wesleyan’s ability to get things done.” Chair of the Philosophy Department Professor Brian Fay pointed to Bennet’s ambitious on-campus construction program as one of his main achievements. “We hadn’t done buildings for years,” Fay said. “I think the strategic plan that was put into place in the mid-90s that served for the basics of his capital campaign was so successful in restoring to Wesleyan a sense of direction and purpose.” Fay also noted that Bennet repaired and improved town-gown relations. “Wesleyan was involved in the Middletown Inn and donated four million dollars to it,” Fay said. “There was also the Green Street Arts Center initiative, the service learning center, and the community partnerships building.” President Diana Chapman Walsh of Wellesley College, where Bennet serves on the Board of Trustees, commented on Bennet’s off-campus work. “We all look up to him and admire and appreciate him tremendously,” she said. “I got a chance to see firsthand the impact that he’s had [at Wesleyan]. He is a remarkable leader at Wesleyan and a spokesperson with a wide understanding of public policy issues and how change happens in world.” Walsh, who coincidentally announced her own retirement last Friday, described Bennet as someone who is “delightful and fun” with a great sense of humor.  Although many students will be sad to see Bennet leave, others question his performance at the University. Bea Lake ’06 said that Bennet hasn’t been a popular figure for a long time. “There’s nothing to say for sure that anything will necessarily get better with him gone and I don’t know there’s anything to say it will get worse,” Lake said. “He’s stood in the way of student causes and student voices, but I have no confidence that shuffling the person occupying that place will fix things. It’s more a structural problem. In part it’s his unwillingness to listen, but also it’s the nature of the position.” In his brief speech outside North College, Bennet described an educational community’s daily progress as ongoing and revolving on discovery, teaching, care, and respect. “The daily work shows who we really are,” he said. “It helps individual students define their values and learn the confidence that will empower them as change-makers. It reveals how well we are making good on the potential of our diversity.” Midge Bennet remarked that living on campus has been a happy time in the couple’s life together, and that she is looking forward to spending one more year at the University. “Doug and I will stay close to Wesleyan living nearby, here in Connecticut, and having more time to read and go sailing and visit with our grandchildren,” she said.  The Bennets have eight grandchildren, all six years old or younger, who live around the world, from Germany to California. “We hope to be invited to Wesleyan performances and lectures and sporting events and to lunch at the new Usdan Center, and to continue helping Wesleyan in any way we can,” Midge said. After his speech, President Bennet reflected on the accomplishments that stand out for him at Wesleyan, which include improved curriculum, town-gown relations, strategic planning, fundraising, and reducing reliance on the endowment. Chair of the Board of Trustees James van B. Dresser ’63 offered the Board’s congratulations and thanks, noting that the University has never been in better shape. According to Dresser, the Board will meet at the end of the month to discuss the future search for the new president.  “The Board will work alongside [the Bennets] to make this transition period not just smooth, but positive and memorable for all of us,” he said. “I promise I will keep the campus community fully informed about the process and that we will keep students, faculty, and staff fully involved.” According to trustee Michael McPherson, the Board has not yet looked into any candidates for the new president. “You want somebody of intellectual depth who understands what a place like Wesleyan is about,” McPherson said. “You always expect a new president to come with her or his new ideas, but a lot of things are already going well. We’ll be looking for a blend of innovation and continuity.” McPherson also stressed that student input will be part of the design of the search process. “I hope that the next president is younger and more in touch with the student body,” said Russell Berg ’07. “Bennet was always a little standoffish and a little aristocratic…the type that’s good at running a university, but his personality didn’t jibe with students.” Berg also noted that much of the administration has been replaced over the last school year. “There’s not much of a sense of continuity except maybe the Board of Trustees, the puppet masters pulling all of the strings,” Berg said. “They’re always there.”"

		"title": "Open letter to President Bennet from Benjamin ’57",
		"date": "2006-12-01",
		"authors": "by Martin Benjamin,",
		"content": "Dear Doug,   In your response to Talya Zemach-Bersin’s cri de coeur you quote a few words of the bubble-bunkered student’s neo-Marxist babble: “I am highlighting their (the Bennets) blatant insensitivity and denial of the systems and methods whereby those who are not white, male, heterosexual, and wealthy are marginalized and often met with resistance, in a world that is dominated by rich white heterosexual men, regardless of how hard they work.” (“They” are the marginalized, not “rich white heterosexual men.” Unsyntactically speaking, Zemach-Bersin is a repeat offender.)  You said that you were stung by her critique of your rendition of your career at the dinner you hosted for this year’s Wesleyan Service Career Fellows. Said rendition, I gather, attributed your success in the realm of public service less to talent and effort than to privilege  the privilege of being a rich, white, heterosexual man. Except that you said it tongue-in-cheek, which means that you didn’t mean it: You made it on your own, and not because of privilege, etc. Granted, allowed the lady (maybe she figures that you’re the exception that proves the rule). Nonetheless, you were chastised for “blatant insensitivity.”  You, of all people. Was it not you who’d mandated sensitivity training for the staff, yourself included? (Good for you, Doug). The infantilizing indignities of mandatory sensitivity training are nothing new to the students, of course. And yet the Argus reports that offenses are up. Could it be that mandates breed resentment and resentment breeds offenders? No, you inveigh: the increase must be “alcohol-related.” Doug, be a mensch: accept responsibility.  You speak of Wesleyan’s “academic rigor.” That’s boilerplate. I can recall a student who asked me how to write a footnote. Was she a first-semester freshman? No, a final-semester senior—it wasn’t until a month before graduation that she wrote an essay requiring one; all previous papers were exercises in navel-gazing: How do you ‘feel’ about Weber’s theory of Protestantism and capitalism?  That kind of thing.  You speak of “a rigorous Wesleyan education.” More boilerplate (you’re laying it on too thick). I can recall a Chinese teaching assistant who was told to dumb things down for his biology class; he had to make it “real easy,” he told me. I can recall an Indian teaching assistant who said he’d tried to teach his class not only WHAT mathematical formula to apply to a problem, but WHY. His students complained to the department chairman, who ordered him to teach the What without the Why.  Those two foreign students (and surely others) had come to  Wes with a reservoir of good will and respect for her; they’d left with that reservoir drained and refilled with disdain.  I can recall (and so can you) when virtually every faculty member read the Argus, at the time a NEWSpaper. I can recall the Beta Symposium on anxiety (“The Age of Angst”), in which professors read papers the Betas had asked them to write especially for the occasion. Doug, could you imagine a fraternity presenting such a diversion today? The symposium was food for thought, not action—we didn’t presume to have all the answers. Nor were we encouraged by President Butterfield, a gentleman of the Old School, to think that we did. How times (and presidents) have changed.       A professor to whom I recently addressed a Wespeak emailed his reply. Why no open letter?  Because, he said, he wished to avoid provoking one of those “endless squabbles” the students delight in. In Old Wes we didn’t have time for squabbles. I don’t know about you, Doug, but pretty much all that I had time for was Olin, whose Reserve Room (now Microfilms) was open and peopled with studious mooks (remember the term, Doug?) 24/7.       Fast forward fifty years. Erik Rosenberg ’08, in his Nov. 3 Wespeak, hectors his fellow students: “As a college student, you, more than anybody else in this country, have the time and resources to be politically active. You live in an environment that can be easily turned into a formidable political power. 95 percent of the people you live, learn, eat, fuck, party, and shit with have similar opinions regarding the war; all we need to do is walk onto the street together and were a force to be reckoned with. Channel your diligence and intelligence into something REAL.  Just the fact that you are in college means you have time to be political.” A student after your own heart, Doug.  Rosenberg quotes Director of Media Relations David Pesci: “The university is very careful not to openly take any political stance or promote any political agenda.” “Not openly” can hide a multitude of sins. In your letter to Zemach-Bersin you say: “Corporate America and some professions are less permeable than education or the not-for-profit sector, but even they are getting the word.” The word. Let none dare call it “openly” political.  With all due respect, Doug, may I ask what qualifies you to be giving “the word” to corporate America? If I didn’t know better I would be tempted to dub you an ideologue in drag, a dude who masquerades as an educator. Have you ever graded a blue book or paper? According to your resume, your entire career has been spent in the wealth-consuming public sector; yet you condescend to educate the wealth-creating private sector, the sector in which the Davisons, Denisons, Olins, Thorndikes, Walter Wristons, and many another alum have prospered. And thanks to their generous love for their alma mater, you’re able to live the High life in your servant-furnished mansion, and Talya Zemach-Bersin is able to be a Wesleyan Service Career Fellow. And when she bites the hand that feeds her, flaying “a world that is dominated by rich white heterosexual men,” you stroke her resentment.  She mangles her syntax because her instructors, failing to correct the lass, repeatedly gave her a pass. What’s your excuse? You write: “Thinking about the recent dinner, the guests would have been all male and virtually all white in 1959, my senior year at Wesleyan. This was ridiculous in retrospect.” Not half as ridiculous as the admission of Wesleyan’s Rodney Dangerfields (women) and the reactionary restoration of segregation in virtually all-black Malcolm X House. It bears your Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, even though its presence couldn’t be less consistent with the assimilationist position you took in your undergraduate years. (You forced the integration of a local all-white barber shop and induced your fraternity to disaffiliate from the national organization because it refused to integrate.) When will you acknowledge your flip-flop? (And when will you acknowledge that “The Art and Science of Education since 1831” is a lumbering, dime-store logo coined by a lumbering, dime-store mind? “The Cardinal Choice” is choicer.)  You say that “Wesleyan was able to change for the better” Under your tenure? In 1995 you swaggered into town and boasted that under your aegis the school, then Number 6 in US News rankings, would be one of the top three. Last year it failed to make the top ten.  As for that precious intangible, “the Wesleyan experience,” when you stroll through Exley’s lobby, its floor bestrewn with all the news that’s fit to print; when you walk across a campus littered with paper and plastic detritus; when you ascend the steps to Olin and pass a raggedy clothesline strung across its iconic Ionic columns gowned in handbills and/or garish plastic sheaths; when you shut your eyes to those blatant indicators of spoiled children despoiling their Cardinal choice (and soiling themselves in the process); when you have a student from an urban ghetto who pushed a fellow student through a plate glass window and faced no charges, owing to your good offices; when you have girls in women’s bodies hooking up in hopes of winning the coveted title of “Miss Disposable Commodity”; when you read the Wespeak pages trivia, incoherence, bathroom humor, and verbal ejaculations (“F*** you!”) hurled at girls; and when, having shut your ears to those hostile intonations, you declare, in the tone of a man who holds his truths to be self-evident, ‘new and improved’ Wes superior to Old Wes, all I can say is, “Doug,  whatever you say.” Which is ridiculous."

		"title": "Syracuse U. president applies town-gown relations to Wes",
		"date": "2006-12-01",
		"authors": "by Katherine Manchester, Assistant News",
		"content": "Interactive, reciprocal initiatives between colleges and their local communities are essential for higher education to continue to enrich society, guest speaker Nancy Cantor said in a Center for the Arts (CFA) lecture on Wednesday night in the Memorial Chapel. “Momentum is growing to take public scholarship seriously, as a movement that will challenge and reshape the relationship between our colleges and universities and the society of which they are a part,” she said.  Cantor is the 11th chancellor and president of Syracuse University, in Syracuse, New York. She has gained national recognition for her strong advocacy in favor of public scholarship, a policy that she sees as fundamental if universities seek to benefit their communities. “If universities are to continue to expand our essential role in our democracy, producing innovation that makes a difference and educating enthusiastic citizens as well as skilled technicians, we must learn to construct these local collaborations in shared third spaces,” she said.  In the practice of public scholarship, Cantor said, the outward-looking stance of the projects often cut across the boundaries of traditional disciplines, geographies and roles. “The enterprise itself changes the relationship between expert and novice, between teaching, scholarship, and civic engagement—often rolling them all into one,” she said.  Cantor cited a number of Syracuse’s efforts to develop public scholarship, including the renovation of an old furniture warehouse in downtown Syracuse to house the university’s School of Architecture. “The Warehouse” also contains a public gallery, a café, and meeting rooms to be used by local artists and other community members.   “We are seeing the catalyzing effect of both the Warehouse itself and the concentration of design and entrepreneurial expertise downtown,” Cantor said.  At the moment, Syracuse’s most ambitious project is participation in constructing a “Connective Corridor,” a street that will run all the way across New York State in order to link suburbs with downtowns. In Syracuse’s case, this street will serve to connect the university with the city. “This will be a cultural corridor,” said Cantor. “It will connect all of the city’s cultural institutions [like] the local historical society, museums, concert halls, theaters, and galleries.”   Cantor stressed that, if carried out successfully, public scholarship initiatives allow universities and communities to interact in three crucial ways. “First, there is innovation that matters locally,” she said. “Public scholarship promotes discovery work outside of the ivory tower. Second, it promotes conversations that change the dialogue from seeing citizenship as a matter of stakeholder rights, to an act of community building among citizens with responsibilities to each other. Third, it brings new and diverse voices to the table, which has a strong democratizing effect.”  In the lengthy question-and-answer session that followed, Cantor addressed the audience’s queries about the finer points of public scholarship, and what stood in the way of such programs.  “Everyone thinks the question of money is the hardest,” she said, “But we have found that if projects are clearly seen as for, by, and with the community, they take on a lot of momentum very quickly, which galvanizes support. We don’t do projects within the community unless we have multiple partners.” Cantor noted that one of the greatest challenges was promoting the idea of change at a local level. “Sometimes people view local initiatives as parochial and narrow,” she said. “They ask, ‘What about the big picture?’ I don’t know about Middletown, but Syracuse has instances of every single global problem out there, especially in terms of immigration.”  One student questioned changes in perceptions of student safety, given a situation where so much community-student interaction was taking place. “I don’t think that students are any more at risk downtown than they are on University Hill, but we took the issue very seriously because we knew that safety concerns would be a psychological barrier to students’ comfort,” Cantor said.  While the audience was relatively small and consisted primarily of faculty and administrators, Cantor was well received.  Lauren Tinkoff ’07, student coordinator for the Green Street Arts Center, enjoyed the talk and found Cantor’s ideas applicable to the University community. “The lecture was especially relevant to me because Green Street is a practical application of the theory she discussed,” Tinkoff said. “Her talk was an inspiration to Wesleyan to expand its partnerships with Middletown and see the potential for positive change.”"

		"title": "Scobey urges an end to insular academic attitudes",
		"date": "2007-02-09",
		"authors": "by Chelsea Sprayregan, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "David Scobey believes he has the solution for two cultural crises.  Speaking last Wednesday at the Memorial Chapel, he discussed the growing movement toward integration of university arts and humanities with community engagement.  Scobey emphasized the benefits that such integration would have in solving the respective problems of the university and the community at large. The universities’ predicament, Scobey explained, is a growing public disillusionment with higher education.  Citing budget cuts and a referendum vote against affirmative action in Michigan as evidence, Scobey explained that the public no longer considers the universities’ vast resources and autonomy to be justified.  These attitudes, accompanied by rising tuition rates throughout the country, have further entrenched the universities’ reputation as a bastion of elitism, isolated from general society. According to Scobey, this issue goes hand-in-hand with a larger societal crisis: that of growing distrust in government.  While widespread voter apathy presents the most obvious evidence of this skepticism, Scobey maintained it is only a symptom of a larger problem. Scobey argued that these crises can only be solved together, through community partnerships with university arts and humanities.  He advocated the creation of third spaces, where members of diverse groups can come together in collaborative ways to develop both civic culture and intellectual life, with the underlying belief that each group can offer the other something it could not have gleaned on its own. Members of the academic community, Scobey said, can gain a richer understanding of the people they purport to explain.   Scobey emphasized that the university need not lose any of its academic rigor, but rather that professional academics must apply this intellectualism in new ways based on insights they would not otherwise have found.  Scobey described the moment when he chose to work toward community engagement. “It felt like a turn away from the provincialism of academic culture in which I’d boxed myself,” Scobey said. In an often polarized society, Scobey explained that these community programs can help people to gain understanding of groups with which they would not normally engage.  More importantly, these diverse groups can work together, using the arts and humanities, in the process of “meaning making,” and thus regain a stake in their own civic life.  Given this dynamic definition of culture, university humanities and the arts must participate in the process of meaning making, or else its work of understanding society becomes a falsity. Scobey has directed two centers for community partnerships, and he used his experiences to ground otherwise abstract ideas in examples of successful projects.  Scobey spoke of a piece of artwork he recently viewed, a collage of different media that included interviews with members of the Arab community in Dearborn, MI and a poem about riding the subway after Sept. 11.  The piece came to fruition through the University of Michigan’s Arts of Citizenship program, of which he is former director. As present director of the Harward Center for Community Partnerships at Bates College, Scobey is working with a group of students in collaboration with a local museum to create an exhibit honoring the experience of Franco-American mill workers in Bates’ hometown of Lewiston, ME.  Scobey stressed the importance of collaboration within both projects.  “We create products and insights that none of us could create separately,” Scobey said. Before his lecture, Scobey spent the day at both the University and the Green Street Arts Center.  “It’s potentially just the kind of ‘third space,’ co-developed by the University and the community, where transformative work can happen that will enrich both Middletown’s North End community and the Wesleyan education,” Scobey said. The audience of arts and humanities faculty, community partners, and a few students proved highly receptive to Scobey’s ideas.  One woman raised her hand at the end simply to thank Scobey for his inspiring lecture.  Most of the questions addressed practical ways in which Scobey’s ideas might be applied. “It was very nice to hear someone talk about interaction rather than just seeing community involvement as going in and fixing whatever problems we see,” said Emily Sheehan ’10. The lecture mostly addressed institutional changes, and thus the faculty who might make them possible.  Yet the students who did attend were impressed.   “I think this is definitely going to give me some added inspiration to figure out what I owe the Middletown community or what I can learn from the Middletown community, and I hope to begin that process soon,” said Ari Tolman ’10. Scobey came to the University after meeting Pamela Tatge, director of Wesleyan’s Center for the Arts, and Rob Rosenthal, director of the University’s Service Learning Center, part of the Center for Community Partnerships, at a consortium of over 70 colleges called Imagining America. Imagining America is committed to work in public scholarships in the arts and humanities.   Tatge and Rosenthal invited Scobey to lecture as part of a series co-sponsored by their respective organizations entitled Scholarship and Action: The Case for Engagement. Nancy Cantor, president of Syracuse University, whom Tatge and Rosenthal also met at Imagining America, gave the series’ keynote address in November.  The three subsequent speakers, Scobey being the first, each represent one of the University’s academic divisions.  Tom Hayden will speak in March on behalf of the social sciences.  The speaker for April, representing math and natural sciences, is yet to be announced."

		"title": "Midge hosts dialogue",
		"date": "2007-02-13",
		"authors": "by Mollie Laffin-Rose, News Editor",
		"content": "On Monday evening, Midge Bennet walked down to HiRise to reveal secrets about the role of first lady at a higher-education institution, living in Middletown’s landmark house, and what retirement holds in store for her and President Doug Bennet. About 15 students attended the hour-long open conversation that ResLife scheduled as a follow-up to President Bennet’s campus-wide dorm visits last semester. When ResLife mentioned to student staff members during August training that President Bennet was interested in visiting dorms, HiRise Residential Advisor (RA) Joe-John Sanchez ’07 extended the invitation. “As soon as they said that [the president was coming], I said, ‘Can Midge come, too?’” Sanchez said. Mrs. Bennet originally planned to accompany the president when he visited HiRise on Nov. 20, but she was unable to come due to a family obligation. Her attend visit this week is currently the only one that ResLife has scheduled. However, Bennet said that she would be happy to visit additional residences if students were interested. “It’s almost even better with just her, to focus on Midge and [her views of] Doug Bennet beyond campus policy,” Sanchez said. HiRise RA Emily Einhorn ’08 welcomed Mrs. Bennet and opened the discussion floor. “We wanted this to be an informal discussion,” Einhorn said. “We wanted to learn about you during your last year at Wesleyan.” Bennet graduated from the University of Georgia with a double major in English and Journalism. Her first professional experience was as a writer in advertising from which she moved on to volunteer in public television in Springfield, MA. In 1978, Bennet transferred to Hartford’s public radio, joining its founding staff as Vice President. Bennet found herself with leadership in an industry dominated by white males but, as she recounted, with no shortage of initiative. “You can’t be ignored for very long,” she said of being one of two women in large national meetings. Bennet’s female counterpart at the meetings was a black leader in public radio. “I don’t mind being the token, do you?” she recalled asking her co-worker. In 1983, Mrs. Bennet joined the National Public Radio (NPR) presidential search committee that ultimately hired Doug Bennet. Several months later, she served under the station’s new president as vice president for representation. They collaborated for the next 10 years, until President Bennet began a two-year tenure in the Clinton administration’s Department of State. The two co-workers began to date in November 1994. In 1995, Doug Bennet began his tenure as the University’s 15th president. In 1996, the two married and Bennet relocated from NPR in Washington, D.C. to Middletown. On campus, she found herself in a novel and challenging position. “I remember asking myself that same question before I even got here,” Mrs. Bennet said when asked what her typical day at the University is. During the Bennets’ first year on campus, Mrs. Bennet volunteered for so many projects that the Board of Trustees invited her to become a consultant. “It’s a nice, round title,” she said. “It develops everywhere. We get to meet so many different kinds of people.” Mrs. Bennet described the wide range of responsibilities that her position entails, from meeting parents and alumni to addressing new potential scholarships or a student’s death. “It involves always knowing that somebody’s going to knock on the door,” she said. “You always remember these very high and very low points.” Mrs. Bennet described her and the president’s campaigns at the University as an effort to invite Middletown into the campus and to improve town-gown relations. To illustrate their efforts, Mrs. Bennet recounted the summer when she and the president first arrived on campus. They hired a construction crew to refurbish the decades-old, dilapidated president’s house on High St., a landmark that exhibits the craftsmanship of generations of Middletown construction workers. After the project was completed, the Bennets held a reception in their new home to thank the crew. Mrs. Bennet repeated what the construction workers said in response to the reception and how it launched her and the president’s involvement in the city. “’In all the time we’ve been in Middletown, no one has ever been invited here before,’ they said,” Mrs. Bennet recalled. “We decided we were going to do what we could to change that.” During the past 12 years, the Bennets have invested in local businesses and hotels, supported the development of Main St., and collaborated on such community-based efforts as the Green Street Arts Center. Mrs. Bennet also noted that her husband meets with Mayor of Middletown Sebastian Giuliano once or twice monthly, without an agenda, to discuss current local events and development ideas. “A lot is going on behind the scenes that isn’t on the calendar every day, but that’s how you move things,” Bennet said. “One-on-one.” As the president approaches the end of his tenure at the University, Bennet said that they are immersing themselves in campus events and anticipating a smooth transition from this administration to the next. After May, the Bennets plan to spend time with their extended family. They have five children and eight grandchildren, expecting a ninth, between them. Midge Bennet’s youngest son, Richard Ramsey, and President Bennet’s youngest daughter, Holly ’94, are also married, having started dating shortly after they met at the Bennets’ wedding. The Bennets also plan to re-enter the political sphere. “All those things you put aside when you become president of a not-for-profit organization,” Mrs. Bennet said of political activism. “You really have to be non-partisan. I don’t care if I lick envelopes or whatever [after retiring]. I want to get back.” Much like President Bennet’s visits in the fall, Mrs. Bennet’s audience on Monday appreciated the opportunity to interact with an administrator in an informal environment. “It’s nice for her to come into our space and talk about things that we want to talk about,” said Petra Groeneveldt ’08."

		"content": "Students and Middletown citizens gathered in PAC 002 last Friday to discuss issues that both have struggled with for years. The meeting centered on topics of concern in Middletown neighborhoods, especially North End’s cycle of poverty and violence, the redevelopment of Main Street’s public transportation, and traffic congestion problems, which could lead to a tunnel built beneath the Connecticut River. The eight panelists represented a broad coalition of local organizations, all with a vested interest in Middletown development, including architects, representatives from the Common Council, the Middletown Redevelopment Agency, the Nehemiah Housing Association, the North End Action Team (NEAT), and the Village District. The meeting was part of the Center for Community Partnership’s First Friday series, uniting students and Middletown citizens on the first Friday of each month to discuss “town-gown” collaborations. To initiate the meeting, each of the eight panelists described their vision for Middletown.  “For me, it’s all about creating a place where people want to live,” said Professor of History Vijay Pinch. Lee Osborne, an architect who served as chairman of the Zoning Committee for eight years, said that one of the reasons he likes Middletown is because it has “texture.”  “Our school system is one of the reasons my wife and I moved here,” Osborne said. “We wanted our children to grow up in a real world.”  However, a number of the panelists were hesitant to attribute too much to Middletown. “Like Bill [Warner, another panelist], I don’t feel we should be pounding our chests about how great downtown is and get overconfident about it,” said Gerry Daley of the Middletown Redevelopment Agency and the Common Council. Mark Maselli of the Village District echoed Daley’s sentiment. “I’ve been thinking long and hard about Middletown, and I’ve come to the conclusion that we are too often doing things that are not Middletown scale,” he said. “We are taking initiatives that are done in Hartford or New Haven and we’re bringing them here to town.” A large part of the dialogue was devoted specifically to problems in the North End. “We have, in the North End, a census track that is extremely poor,” Osborne said. NEAT was formed in 1997 to foster collaboration between citizens, city officials, and students while confronting the drug dealing, violence, and poverty that were prevalent in the North End. Lydia Brewster, a member of NEAT, felt that the organization was successful in putting the North End agenda on the city’s table.  To deal with housing shortages and other struggles with poverty in the North End, some suggested affordable housing units. Village District resident Jennifer Alexander ’88 vehemently opposed this idea. “Anywhere else but the North End,” Alexander said. “I would like to see not one more affordable unit built in the North End. Why? Because it doesn’t work. Economic monoculture does not work.”  Panelists agreed that communication in general is necessary. “To be successful, we have to have a social dialogue,” Maselli said. “And so my view is, we either have an engaged population, one that there is discourse in and at all levels [or we don’t}. If I have a vision, it is the recapturing of our newspapers.” Alexander and Brewster agreed that one issue that makes resolution more difficult is the effort to improve diversity in Middletown schools by redistributing students who live near each other. “Do you know how hard it is to organize a community when a simple thing like the neighborhood school isn’t even in one area?” Alexander asked.  During a question and answer session, one member of the audience asked if there were any plans to tunnel the highway so that Middletown could be more connected to the river.  The Department of Transportation had been pushed to build a tunnel, but money has remained an issue.  Questions also touched on transportation, from the difficulty of finding public transportation to parking lot development on Main Street. “We have too many vehicles on the road today,” Daley said. The panelists rejected the idea of surface parking lots in downtown Middletown and said that the main obstacle to public transportation is the high volume of passengers. “I think that a livable, walkable downtown in America is like a diamond,” Alexander said. Pinch closed on a positive note, expressing pride in his neighborhood. “I love living in Middletown,” Pinch said. “If you don’t get involved in your community, you’re just passing through.”"

		"date": "2007-03-30",
		"authors": "by Ezra Silk, Assistant News",
		"content": "With Michael Roth ’78  announced as incoming president, the campus is cautiously celebrating the choice of an academic candidate and reflecting on the occasionally controversial legacy of departing president Doug Bennet.  Though at present most only have an initial impression of Roth, his long intellectual background in art, history, and psychology has given many people high hopes for an era focused on core academic issues. As for Bennet’s legacy, most agree that the University has significantly changed under his leadership, especially due to the essential fundraising efforts. These helped pull the school out of a twenty-year economic slump, allowing for badly needed building projects. The real question, according to many, is whether the University has changed for the better over the last 12 years and how much of that change was caused  by Bennet or by national academic trends beyond his control.  Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Professor Mike McAlear, a who served on the Faculty Interviewing Panel that helped select the new president, was very impressed by Roth.  “This new guy—he’s articulate, he’s smart, he’s thoughtful,” McAlear said. “If you were to sit down and meet him, you would think that this is a bright, engaging man. Very, very impressive.” Holly Wood ’08 was pleasantly surprised by the choice. “I was really expecting someone from a pharmaceutical or science background, given the push toward the sciences,” Wood said. “They really surprised me with this selection. He’s also coming in and telling the Hartford Courant that he wants to teach classes here, which is fantastic.” Some believe that choosing Roth reflected the changing demographics of the Board of Trustees and the alumni network.  “Think about who is on the committee now,” said Brendan O’Connell ’08. “The alumni who are electing trustees and the trustees who are choosing presidents reflect a new Wesleyan.” The Wesleyan that Bennet found when he took office in 1995 was a fund-starved institution reeling from the years under the unpopular Chace administration. “They had done such a bad job in previous years,” said Joyce Jacobsen, professor of Economics and former chair of the faculty. “When I got here in ’93, they were still cutting positions.”  Over the years, bad investments continued to mar the school’s financial situation. “In the ’60s, Wesleyan used to be the richest school per capita in North America,” McAlear said. “But that dwindled away and there wasn’t adequate fundraising afterwards to maintain that.” And so one of Bennet’s first initiatives was to launch the first fundraising campaign in years—an extremely successful effort that, upon its completion in 2005, had raised $281 million and doubled the endowment.  “The faculty are very thankful for Doug’s fundraising,” Jacobsen said. “It has made us into a university that has not had to use adjuncts and TAs to teach classes.” The new money has funded a variety of projects. These include 20 new teaching positions, 140 new scholarships, a number of economic developments in Middletown, such as the Green Street Arts Center, and, most significantly, a considerable amount of construction on campus. Renovations include the Center for the Americas, the Admissions building, the Patricelli ’92 Theater, Memorial Chapel, and Clark Hall. Some of the new buildings are the Fauver residences, Usdan University Center, Zelnick Pavilion, the Center for Film Studies, and additions to the Freeman Athletic Center. But the manner in which funds are allocated has faced criticism by some.  “If you look at the total sum of it, at least some of that money could have been invested in libraries, faculty salaries, and the core academic mission,” McAlear said. On Sept. 26, 2006, more than 20 faculty members signed a Wespeak that demanded higher faculty salaries and criticized the distribution of funds. “The recent spending decisions have been unbalanced, and have undermined the fundamental strength of the university: the very professors that teach the classes, mentor the students, and conduct the research and scholarship,” they wrote. “Wesleyan wouldn’t be ranked sixth in its class nationwide for academic reputation without them.” The faculty’s salary grievance seems to fit into a sentiment among some professors and students that characterizes Bennet as more focused on campus beautification than on the core academic mission and student concerns. “The balance of priorities has shifted more towards services and facilities,” McAlear said.  Wood also had problems with the allocations.  “Bennet let there be no central campus space for ten years,” Wood said. “I don’t think it was intentional—I just think his priority was to get funds, which he did well. His priority was not to build solidarity among students.” Many students were not as forgiving as Wood. In 2004, a crowd of around 250 students confronted Bennet and barred him in his office for several hours. The group, acting on behalf of a number of different student concerns, demanded greater transparency in Bennet’s decisions.  “It was a systemic critique of how the administration works,” said O’Connell, who participated in the protest. “It was a critique of how they were making decisions behind students’ backs, speaking through the WSA, and assuming that the WSA represents the entire student body.” The action aroused controversy among faculty and students. In a disapproving Wespeak, Emily Frost ’06 distanced herself from the protestors.  “I am truly embarrassed by the way the student body was represented on Wednesday afternoon,” she wrote. “I felt as though one group of student activists appropriated my voice as a Wesleyan student by pretending to represent the entire student body. I hold some of the concerns that were raised on Wednesday, but I would never have treated President Bennet the way that a few members of our student body did.” Bennet did not appreciate what happened, either.  “He was pretty upset about that,” Jacobsen said.  Other issues, such as the controversial chalking ban in 2003, have cemented among some a reputation of an administration that runs the school more like a corporation than a university. In response, groups such as the faculty caucus and the facebook group “Keep Wesleyan Weird,” which was recently featured on the front page of The Hartford Courant, have cropped up.  Yet most agree that stronger corporatist attitudes and a higher priority on campus aesthetics are signs of the times, as opposed to being attributable to the attitudes of an individual president.  “These are national trends, and I certainly don’t blame Bennet,” Jacobsen said. “Changes also occur as an institution gets older.” Wood acknowledged that national trends played a huge role, but she still is not convinced that Bennet did all he could to stop them.  “Bennet let this stuff happen,” she said. “He could have done more to fight against it.” Bennet’s legacy may become easier to assess further down the road. For now, students and faculty alike hold high expectations for the incoming President. Professor of Sociology Rob Rosenthal has been a huge supporter of Bennet’s efforts in improving town-gown relations and helping improve Middletown in general, and he hopes to see more of that in Roth. “Wesleyan has supported the town by revitalizing it without gentrifying it,” Rosenthal said. “I hope the new president will continue in the same direction.” McAlear also hopes that Roth will learn a lesson from his predecessor. “Things are going to be very different than they were under Doug Bennet and [former Vice President] Judith Brown,” McAlear said. “I’m hoping that this administration will be more consultative to the faculty.”"

		"date": "2007-04-03",

		"content": "The presidency of Doug Bennet will be commemorated with song and dance this fall at the CFA Theatre. The Theatre Department recently announced the upcoming production of their original musical, “I’m With Midge!,” which promises to be a frothy, fun-filled romp through a bitterly divisive presidential tenure. “The life and legacy of Doug Bennet has always had a musical quality to it,” said Assistant Professor of Theatre and show director Jacques Footman. “You can especially find it in his public speeches. Where some hear barely audible garble, I hear passion and…pizzazz!” Footman, who will direct a cast of University students, envisions a highly stylized fantasia of light, color, and glorious show tunes. He says he has been working closely with show composer Schmueli Rosenberg to develop songs that will reflect the many sides of the soon-to-be-former president. “There’s Bennet the administrator, Bennet the fund-raiser, Bennet the corporate bureaucrat,” Footman said with a sigh. “What more could a musical theater director ask for?” Recognizing Bennet’s executive role at National Public Radio prior to his presidency, much of Rosenberg’ score will be comprised of sleepy acoustic guitar riffs and vaguely exotic saxophone solos. Complimentary tote bags and coffee mugs will be available at the door with an optional donation of $100.  Footman says he is inspired by the great musicals of the past, and will incorporate them into his production. A pre-Bennet town-gown interaction on Main St. will recall the Sharks-Jets rumble in “West Side Story.” The construction of the Zelnick Pavilion, in an Act I showstopper entitled “It’s Only Ugly If You Look At It,” conjures up the building of the barricades in “Les Miserables.” Aspiring actors seemed thrilled to be portraying such iconic figures. Lucinda Beltway ’10 originally said she’d be vying for the coveted role of Maria Cruz-Saco. She seemed more uncertain when Footman then informed her that, to better reflect her role on campus, Cruz-Saco would never be seen on-stage, but would be represented through a series of poetically read e-mails.  “It’s still an amazing part, though” Beltway said. “I mean, her e-mails were so…constant.” Dave Zingler ’09, meanwhile, insists he has what it takes to play “the big man” himself. “I totally got the voice,” Zingler said. Upon being complimented on demonstrating this voice, Zingler left in a huff. “You could understand what I was saying? Damn it! I thought I had it!” Zingler yelled as he walked away. Footman says the path to production has been a long one, fraught with obstacles. He particularly regrets writing the entire libretto and score in chalk in front of Davenport Campus Center. Bennet’s famous chalking ban went into effect the day after its completion. “Looking back, a Word document might have been a better choice,” Footman said."

		"title": "Q and A with President-elect Michael Roth",
		"date": "2007-05-01",
		"authors": "by Greg DubinskyEric Lach, Editors-in-Chief",
		"content": "Saturday morning, we sat down with Michael Roth to ask him about his trip, his personal experiences as a student, and his plans for Wesleyan come fall. Note that the interview is edited for brevity and clarity.  Greg Dubinsky: I was thinking about the focus of your work while you were speaking [in the Memorial Chapel on Friday], this idea of freedom through work. I almost felt like I was reading Introduction to the Reading of Hegel. [Editor’s note: This is a book written by a philosopher, Alexander Kojéve, whose correspondence Michael Roth edited.] Michael Roth: (Laughs) Oh goodness gracious, that’s right, you’re on the inside. GD: It was interesting to me to find out a bit more about that, and how you would connect that idea to practical outcomes and issues such as chalking or the independence of departments, or how that translates into practice.  MR: I think the way it would play out in specific Wesleyan policy or around Wesleyan issues is something I don’t know enough yet about to comment in an interesting way. Someone gave me a box of chalk yesterday and my daughter immediately grabbed it thinking it was for her. She said, can I play with this? “No!” What I was trying to say yesterday in regard to freedom and work was that the education at Wesleyan taught me that there was a way one could work that was an expression of what one hoped to be. And getting a sense of that as a social scientist, a biologist, a musician or a writer, whatever the field, gives one a sense of human capacity and a feeling of freedom that sets a platform for how one wants to work after graduation. One wants to find a way of working in the world that is significant for oneself and one sees making a contribution in the world. And there are lots of ways to do that. It doesn’t have to be through some narrow prism of academic work or narrow version of activism. So the contrast I was trying to draw was between that and the kind of work where one feels alien to oneself. Work that most people have to do in our culture. Which is, it may be monetarily satisfying, or not, but you don’t feel like yourself when you’re at work. What I learned at Wesleyan, from doing it myself and from looking around at people who were joyful about what they were doing, was that there are ways of being dedicated to a pursuit that allows you to discover who you are and what you want to be and how you can make a difference in the world.  Autonomy of departments, I don’t know. I don’t know enough about what that means at Wesleyan. I’m not a departmentally oriented academic. I can say that. It’s probably pretty clear from what I’ve done. I don’t believe in the silos of academic departments, I think that requirements are bad. I learned that here—we debated that endlessly when I was a student. I think it’s great for students to have the freedom to choose the kinds of courses they want to take and to make their own way. Sometimes that can be within a structure. If you’re a music major, there’s a structure of how to progress, or [also] if you’re a biology major. Sometimes it can be much more self-generated, as I had a University major. I think the key is that you are following your passion and you are discovering what you love to do. My sense is that the reason a lot of students become so loyal to Wesleyan is that they really do discover what they love to do here. Then they get better at it and that’s great fun and exciting. And they make friends around their work and sometimes through their work. And that’s a gift I believe. As a result, students may be critical of the University, because they want it to be even better, to provide that all the time or in a deeper way, but they are also incredibly loyal to the University because of that gift, because of that experience. I hope that begins to answer that question. Six months out, your successors can expect a more detailed answer.  Eric Lach: It seems people were pretty pleased with your talk yesterday in Memorial Chapel. I’m wondering how you set out to write your introduction? MR: (Laughs) I didn’t write anything, I didn’t know what I was going to say. I do have this, I don’t know what to call it, maybe it’s a symptom, maybe it’s a tick, maybe it’s a style. I do like to improvise. I guess I learned that at Wesleyan. I took jazz piano lessons here from a wonderful instructor.  Justin gave me a couple of points, to thank so and so. And I looked at those in the afternoon, and then I was thinking in the afternoon, “What am I going to talk about, what am I going to talk about, this is too important, Roth, to do your typical improvisation.”  In San Francisco, I do a lot of public speaking, and it’s like a dog that can sing—“Gosh, he’s improvising again.” And I enjoy that and people seem to like it. But I thought this is going to be webcast, I can’t say, “Whoa, I didn’t really say that.” “Yes, you did!” And I kept wondering if I should write it down, I heard the voices of authority saying, “You should write it out, you’re a writer.” But I really felt like the energy would be better, and everybody said it should be brief, if I just said what came to mind.  So, I thought, okay, as you know, I spent a lot of time with Hegel at Wesleyan and since, so I do think in threes. So I thought: if I have three points in my head I won’t get lost. And then it just occurred to me when I saw the police car in front of South College as we were getting photographs, I thought, “Okay, I’ll do liberty, equality, and fraternity.” So then I was a little nervous, because I thought, that’s all I knew that I was going to do, talk about freedom, equality, and, when I teach I translate “fraternity” into “solidarity” or “community” because I think it’s the contemporary expression of that ideal—it’s not sexist. And I remembered when I had this notion of freedom and work, which was here at Wesleyan, so I thought it would be fitting to say that, but I didn’t know what I was going to say. And my wife said, “I think you have four things, because you put diversity in there.” But I didn’t think of it until I said it. So last night I listened to it on the web just to see what the hell I said! (Laughs) And being in a chapel, I’m a wannabe rabbi, people say, or preacher, and so when I get in a chapel I’m even more inclined to [just] see what happens. So the process was really to come up with the structure of three things and then see what happens. When you’re playing jazz or rock and roll, it’s even simpler, you need a three-chord progression. If you know you are going to do A, D, and E, you’ll see what happens. EL: So we shouldn’t expect a reign of terror next year, though, right? MR: I did think of that. Somebody might say the Nazis said, “Work makes free.” So there are lots of incredibly oppressive versions of these ideals. But that’s true of great ideals—some people distort them into horrible things. And that’s something to be mindful of. But I don’t think it’s a reason not to be idealistic, it’s just a reason to be thoughtful. GD: It seems that part of the definition of freedom is having the capacity to affect one’s environment, and maybe a corresponding obligation to affect one’s environment in a positive way. I’m wondering what your thoughts are on Wesleyan’s connection to Middletown and how that might play out in your administration? MR: I heard really positive things about how Doug Bennet and Midge Bennet have built partnerships with Middletown. And I want to understand that better. My own interest and values lead me to want to develop connections for the students and the institution with the city we’re a part of and the state we’re a part of. I think it’s really important for students to understand not only the campus they’re on, but the city they’re in, and the political context in which they live—beyond the campus. That would mean like service learning, which I know has become more important at Wesleyan over the years, but it also means project-based curriculum, which interests me a great deal. Where students can actually take classes, the content of which is heavily inflected by practical projects in the world, and that can be in a science class or in a political science class [or others].  I think that participation is a key value in the arts, so students learning how to not only perform for spectators but to engage people into participatory art-making is a really interesting experience and very educational, and it also is great for the people who are invited into the mix of making. And I’ve done all those things with colleagues in Claremont and Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, and I would expect to find opportunities to do that here. I haven’t been to the Green St. Center yet, but I understand it’s a really interesting place and I’ve gotten notes from people who work there and I look forward to visiting it. And there may be other avenues for that connection to happen, and I would certainly be very supportive of developing those connections. They’re not just expressions of altruism, which is not a bad thing, but they are really vehicles for learning—for students, faculty, and staff. One of the things you learn is about citizenship and being part of the community, which I do think is connected to the values I talked about yesterday.  I muck around on the guitar and piano, it’s not something I can do unless it’s a really good party, but playing a little bit changes the way you listen, and dancing a little bit changes the way you watch, and I think that’s a very important experience to have. The practice of creativity, the practice of thinking, changes the way you understand what people who are experts in the area say.  GD: Should there be a mandatory commitment to civil [or] civic service? MR: There could be, you know that’s where you would no doubt detect a contradiction, if I wanted that, because I don’t like mandatory commitments. I have in the past thought about that. At other places like CCA my first thought was, “We have requirements, why don’t we have a service learning requirement and why don’t we just hire people that teach that way,” but it was the wrong thought. Because what happens when you make things a requirement is that people aren’t interested in them. So I don’t know if requirements are the answer here. I kind of doubt it, just given a little of what I know so far. But making it really great is what draws people, and then they’ll want to do it. Again, I do think sometimes structure is important, but my prejudice is to not go to that structure too early. Invitations are better than force.  EL: So you mentioned yesterday at the student talk that you had been involved in a takeover of the president’s office. I was wondering what you were protesting.  MR: Oh, God, did I say that? That had to be improvised. We were protesting apartheid. The reason I hesitate is because the other big protest I was involved in was—well, less involved with when I was here afterwards—was Seabrook, New Hampshire, a very hot issue in the late ’70s. The nuclear power plant at Seabrook gives me food for my political philosophy classes today.  EL: So you guys took it over for a day, or a couple of days? MR: No, I don’t think it was a couple of days. I remember it was probably a day, a day or so. It would be, I guess, ’77-’78, that year. I remember President [Colin] Campbell coming in and being very gracious. What happened was, and I think this is what we wanted, is that it became a conversation about how to engage the issue at the university level. I’ve learned about it since and talking with people about [how] what the University did in regard to divestment in companies doing business with South Africa was really an engagement with those companies, forcing them to explain themselves in a public way, because as stockholders you had this kind of leverage, which if you just sold your stock you’d no longer have. So it was a very interesting process, much more sophisticated than I understood at the time. Part of it came out of the fact that there was a community revulsion against the regime in South Africa—it took longer in a way, but I think in a way it was a more significant action of engaging these companies, forcing them to respond to these political and moral issues. GD: So success can be a difficult thing to define for many at a university like Wesleyan. I’m wondering: how would you measure [the] success of Wesleyan while you are there? Would you rely on the U.S. News and World Report? What would be the criteria that you would use to measure how you’re doing, where you can improve? MR: There are a couple of things. It’s a really important question, and I want to determine in the next few months which metrics would be the most important and to use them. Everyone seems to agree that Wesleyan is underresourced in regard to its competitors—the endowment per student is not as high as it is at Williams and other schools. One very important goal for the future, that the Bennet administration has made very good progress on that needs to be continued and accelerated, is to bring more resources to the University. A key metric for me will be successful fundraising. I think we talked last time about doubling the endowment. It seems like a good goal to have. I don’t know how much time it will take to do that, but in the first year I’ll know how much time. We should double the endowment, and part of that will be from intelligent use of the resources, and part of it will be from bringing new resources, a combination of those.  One of the really important aspects of that is that it will allow us to provide more access to people. I think one of the things that I didn’t make clear in my remarks yesterday—I listened to them last night—is exactly where would equality come out in policies. I think access to Wesleyan and access to universities like Wesleyan is a really important issue in the United States and internationally. A university like Wesleyan can’t be a place for only rich people. Need-blind admissions is really very important, but nonetheless the preparation you need to be successful in the admissions process is clearly very biased by class, at least—other things too, but class plays a big role. To have a university like Wesleyan make the contribution to opening up this dream of great education to more talented people who don’t have the advantages of education earlier on—that’s the question. I don’t have the answer yet. And I don’t think Wesleyan can do it alone, but I do think Wesleyan should be a leader in this area, and Wesleyan should work with other institutions to create avenues for success for people—whether it’s for middle school or high school —to give them the preparation so they can go to an elite university—that could be Wesleyan, Harvard, oh, Williams wouldn’t count—kidding!—but, you know, to play a role [in] making education function not just as a way of supporting privilege but as a way of giving access to the kinds of values I talked about yesterday. Bringing resources is going to be important to do that—you need money to do that. You’re not going to take it out of the current program, that’s impossible.  Another measure will be who wants to come to Wesleyan. I want the applicant pool to continue to grow. It grows nicely. We have incredibly great applicants. I looked at the profile of the class coming in—it’s incredibly impressive. Let’s take the things we like the most of the applicant pool and let’s say, “How do we improve those things by five percent to seven percent per year?” Make it really hard, actually—it’s a tough goal to reach. The demographics are going to flip soon. Right now you don’t have to be a genius to get more applications because more people are at that age, but in a few years that will change. So how does Wesleyan know people are finding out how great the place is? More people want to come here. More people, not just in Boston, New York, and this corridor, but in San Antonio, Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco—they say, “Oh, Wesleyan, that’s the hot school, that’s the place. I want to go here.” You know that not just from a newspaper article or something, but from how many qualified people are trying to get in. I’m not trying to expand the size of the student body, [but] it’s a good way of seeing how the message is getting out in the world. And the more the message gets out in the world, the better it is not only for the metrics, but for the people with a Wesleyan diploma, because people just value it more and more in the world. It’s already valued very highly, of course, but more and more people will value it very highly. People who know about education know about Wesleyan, but that’s only one group of people. As you move toward the Midwest and the West, the school is not as well-known as it should be, and certainly there’s been progress there—more applications from California and elsewhere. That can accelerate. What is the level of student satisfaction? That’s a metric that’s very important. I’m not sure what the best tool for measuring that is yet. Retention is very high, but Wesleyan is in a way beyond retention. You don’t just want to retain people, you want them enthusiastic and excited about being here. How you measure that—it’s harder to measure, but we’ll figure out some way to measure that. Faculty engagement and satisfaction. Are you able to hire the very best people? When you do a search, do you get the first choice? I think we do most of the time—I can find out what the number is, but we obviously have to be even better. We’re not so close to perfect that we can’t be better in that. But how do you retain people, how do you reward them for the great work they do? That’s another metric.  Those would be some of the more easily measurable things. The partnership with the city, the role in politics, is harder to measure. I do think there you get to issues of identifying stakeholders—people whose opinion about the place you care about—and somebody other than the president will find out: how do they think we’re doing? Don’t ask Roth’s mother how he’s doing, ask the mayor of Middletown, or the senator, or people who are running the community health center. Once you identify that constituency pool, you identify people whose thoughtful evaluation of performance you take into account. So those are some of them.  EL: So there’s a popular sentiment on campus that Wesleyan every year is getting less “weird”—the key word. For some reason the students have this image of the ’70s, when you were here, as the weird time, that Wesleyan was at its weird peak. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how Wesleyan was “weird” or how this label to some extent got put on Wesleyan? MR: (Laughs) I don’t know. That’s a good question. I didn’t think we were weird. I’ve heard this—I don’t know how popular it is. American education has gotten more corporatized—it’s not just Wesleyan, look at the country. But at the same time, there’s a kind of not just tolerance but an acceptance of diversity and of self-expression and experimentation that now—it’s taken for granted at Wesleyan. It wasn’t like that in the ’70s. It may have felt weird to people [then] because people were more likely to have led sheltered lives before they came here and be surprised by differences in sexual lifestyles or identity or politics or other things.  I think now people perhaps just take a lot for granted in terms of the embrace of difference within a community. Last night after the student reception, I was invited to dinner at Open House—I didn’t know what that was. I think it’s great. I don’t know that when I was a student that that would have happened with the president. I think it might just not have happened. And so that’s a good thing. The fact that it’s not weird that they asked, or that someone said, “Ooh, that’s weird,” or something. I think that’s good, actually. “Yeah, I’d love to go to dinner there, let’s talk about this or that.” It would be a mistake to put too much of an emphasis on idiosyncrasy—to search out idiosyncrasy for the sake of idiosyncrasy—that seems kind of childish to me, actually. Sometimes there are real principles at stake, and you want to make sure that people have a certain level of freedom and have a certain level of respect, and those are really important issues. But to test those standards for the heck of it—that seems to me not very interesting. There are real issues out there that people violently disagree with off campus—starting with affirmative action, or the war, or any number of issues—take the politics where it matters, I would think. And Wesleyan could be the place where you get the tools to do that, or to learn about it, to have good arguments—not just good arguments for people with like beliefs, but how do you have a good argument or a reasonable conversation with someone who doesn’t share your views? That’s different from trying to get someone who shares most of your views to go on the edge because you say something so upsetting that even they can’t accept it—that seems puerile. So, “Keep Wesleyan Weird?”  I think that Wesleyan has been for a long time a place of serious experimentation—that’s different, I think, from what I’ve just described as childish—serious experimentation, where people are passionately devoted to exploring new territory—and the place where it comes out most importantly is in their work. They’ve thought about stuff in ways no one else has thought about it. And the teacher turns to the student and says, “You talk about this. Let’s read your poem. Because you’re doing stuff I haven’t thought of.” That happens at Wesleyan. Or you do an experiment that creates new knowledge, or you put on a theatrical production that moves people so tremendously that they are stunned. That happens at Wesleyan. That’s experimentation.  Is it weird? Yeah, it’s weird, but it’s not pursuing the bizarre, it’s creating the new. So everything I can do to help students and faculty create the new, sometimes through exploring very old things, I really want to do—but the culture of shock, or of testing, I think it’s a bit of disservice actually to the culture of serious experimentation that Wesleyan has been known for. I mean, “serious” seems like a stodgy word. Norman Brown was here in the ’50s, and Carl Shorske and Bucky Fuller, John Cage—talk about weird, right? but they were pioneers. They were changing the way people felt about education, sexuality, culture, music, and silence—they were breaking barriers, and working very hard to do it—joyously, it wasn’t just testing. GD: What’s the thing you think you know the least about, or the thing you want to learn the most about?  MR: (Laughs) There are so many. It’s hard to just say one. I guess the one at the top of my list right now is the sciences and the science building, because it’s a very important issue for the institution going forward. I’m really looking forward to learning more about scientific practice as it is now taking place and how people imagine it will be taking place 10 years from now, because I just don’t know that much about it, and as a cultural historian, I should know more about that, and it’s a really important part of understanding the world and at Wesleyan. It’s a really good thing to learn more about it, and I’ve asked the provost to send me things—research papers and articles. I love being a student, as you can tell, and this is my way of going back to school in the sciences. That’s really on the academic front.  And then—I always talk in threes—on the student side, I really want to understand why students come to Wesleyan today, what is the draw today, and what is it that makes Wesleyan compelling to somebody before they come and how they experience the school in relation to their expectations. And that’ll just be going to the dorms, or the houses, and listening to students talk about their expectations and experience—that will be fascinating for me. I could see the enthusiasm of people for the place yesterday, and now I want to find out what’s the content of that. And then the third one would be the relationship of the campus to the city, the region, and the state. Just getting a handle on that will be important to me as someone leading an institution that can make a real difference in the city and the region."

		"title": "Roth returns: Community welcomes alumnus as President",
		"date": "2007-05-01",
		"authors": "by Lindsay Ceballos, Staff Writer",
		"content": "Last Friday, students, faculty, staff, community members and administrators crowded the pews of Memorial Chapel to hear President-elect Michael S. Roth ’78 address the campus community. In an improvised speech, Roth stressed what will be three tenets of his presidency: freedom, equality, and solidarity. “I’m a historian, I’m a French historian,” Roth said. “You’ll recognize where I’m getting these things.” Chairman of the Board of Trustees Jim Dresser ’63 introduced Roth, describing the process of his selection and enumerating his credentials.   “He [Roth] embodies the qualities of leadership we seek to develop in our students, and his career reflects the sort of innovation and achievement we intend to maintain and even accelerate at Wesleyan in the years ahead,” Dresser said.  Dresser linked Roth’s commitment to liberal learning and innovation to past presidents in Wesleyan’s history, including Wilbur Fisk and Victor Butterfield. “Michael’s strengths as an institutional builder echo and complement Colin Campbell and Doug Bennet,” he said. “We look forward with excitement and anticipation as we welcome a new leader for the next chapter in the history of this great institution.” Assuming the podium to a standing ovation, Roth articulated his vision for Wesleyan’s future as a leader in the arts and sciences, as well as a promoter of equal opportunity for students. “Freedom—what does freedom have to do with a liberal arts education?” Roth said. “What I discovered at Wesleyan—it really changed my life—was that one can be free while one is working. In fact, what I learned from my teachers was that there was a great body of thought given to how you achieve freedom when you’re doing this most human thing: working, creating, building.” Roth said that work and intellectual engagement facilitate the cultivation of critical skills that students can apply toward a greater good. “That pursuit of excellence through hard work and serious intellectual endeavor together with freedom was a promise you could as a student learn how to work in such a way that after graduation you had a shot at working in our society,” he said. Roth’s second tenet, equality, draws a fine line between promoting diversity and demanding high academic quality in students. These two things do not have to be mutually exclusive, Roth argued. “Equality is a harder concept to connect with an elite institution like ours,” Roth noted. “How do we make an institution dedicated to doing the very best work possible in some very difficult fields that require enormous preparation? How do we combine that search for, demand for, excellence with a commitment to equality?” Consistent throughout Roth’s address was a high standard for Wesleyan’s future with the hope that Wesleyan will become exemplary of high academic and social integrity in higher education. His plans for Wesleyan were anchored by the third tenet of his speech: solidarity. “How do you find a way despite our differences, despite our passionate disagreements, how do you find a way to promote community and solidarity?” Roth asked. Roth commended Bennet’s administration for its pursuit of solidarity among the student body and the campus community as a whole.  “It is something that we can teach the rest of higher education, that we can be an example of for the world,” Roth said. “We can be a place that teaches freedom, that values equality and diversity, and that manifests at every turn a real desire for solidarity and community.”  Roth’s speech ended with another standing ovation as Bennet took the podium, clapping heartily, to present a gift to Roth of an image of College Row from the early 1900s and to make concluding remarks. “I am thrilled to know that this institution that I love so much will be in such capable hands,” Bennet said.  Roth and his family, Doug and Midge Bennet, and the Search Committee remained on the stage to greet members of the audience as they moved to the Zelnick Pavilion for refreshments.  Students present at the speech expressed optimistic sentiments and a desire to see if Roth’s ambitions would pan out in the years to come. “I’m really glad that he’s optimistic and seems to be willing to engage this institution at its academic roots and its community roots. My only concern is that he may be taking that solidarity for granted and I hope he’s committed to fostering that commitment,” Gavin Robb ’07 reflected after the speech. “I’m very excited. I was very impressed by his eloquence today. He’s very thoughtful and articulate and he has been through the whole search process,” remarked Professor of Russian Language and Literature Susanne Fusso, who served on the Presidential Search Committee. The speech in the chapel was only one of several events Roth attended while visiting campus last weekend. On Saturday, Roth met with student representatives from various academic departments and spoke about his own experiences as a Wesleyan student in the McKelvey Room of the Admissions building. “Don’t just think about it,” Roth remarked on what Wesleyan students could do with their education. “See if your smarts could actually change something in Middletown, could actually stop a war, could actually change the way you think about something.” Roth’s experience at Wesleyan as a student in the 1970s, much like that of today’s students, included its share of both intellectual rigor and political activism. When asked if he knew where the president’s office was, Roth gave a tongue-in-cheek response.  “Yeah, I slept there when we occupied it,” Roth remembered, referring to a 1977 student protest against companies invested in South Africa during apartheid. “That wasn’t an invitation.”  Whatever future the Roth Administration has in store for Wesleyan, there was undoubtedly a buzz of excitement and enthusiasm this weekend as the Wesleyan community met their new president—a sentiment possibly captured by Bennet’s concluding remark. “I feel so happy,” Bennet said."

		"title": "Assaults raise PSafe vigilance",
		"date": "2007-09-18",
		"authors": "by StarRose Keyes-Lebergott, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "Two assaults against Univeristy students last Saturday morning have led to increased action by both Public Safety and the Middletown Police Department. The incidents have highlighted the sometimes delicate relationship between students and Middletown residents.   “This is not the first time we’ve had incidents like this,” said Director of Public Safety David Meyer.  However, Meyer also admitted that he is “concerned that we’ve had this number [of assaults] in this short amount of time.” According to Meyer, the first incident, which occurred shortly after midnight on Church Street, was a verbal confrontation between a group of approximately 15 to 20 high school students and a group of Wesleyan students.   Christopher Alvanos ’11 witnessed the altercation. “[The two groups were] yelling obscenities at each other, and a couple of people from the group of high school students had to hold their friends back,” Alvanos said.  \t During the second assault, which took place only an hour later in front of the HiRise buildings, “several punches” were thrown by a group of high school students, according to Meyer.  Although two Wesleyan students received cuts and bruises, neither wished to receive medical attention.   The two assaults follow less than a month after an assault of a Wesleyan student by two high school-aged boys. The incidents have motivated Meyer and Interim Dean of the College Michael Whaley to confer with the Middletown Police Department about the safety of students on campus. “This has been an ongoing discussion for us about campus security…[Meyer] is our liaison to the Middletown Police Department, and he has already been working with them on trying to identify the group of folks who were responsible for these incidents,” Whaley said.   Meyer stressed that the University maintains a productive relationship with Middletown Police Chief Lynn Baldoni.  “[Baldoni] is gathering a couple of people to see how they can be of assistance [to us] to come up with a set plan to prevent these incidents in the future,” Whaley said.   According to a Public Safety alert that was sent to the Wesleyan Community on Saturday morning, Middletown Police and Wesleyan Public Safety increased patrols of the campus after the assaults. Despite these cautionary measures, Meyer claimed that relations between the Middletown community and Wesleyan students should not be considered more strained because of the recent assaults.   “I think for the most part [the relationship] is very positive, and you can’t let a couple of incidents tarnish that,” Meyer said. While Meyer said that he couldn’t speculate as to why the high school students targeted Wesleyan students in particular, Richard Meyst, a Middletown resident for 22 years, commented on the feelings of resentment that some of the Middletown community has towards Wesleyan students.   “There is arrogance from most Wesleyan students because Wesleyan is considered a ‘rich kid’ school,” he said.  Nevertheless, Meyst encouraged both Middletown residents and Wesleyan students to look beyond their preconceived notions of the other. “It’s a bad stereotype from both sides… it’s not fair to classify these kids who assaulted the students as ‘townies,’” he said.  Similarly, Meyer feels that passing judgment on the Middletown community based on two isolated assaults is uncalled for.   “A lot of people in Middletown appreciate Wesleyan students,” Meyer said. “I’d hate to label this as a bad town-gown relationship because of a few incidents.” For now, Meyer urges students to be alert. “Be aware that these things happen, and be aware of your surroundings,” he said."

		"date": "2007-11-06",
		"authors": "by Yael Tarshish, Virginia Weihs, On behalf of Earth House",
		"content": "Although we depend on Appalachia for our energy, we often remain incognizant of this region and the devastating environmental and social consequences it suffers and has suffered from decades of coal mining.  Today over three million people live within one mile of abandoned mine land, where the majority not only experience great poverty, but also face water contamination in the form of acid mine drainage (AMD) and poisonous sewage discharges.  The issue of global warming has finally begun to command widespread attention from people concerned about the future of human and ecological communities, but it is also important to recognize that communities right now, in this country, have already long borne the costs of the energy production that powers our lives.  Want to learn more and what can be done to help?  Come to the lecture “Coal, Collaboration, and Community: Trans-Disciplinary Environmental Action,” given by Dr. T. Allan Comp on Tuesday Nov. 6th, at 7:30 pm, in the Daniel Family Commons in Usdan.  Dr. Comp is a historian, an artist, a community organizer and a government bureaucrat, too. He is the founder of the coal site reclamation and water remediation project  AMD&ART, which is “one effort to confront this legacy [of coal production]…[via] a model of holistic renewal that brings the perspective of history to mix with the discipline of science, the delight of innovative design, and the energy of community engagement” (Comp, www.amdandart.org). Winner of multiple awards in partnerships and planning, Dr. Comp now directs the Appalachian Coal Country Watershed Team and does other coal related environmental remediation and community revitalization work throughout the country. This lecture is made possible by The Robert Schumann Lecture Series in The Environmental Studies Certificate Program and Earth House.  Hope to see you there!"

		"title": "634 for O’Rourke’s?",
		"date": "2008-02-08",
		"authors": "by ,",
		"content": "Beloved diner O’Rourke’s will be reopening on February 11th, partly due to extensive fundraising efforts by Middletown residents, Wes alumni, University administrators and current students. The effort to rebuild the historical diner is a model for how town-gown relationships should be, in which past divisions are put aside in favor of working for a common good (in this case, the common good involving hash browns and pancakes that all can enjoy). As any student who’s ever shame-facedly crossed Broad Street to avoid walking in front of Traverse Square could testify, there’s no denying the tension between Wesleyan’s “ivory towers” and Middletown’s North End. When students head back to O’Rourke’s to enjoy an alternative to Usdan’s brunch, in between bites of scrambled eggs they should question why O’Rourke’s functions as a safe space for students, unlike other Middletown locales such as, say, the Red Dog Saloon, the roller-rink or even the local bus station, which don’t see the same rate of student use. As the recent initiative to install security cameras around campus shows, safety is undeniably a psychological barrier in the University’s dealings with Middletown. The coalition that came together to rebuild O’Rourke’s, however, is an inspiring example of town-gown collaboration across barriers. It is most definitely a reminder that the University has a responsibility to instill in students a sense of obligation when it comes to engaging outside the “ivory towers.” Students should also take inspiration from the fact that youth turnout most definitely contributed to Senator Obama winning the Connecticut primary. According to the Middletown voting registrar, 634 students registered as Democrats in order for their vote to count on Super Tuesday. What if 634 students spent two days a week volunteering at the Green Streets Arts Center? Or what if 634 students turned out for local Middletown elections, not just for national elections? If 634 can demonstrate such enthusiasm for  Obama or Clinton, we hope that 634 can also find a way of demonstrating such enthusiasm for even more community building between the University and Middletown."

		"title": "Point/Counterpoint",
		"date": "2008-03-04",
		"authors": "by ,",
		"content": "Culled from 47 faculty and administration proposals, the five initiatives recently presented by President Michael Roth offer a wide swath of ideas on academic, extracurricular, and admissions changes within the University. We applaud Roth for drawing upon the faculty’s experience and insight when attempting to determine new policy. While recognizing that many of these initiatives remain in the planning stages, however, we cannot help but temper praise with frustration over each of the initiative’s often amorphous and ill-defined nature.  1. Strengthening the University Experience: Greater encouragement for seniors to undertake “capstone” projects may convince certain departments to broaden opportunities for those who wish to complete something other than traditional senior theses. Mandating a common class for all first year students, though, would likely result in a superficial academic experience, and seemingly contradict the University’s insistence upon flexible curriculum. 2. Internationalization: Efforts to double recruitment of international students underline the key role they play in the Wesleyan community, but the University should remember that geographic diversity also extends to underrepresented areas of the United States. As for improvements within the Office of International Studies, numerous complaints regarding credit transfers point to an issue in need of immediate attention. 3. Creative Campus: The proposed expansion of writing opportunities within the University (more courses, a potential writing certificate program) reflects a positive response to student demands. Overall, though, the initiative neglects to illustrate how the University plans to foster creativity within other majors. 4. College of the Environment: Increased attention to environmental issues are not unwelcome, but we fail to see how this proposed interdisciplinary program (modeled after the College of Letters and the College of Social Sciences) would substantially differ from pre-existing programs like the Science in Society or the Environmental Studies Certificate programs.   5. Civic Engagement: This proposal’s focus on encouraging community partnerships appears well intentioned. When over 60 percent of the student body participates in some form of community service, though, how much do we really need the administration’s encouragement? We anticipate and expect more details from the administration regarding these initiatives in the coming months. If not, the time and effort put forth by consulted faculty members will have resulted in little more than high-minded rhetoric."

		"title": "Creative campus: Roth, faculty plan enhanced curriculum",
		"date": "2008-03-04",
		"authors": "by Brooke Olaussen, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "After reviewing faculty input on various aspects of the University, President Michael Roth has outlined five broad initiatives forming a list of the University’s priorities: strengthening the undergraduate experience, internationalization, the “creative campus,” College of the Environment and civic engagement. In October, Roth invited faculty members to submit two-page proposals addressing any aspect of the University’s educational experience. Faculty members submitted a total of 47 proposals—many of which were written by several professors or entire departments. Most of the proposals focus on developing and expanding curriculum.  The main thrusts of the first initiative, strengthening the undergraduate experience, include hiring more professors, creating a more concrete first year program and encouraging all students to do some type of last year project that would function as a “capstone experience.”   The particular components of this plan have yet to be decided upon. One possibility is to broaden first year initiative courses to include a required freshman course, the goal being to give more shape to the first year experience at the University. Roth would also like to see each student do some sort of senior thesis or project.  “Many students do this already but we haven’t successfully described this experience and tied it together in a coherent way,” said Roth.  According to Roth, this means broadening the idea of a written senior thesis to whatever could be creatively integrated into the student’s particular discipline.  The second area of focus looks to change the way the University approaches international studies. Referred to as “a stool with three legs,” this initiative looks to globalize the curriculum, double the number of international students, and strengthen study abroad programs. A Middle East Studies Program is in the works.  Roth also says that he would like to see more languages taught here. Parts of this language initiative will be implemented as part of the Summer Language Institute.  “Creative campus,” another initiative, will be an effort to expand students’ creative work to all areas of campus, from arts departments to molecular biology. Roth would like to see students exploring creativity through experimentation that would serve their respective disciplines.  “Wesleyan has an edgy, creative, experimental, risk-taking student body,” Roth said.  He feels, however, that the creative work produced is not consistent across the university, and would like to make it easier for students to be creative in their field of study. As part of fostering a more creative campus, Roth wants more art courses and an expanded writing program. The new writing program is likely to include a writing certificate program, possibly a writing major in English, more writing courses and writers on campus, a Writers’ House that coordinates events with the Writing Program’s Distinguished Writers series and an expanded Wesleyan Writers Conference. “President Roth has expressed his strong interest in Wesleyan’s writing programs,” said Director of Writing Programs Anne Greene. “The particular configuration of the new programs is being discussed.” The idea of the Writers’ House is to have a center for student writers that will involve them closely in writing activities and writers’ visits. Within a year, the Writers’ House may also include a student residence and coffee house. The non-resident house programs will begin next year, using the Russell House as a center.  New writing tutorials are being planned, as are other workshops and special events for students. Greene is now asking each guest writer who visits the University to compile a reading list of books for students who are interested in training themselves as writers. These reading lists will be used in new student-run writing tutorials. Alex Ross, the well-known blogger and music critic for the New York Times, is coming this Wednesday and will be preparing the first booklist. Also being considered is a graduate studies program in writing as well as a screenwriting program.  The fourth initiative is the College of the Environment, which will be an enhanced environmental studies program modeled off of the College of Social Sciences and College of Letters.  “[The goal is to] graduate students who are conversant in environmental issues,” said Professor of Earth and Environmental Studies Barry Chernoff, who authored the proposal for the College of the Environment. “We have to understand better our relationship to the environment in a deep and scholarly way. If it comes to pass, the program will work to graduate citizens to change the fabric of life for the country.” The environmental studies major would be the second component of  the  major. The senior “capstone experience” would integrate environmental studies into whatever is appropriate in the student’s primary field of study.  “Environmental issues by their nature are multi-disciplinary,” Chernoff said. “It’s so central to campus, environmental studies in a sense belongs on Andrus Field.” As with the other initiatives, the time frame for this program is still uncertain. An enhanced commitment to civic engagement is the last of the five categories outlined in the plan. Focusing on “action and study,” Roth would like to bring programs like the Green Street Art Center, Traverse Square and WesPREP together in a coherent form and facilitate monetary donations to these programs.  “I’d really like every student to have the possibility of some dimension of civic engagement in their Wesleyan education,” Roth said.  Professors were pleased with Roth’s openness to their ideas and criticisms.  “It is a way of honoring a faculty to ask their opinion of what direction should the university go,” said Professor of American Studies Claire Potter. “It speaks well of a president when he begins his work at the institution by doing this.” After all of the proposals were submitted, faculty, administration and senior Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) representatives convened to discuss, rank and roughly group the proposals. Since not all of the proposals can be implemented, they tried to look for  themes that could be developed into areas of focus. Proposals called for earlier academic commitment or major declaration, more COL and CSS-like programs and more graduate studies programs (in areas such as writing and film, for example). A proposal for a medical school at Long Lane was even considered. Other proposals include creating a digital library and a racial and ethnic-directed studies concentration for freshmen and sophomores.  Students were also impressed by the initiatives. “The mere fact that he recognizes activism and creativity at Wesleyan is enough for me,” said WSA member Alex Levy ’08 said. “I appreciate that. It’s unrealistic to expect sweeping changes. In six months Roth has done a lot.”  In his hopes to engage all members of the University community with these initiatives, Roth will soon be inviting both students and alumni to share their ideas for the University."

		"title": "University appoints new VP for Diversity",
		"date": "2008-05-02",
		"authors": "by Rob Wohl, Staff Writer",
		"content": "Beginning this summer, President Michael Roth will be joined by another veteran of the California College of the Arts (CCA): Sonia BasSheva Mañjon. Dr. Mañjon will become the University’s first Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships. “I was impressed by Wesleyan’s history of diversity and the enthusiasm on the part of the students and faculty for civic engagement,” Mañjon said.  The Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships is a newly created position that will replace the Secretary of the University. The current Secretary of the University, Peter Patton, will continue in his other position as a professor of Earth & Environmental Sciences.  According to a University press release, Mañjon was hired to provide “leadership on civic engagement and cooperation with public and private organizations” and to “work with Wesleyan’s leadership team to attract, retain and inspire students, faculty and staff from groups currently under-represented on campus.” Mañjon will direct the University’s projects in the Middletown community, including the Green Street Arts Center and the Center for Community Partnerships. She will also act as the Affirmative Action Officer, oversee Public Safety and serve as a member of the president’s cabinet.  There will be some reorganization of the administration accompanying Mañjon’s arrival, but administrators indicate that, for the most part, staff will be moved into positions that are currently open. “It’s not like North College is changing dramatically,” said Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley. A committee was recently formed to assess and potentially reform student services. The committee, which includes Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Joe Bruno and Whaley will continue to meet over the summer. Other administrative changes will be announced by Whaley in the coming weeks. Mañjon was first introduced to the University when she attended President Roth’s inauguration in November. She will join the University’s administration on July 1. At CCA, Mañjon was the director of the Center for Art in Public Life and the co-chair of the College’s diversity initiatives. She characterizes the Center as similar to a combination of the University’s Green Street Arts Center and the Center for Community Partnerships. Mañjon also chaired the Diversity Studies Program and created the nation’s first BFA program in community arts. “Students look at how they as artists can make changes in society, specifically in social justice and diversity issues,” Mañjon said, explaining the community arts program.  She says this degree was created in response to a demand from students. So far the program has five graduates. However, Mañjon presently has no plans to create a similar program here at the University. “There’s a lot happening at Wesleyan already,” she said. “I’ll be meeting with various groups, including students, before I start trying to make changes to your environment.” Roth was the president of CCA while Mañjon was developing her program, and the two worked together throughout their tenure at CCA. Roth appointed Mañjon as soon as the position became open. No other candidates were considered for the position. “I am delighted to have Sonia join our efforts at Wesleyan,” Roth said in the University’s press release. “She is a tireless innovator with a very sophisticated sense of how to nurture existing relationships and create new partnerships with communities and constituencies of all sorts.”"

		"title": "Roth reaches out in first year",
		"date": "2008-05-06",
		"authors": "by Hilary Moss, Editor-in-chief",
		"content": "In his first year as the University’s sixteenth president, Michael Roth invigorated the Wesleyan community with a series of new initiatives, while simultaneously becoming reacquainted with his alma mater that he left 30 years ago.  “I think the most important thing I had to do this year was to get to know the Wesleyan community, and so I spent a lot of time listening to students, faculty, staff, alumni and parents, about their perception of Wesleyan today and their hopes for Wesleyan in the future,” he said. “I’ve probably had hundreds of meetings…all over the country to learn about where Wesleyan is now and what its greatest challenges are and where the opportunities lie.” One of Roth’s chief achievements was reviewing faculty input to create a series of five themes that will be implemented in the fall: strengthening the undergraduate experience, internationalization, the “creative campus,” College of the Environment and civic engagement. For the last few weeks, faculty and staff have been meeting on five committees addressing each of the topics. “They’ve all been working on identifying proposals and establishing a framework for budget planning, so by commencement I think we’ll have reports from each of these groups,” Roth explained. “University strategic planning can often take years. We tried to do it in a more focused, quicker way, and I’m delighted it’s gone as well as it has.” Roth said that he also hopes to enhance the co-curricular components of student life. Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley and Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Joe Bruno have been discussing ways to connect academics with activities outside of the classroom. “It has been stimulating to work with [Roth] because he has a range of ideas, but is very willing to listen to the ideas of others,” Bruno said. “He also applies a healthy skepticism to conversations of this type, because he wants to understand proposals fully and to know that the speaker has thought carefully about his or her ideas.” In perhaps what is his most significant initiative, Roth announced in November that beginning with the class of 2012, first-year students whose total family income is less than $40,000 per year will receive grants as opposed to loans. All other students on financial aid will graduate with a four-year total loan indebtedness reduced by an average of 35 percent. This will cost the university $3.2 million each year. According to Roth, more students are matriculating who need financial aid.  “In a sense, that’s good because they see Wesleyan as giving robust financial aid and that’s what we were hoping for,” he said. “Fundraising for it is coming along nicely, but there’s a lot more to do. For a school with our size endowment, in order to do that kind of financial aid, we really need to continue to grow our endowment so we can continue giving to students in the future.” Director of Financial Aid Jennifer Lawton said that Roth’s new loan initiative has received strong support from alums, the Board of Trustees and donors. “The hope is to reduce packaged loan debt even more in the future and with the interest shown by donors, I think this will become a reality,” she said.  Roth has also focused his energies on fundraising, especially for the endowment. “With turmoil in financial markets it’s been a difficult year for a lot of people,” he said. “I think the plan from the Board [of Trustee]’s perspective was that in the first year of a president’s tenure you don’t want to have to depend on the president to raise a lot of money from big donors. After all, he or she doesn’t know them yet, but in this case we had to raise money because we needed it for both financial aid and for the facilities projects.” He said that so far the University has received several million-dollar gifts from first-time donors, although the total amount made through fundraising cannot be reported until the end of the fiscal year.  A bulk of the fundraising money will also go to the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, to be housed in the former Davision Campus Center building and slated to open in the fall of 2009, and the new Molecular Life and Sciences complex, which is tentatively projected for completion in 2015. As part of watching the University’s cash flow, Roth also asked each of his administrative officials to cut his or her department’s budget. “I think when you spend money it should be very clearly connected to education and the further away it gets from education, teaching and scholarship, the harder it is to justify the expenditure,” Roth said. “I asked each cabinet member to reduce the budget in their area. We didn’t make all of the cuts. We want to make the ones that don’t have an impact on education.” Wesleyan Student Assembly President Matt Ball ’08 thinks Roth has also made an impact by increasing the visibility of the president on campus. “Students have a personal relationship with him and feel like they can relate to him in a way that’s quite rare on college campuses,” Ball said. “There are obviously other more concrete things, but to me his most notable achievement is his responsiveness.” Roth noted that although he travels during the weekends, he typically spends a lot of time on campus.  “Going to lots of stuff on campus has been exciting,” he said. “I’m just trying to be more open through office hours and the blog, answering e-mails and meeting people outside of office hours. I want to give Wesleyan students the feeling that they can talk to the president about issues that matter to them.” Roth could also be seen in the classroom this year as the professor of a Film Studies’ course “The Past on Film.” “Teaching has been a delight,” he said. “I’ve enjoyed it tremendously.” Next year, Roth will continue to keep his office door open, garnering more input from members of the University community. He also hopes to become a better communicator. “Sometimes I speak informally,” he said. “I suppose I should be more prudent.” Vice President and Secretary of the University Peter Patton expressed that it is important to remember that it is Roth’s first year in the position. “He’s going to be a great Wesleyan president…I think he’s accessible and willing to engage in conversation with everybody about everything,” Patton said. “He is passionate about Wesleyan and its mission and he’s just getting started. It takes a while to get under way here. His major accomplishments will be in upcoming years.“"

		"title": "Asian American Studies falls under ‘Internationalization’",
		"date": "2008-05-06",
		"authors": "by Melanie Cherng,",
		"content": "I am writing in response to the article entitled “Roth, faculty push for Middle Eastern studies in new initiatives,” which appeared in the March 28 issue of the Argus (Volume CXLIII, Number 35), in order to address President Roth’s interests in “[doubling] the number of international students on campus, as well as [developing] a Middle Eastern Studies Program.” These initiatives are a part of the administration’s efforts to “internationalize” Wesleyan so that students are prepared to engage in a diverse, globalized world.  I applaud the administration’s desire to enact institutional change. It is refreshing. But as the administration moves forward in the next few years in implementing initiatives that will “strengthen the undergraduate experience,” “internationalize” Wesleyan, inspire a “creative campus” and “civic engagement” (see Roth’s blog entry on Trustees and Themes for the Future), I would like to remind the University that internationalizing the Wesleyan curriculum and inspiring civic engagement in the Wesleyan student body necessitates the inclusion of Asian American Studies. As the United States becomes increasingly and inextricably linked to Asia, particularly China and India in foreign and economic relations, Asian American Studies becomes particularly relevant and essential.  A look at the current global issues affecting the United States—food shortages, oil crises, terrorism, the brain drain and outsourcing—all shape American attitudes towards Asian Americans.  If there is any doubt about this, simply remember how the American government treated Japanese Americans during World War II, attitudes during the Korean and Vietnam wars and the violence inflicted upon Arab Americans and South Asian Americans (particularly Sikhs) in the aftermath of 9/11. The simple truth is that the interactions between the U.S. and Asia abroad tellingly reflect how Asian Americans are treated at home. For example, whether an Asian American is considered American or a foreign Asian has consistently fluctuated in the past with American sentiment towards Asians abroad.  As soon as considering an Asian American as a foreigner becomes a possibility, the revoking of fundamental rights guaranteed to any U.S. citizen may follow dangerously at its heels. If the concerns, histories and cultures of Asian Americans were not the concerns of the rest of the American community before, they should be now. As Americans, it is our civic duty and responsibility to be well-informed and concerned about the treatment of fellow U.S. citizens.  As an educational institution that prides itself in diversity and activism, the University should provide the time, space and resources for the student to become well-informed about all communities in the United States, including the Asian American community. Not only should the University institutionalize Asian American studies because of the undeniable contribution Asian Americans have made to U.S. history, but also because the understanding of Asian American political history and culture is fundamental to preventing policy and legislation that will negatively impact the quality of life of American citizens and residents.  Wesleyan produces bright intellectuals and social activists in every graduating class who go on to shape policy in labor, education, immigration, law, etc. In order to develop policies and services that will positively support Americans from a diverse variety of backgrounds and experiences, it is fundamental that Wesleyan students are well-informed about the histories of the communities that have shaped the U.S.—including AA communities, whose histories and experiences are a vital and essential part of American history."

		"title": "WSA gathers students in Usdan for forum on Fountain",
		"date": "2008-05-16",
		"authors": "by Mollie Laffin-RoseIsabella Vitti, Editor-in-Chief and Wespeaks Editor",
		"content": "The Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) facilitated an all-campus forum on Friday afternoon in response to the incidents of Friday morning. A large crowd of students packed the first floor of the Usdan University Center for what became an almost two-hour long conversation about what exactly took place several hours earlier. President-Elect of the WSA Mike Pernick ’10 opened the forum with a note of anger and resolve that seemed to resonate with students. “I just want to say that I’m really appalled,” he said. “I’m shocked. We never want this to happen again.” Pernick thanked the administration for its responsiveness throughout the day, including President Michael Roth, Director of Public Safety Dave Meyer and Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley. Whaley was in attendance; Meyer could not attend because of a prior engagement. Roth had held a meeting with concerned students earlier in the day in the basement of South College. “They’ve really gone out of their way to be open about this,” Pernick said. Vice President-Elect of the WSA Saul Carlin ’09 read several e-mailed statements from students who were not able to attend the forum, then Izaak Orlansky ’08, former coordinator of the WSA, opened the floor to comments and questions from students. Josh Ente ’08 spoke first, asking if there was a representative from Public Safety present who could explain the office’s policies regarding social events.  Orlansky said that although it was important to ask questions such as these to the administration, the forum was intended primarily to be a space for students’ voices. Whaley did speak several times in response to comments or questions about University policies, first offering solidarity with the student body. “I have as many questions about what happened last night as you do,” he said. “Like all of you, I’m still trying to figure it all out.” Liat Olenick ’08 inquired as to the Middletown Police Department’s (MPD) authorization to be on campus.  Whaley responded that although he agrees that the department’s presence on campus has increased over the past several years, rumors that MPD were at one time not allowed on campus are untrue. He said that MPD presence has increased in part because the University has requested more assistance after a surge in student assaults and thefts. The scene became emotional at times, as students offered testimonials of their experiences with pepper spray bullets, taser guns and interactions with police officers. Andrew Price ’09, one of five University students who was arrested, recounted being chased by an officer and canine, followed into a student house, and attacked by the dog. “It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced,” Price said. “And I don’t understand why, with 30 of his colleagues on the street, this man needed a canine to come and bite me in the head to take me into the police station.” Leslie Prado ’08 said that when she approached an officer after the pepper spray bullets had been shot to ask for an explanation, he responded by threatening, “Do you want to get arrested?” “I felt very voiceless last night,” Prado said. “I want to have a voice.” Dionne Anderson ’10 said that this was not the first instance of Public Safety Officers disrespecting students. “I’m tired of being belittled,” Anderson said. “I will not stand for it anymore. I am not a target. I’m a human being.” Ron Bernstein P’11 expressed his concerns both as a parent of a University student who was shot with pepper spray and as a lawyer who represents a major police department. “This whole group is radicalized against the police,” Bernstein said.  “That’s not what the police want.” Looking towards resolutions, students agreed that much of the problem lies in poor communication and poor town-gown relations. “The issue has always been communication,” said Jake Greenberg ’08, who suggested that the University set up different committees to gather information about yesterday’s incidents and improve dialogue with the MPD. Maya Barros-Odin ’10 encouraged the crowd to strive for a more inclusive Middletown community. “I think that certainly as a Wesleyan community we have strength,” Barros-Odin said. “But I think that we would have greater strength if we worked as a Middletown community, together.”  Mark Kelley ’08 suggested that students maintain a positive attitude during the next several weeks. “It’s important for us to act like the adults we want to be treated like,” Kelley said. “Don’t be resentful. Rise above it.” Similarly, Alex Gelman ’08 offered a positive approach to a tense situation. “I’ve honestly never been prouder to be a Wesleyan student than I am right now,” Gelman said. “[The police] dehumanized us. We have to remember that they’re people, too. We can’t take that dehumanization and that barbarity and turn that back on them. We have to respond with love.” In offering closing thoughts, both Pernick and Whaley encouraged students to e-mail first-hand accounts of the morning’s incidents to the administration and the WSA. Pernick encouraged continuing community and conversation, and Whaley promised that the administration would find answers to the many lingering questions."

		"title": "2007-2008: Know your news",
		"date": "2008-08-29",
		"authors": "by Suzanna Hirsch, News Editor",
		"content": "For those students just joining us, and for those who simply need a refresher, here’s a look back at some of the news highlights from`\t last year: * A not-so Bon Appetit: Campus optimism for new food provider Bon Appetit wavered in the early weeks of the fall semester, when members of Unite Here! Local 217, the University food service worker’s union, accused the company of violating the union’s contract. Many students expressed solidarity with the dining workers, who maintained that Bon Appetit was attempting to cut workers’ hours and benefits. Ultimately, the company and the union reached a settlement near the end of spring semester. *Usdan boycott: Riding a wave of complaints surrounding the recently-opened University Center (and perhaps feeling an accompanying nostalgia for former dining hall Mocon), about 100 students gathered in Usdan in September to stage a small-scale boycott against the new facility. Former Bon Appetit Resident District Manager Delmar Crim listened to the protesters as they voiced complaints about high food prices, long lines, and unfair treatment of workers. While many questioned the boycott’s effectiveness, Bon Appetit did implement several changes—such as the option of using meals, rather than strictly points, to pay for lunch—when spring semester rolled around. *Science Center site selection: In early October, a final location was chosen for the new $160 million Molecular and Life Sciences building. While some praised the effort to unite the sciences with the rest of campus, others mourned the imminent demolition of Shanklin Laboratory—one of the oldest buildings on campus—prompting a widely joined Facebook group, “The Save Shanklin Campaign.” *Cocktails cause chaos: The second installment of a broadly cherished campus tradition, Senior Cocktails, was cancelled after bad behavior at the first event in October. Senior fun was spoiled for all when several students verbally abused the bus driver transporting the class to the off-campus soiree. The driver was also reportedly physically assaulted, and alcohol containers and illegal drugs were also left scattered around the bus.  *Robin Williams draws laughs: 200 lucky students enjoyed an hour of comedy when Robin Williams spoke in the Memorial Chapel. Tickets for the Beta-sponsored charity event sold out a mere two hours after going on sale. *Surveillance for safety: In December, Public Safety (PSafe) proposed placing security cameras around campus to prevent theft and illegal activity. While PSafe assured students that the cameras were put in place to protect, not persecute, them, many worried they could potentially be used to catch under-aged drinkers. While some new cameras were installed on campus, the issue remains under discussion. *Diner delights: Students and Middletown natives alike enjoyed omelettes, pancakes, and other favorite dishes when O’Rourke’s Diner reopened in February. The Main Street hotspot, which had burned down a year and a half earlier, remains a cherished example of positive town-gown relations—not to mention a must-stop for delicious cuisine. *Less Times to go around: Due to WSA funding issues and increased per-paper cost, the New York Times Readership Program, which supplies the free newspapers seen around campus, seemed temporarily in jeopardy last year. While the number of papers on campus was ultimately reduced, the program remains intact, leaving readers and crossword puzzle-doers alike with an adequate Times fix. *Zonker Harris party prohibition: The end of February may have brought sun and clear skies closer in view, but it also coincided with a controversial announcement: Zonker Harris Day, a treasured WesFest weekend celebration, would go unfunded if the name was not changed. Administration expressed concern that the name—stemming from a stoner character in the famed “Doonesbury” comic strip—would inspire unwanted drug activity. Students begrudgingly obliged, and the festival remained practically unchanged under the equally witty title, ’Ze Who Must Not Be Named Day.’” *Spring breaking for a cause: While others relaxed in beach-filled locales, about 30 University students joined forces with over 100 students nationwide to protest the War in Iraq. Eight members of the Wesleyan group, titled Our Spring Break, were arrested at the Washington D.C. march. (See article on page XX) *Surprising campus crimes: The campus community received some alarming e-mails last April, following two on-campus student muggings in a 24-hour period. Public Safety advised students on how to stay alert and collaborated with the Middletown Police Department to help the somewhat shaken campus community feel more at ease in its generally secure home. *More contract woes: Students and staff joined members of Physical Plant in a high profile campus march to draw attention to the Physical Plant workers’ contract issues. While the workers felt they were loosing money, higher-ups claimed negotiations remained unproblematic. In any case, campus dwellers soon became accustomed to hearing students and workers alike chanting “No contract, no work, no peace.” *Fountain fiasco: In an end of the year celebration gone wrong, five students were arrested when Public Safety and the Middletown Police Department began forcibly clearing Fountain Avenue of partying undergrads after repeatedly demanding students move away from the street. Charges ranged from disorderly conduct and assault on a police officer to inciting a riot, while police drew criticism for using pepper spray, dogs, and taser guns on the crowd. *Barack rocked commencement: When the tragic news of Senator Ted Kennedy’s brain tumor was released, seniors were left not only saddened by the senator’s illness, but also without a commencement speaker. Just days before commencement was scheduled to occur, however, students received word that they would be getting a high profile replacement. As they walked down the aisle, graduates were greeted not only by President Roth, but by now-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama."

		"title": "ODC/Dance performs and teaches while on campus",
		"date": "2008-09-05",
		"authors": "by Benjamin Firke, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "A woman lies crumpled on the floor in her best evening gown. A man stands over her. He tries to lift her up in his arms, but she twists out of his grasp and falls to the ground. The man tries to lift her again, but she eludes his grasp for a second time, dancing away into a corner. He removes his tie and lunges for her. This time, the woman rolls away from her pursuant and watches, smirking, as he drops to the floor; he is now the one lying prostrate.  What is the scene? A dinner party gone horribly wrong? No—Anne Zivolich and Brandon “Private” Freeman (a former Army National Guard officer) are performing with ODC/Dance at the CFA Theatre. “Private” is not a typical nickname for a professional dancer, but then again, ODC/Dance is anything but a typical dance company. Founded at Oberlin College in 1971, ODC relocated to the Bay Area in 1976 and has become one of the most successful performance troupes in the region. Still artistic directed by founder Brenda Way after 37 years, the group specializes in an iconoclastic style that is both intellectual and physical. Wesleyan was lucky enough to host them for seven days this July as part of an initiative by the Center for the Arts.  ODC/Dance arrived in Middletown on July 4 for a week-long residency during which the performers worked with the Wesleyan Summer Programs’ Center for Creative Youth (CCY) in an intimate workshop setting. Photography students were allowed to bring their cameras to rehearsals and capture the movement of the dancers on film. The dance students received master classes on the same pieces that ODC performs at their theater in San Francisco. All students in the program attended a talk in which members of the company expounded on the creative process.  Finally, the residency culminated in performances on July 10-11 as ODC/Dance brought its signature hybrid of ballet and modern styles to the CFA Theater. The group presented four pieces before a highly receptive audience of CCY and other summer school students, Middletown residents and local youth groups. “24 Exposures” began the evening. Way choreographed this piece to a recording composed by Edgar Myer and played by a string ensemble featuring Yo-Yo Ma. The work showcased the entire company of 10 dancers onstage against a brightly colored backdrop that changed between pink, orange and teal. The dancers wore equally colorful tights and leotards and spent the better part of 20 minutes showcasing their leaping skills in powerful yet graceful jumps.  The troupe then fractured into a series of small groups, each performing their own individual routines. The rush of color and movement in “24 Exposures” lacked the cohesion and thematic weight of the following three pieces and for all of the dancers’ effortless movement, the first routine allowed the audience to lose attention too easily.  However, the final image of the piece was breathtaking and expressed the ethos of ODC/Dance clearer than any press release: three female dancers, each held in the air in ascending order, formed a freeze-framed picture of a woman taking flight.  “Shenanigans,” choreographed by former CCY dance department chair KT Nelson, featured Zivolich and Freeman in a hormonally charged and comic piece set to a jaunty Darius Milhaud piano score. The two performed against a black backdrop amidst gold lighting, wearing formal evening wear—a tuxedo and a party dress suitable for waltzing, not a high-energy romp. But the music and costumes made for a dissonant juxtaposition with the choreography, which featured sly innuendo and floor-writhing in-between the twirls and jumps. The performers made it clear that wit, not just athleticism, is a key component of the ODC aesthetic.  For “Unintended Consequences: A Meditation,” the stage was set with grids of white fluorescent light fixtures reminiscent of the work of minimalist artist Dan Flavin. Way’s choreography was set to various songs by Laurie Anderson, including “O Superman,” a song which includes a main musical motif of the word “Ha” repeated over and over.  Though the song had little variation in dynamics, rhythm or melody, the dancers struck simple yet dynamic poses which made the song’s mournful tone all the more poignant—the sight of a figure stretching out their arms as if in flight and then crumpling to the floor conveyed a mournful commentary on the hubris of America’s foreign policy in the Middle East.  The evening concluded with Nelson’s “Walk Before Talk,” which featured eight dancers. After an hour and a half of movement the company refused to let up, and the piece had possibly the highest energy level of the night. A reverse of the reflective tone of “Unintended Consequences,” the finale proved to live up to its title.  Dressed in firey colors and set against a sunset-like backdrop, the company threw themselves about the stage in the most passionate explosion of movement that night. The performance played like a more seamless and concentrated version of “24 Exposures,” as the company used its powerful kicks and fluid arms to give the audience a final jolt.  When the performance was over, the dancers were covered in sweat. But their smart and passionate work—as well as their willingness to teach during their residency—proved that the University’s CFA is just as vibrant in the summer as during the academic year."

		"title": "Mytheos’ misrepresentation",
		"date": "2008-09-12",
		"authors": "by Freddie deBoer,",
		"content": "I’ve never felt compelled before to write in to the Argus, but I feel there are many misconceptions and half-truths in Mytheos Holt’s latest column (“Mytheology: Where is your Vanguard Now?,” September 9, 2008, Volume CXLIV, Number 3) on the incidents at Fountain Avenue that occurred last May. My father was a professor at Wesleyan for over 30 years [Professor of Theater Fredrik deBoer], and I grew up on campus, so I have some insight into both the college and the community. Holt’s portrayal of Middletown and its relationship with Wesleyan are both flatly wrong. Despite Holt’s implication that there is a contrast between liberal Wesleyan and conservative Middletown, Middletown is an extremely liberal community by any standards. Middletown is a Democratic stronghold in perhaps the bluest state in the country. Middletown was a union town before the manufacturing industry collapsed in the state, and remains a very diverse, progressive community. The town has a proud record of service to minorities and to the protection and support of artists and nonconformists, as a little basic research into the legal and municipal history of Middletown would demonstrate. Holt might also be served by doing a little research into the socioeconomic status of Middletown, which would contradict his notion that Middletown is a poor community. I take it, though, that research is not Holt’s forte. What’s more, Holt’s portrayal of the police doesn’t fit the reality. Holt says that the conflict at Fountain Avenue was really about class conflict and resentment from the “proletarian” police towards the affluent Wesleyan students. Setting aside the fact that Marxist orthodoxy would never regard police officers of any stripe as proletarian, the average Middletown Police officer earns more than the national median income. All of them have college degrees. If Holt actually got to know some of them, rather than rendering them as crude stereotypes, he would learn that very many of them are in fact liberal, and quite accepting of nonconformists. They do have uniformly low opinions of people who break the law. The fact of the matter is, Holt’s portrayal of a simmering “town versus gown” conflict is simply fantasy. I, like many Middletown residents, am indeed very often irritated by the way in which some Wesleyan students tend to view Middletown as a playground. But that is genuinely as far as this conflict is taken: irritation. Again, a little research into the history of Middletown/Wesleyan relations would show that, in context with other campus/community divides, the one between Middletown and Wesleyan is extraordinarily minor. The large majority of unrest on Wesleyan’s campus has historically been the product of students (like the 1990 firebombing of the president’s office). To be blunt, Holt dramatically misrepresents both Middletown and Wesleyan to leverage his political position. We may all be working class proles here in Middletown, but I think some of us possess education enough to identify intellectual dishonesty when we see it."

		"title": "WESU expands programming",
		"date": "2008-09-12",
		"authors": "by Ben Firke, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "If a resident of central Connecticut turned their radio to 88.1 FM, they might wonder if the Nutmeg State had suddenly transformed into an oasis of pan-cultural music without their knowledge. On Friday alone, listeners from Hartford to New Haven can tune in to a showcase of aural eclecticism: From a show hosted by and featuring creative Middletown youth to live break-beat mixing to a pair of Latin music shows, WESU radio specializes in an diverse mix of programming driven equally by University students and Middletown residents. Recently, a combination of new shows and proposals, as well as some older local initiatives that not all University students are aware of, indicate that now is an exciting time for 88.1. “The Wesleyan Report,” dubbed an “Argus for the Airwaves,” by WESU President Noah Hutton ’09, will air on Fridays from 2-3 p.m. The show will feature campus news, CFA events, sports roundups, interviews with professors and taped re-broadcasts of select on-campus lectures.  “It’ll be like a once a week podcast,” Hutton said of the show, which was designed by WESU to place more focus on current University events. Besides broadening its programming through “The Wesleyan Report” and a variety of new indie-rock programs, WESU is attempting another expansion: boosting its signal from 1500 to 6000 watts. If the station upgrades, 88.1 FM will be able to broadcast to almost all of Connecticut, not just the central region of the state. This would give WESU access to most of Connecticut’s 3.5 million residents, making it the most powerful college radio station in the state, surpassing the UConn station by 1,600 watts. Hutton made clear that the station still needs to secure funding to pay for the transmitter, but the station’s recent move to the Department for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships may positively affect the outcome. Hutton also dismissed a rumor that President Michael Roth sought to “axe” the station last academic year, attributing the shift in departments to the standard “shuffling” that occurs when a new president begins work at a college. WESU’s funding remains unchanged, and a presentation to Roth and his executive team was well received. Hutton also stressed 88.1’s often-overlooked community outreach efforts and asserted that WESU is the most Middletown-integrated organization at the University. Of the more than 100 DJ’s affiliated with the station, half are residents of Middletown. Programs such as “Jive at 5” promote town events as well as arts calendars for the entire central Connecticut region.  However, WESU’s town-gown programs include more than radio programming—they extend to several live events on Main Street. The station sponsors a monthly dance party at local dance hall Jimmy’s Jump and Jive, hiring a DJ and opening the doors to both Middletown residents and Wesleyan students. The Button Retreat, another Main Street venue, is rented seasonally for student band performances and Middletown poetry readings. Additionally, WESU sponsors a tent at the annual classic car cruise. Currently, WESU is working on more outreach to the University, with programs like “The Wesleyan Report.”  “We’ve been a part of Middletown very firmly,” Hutton said. “And we’re actually trying now to become more a part of Wesleyan.”"

		"title": "Misreading Mytheology",
		"date": "2008-09-16",
		"authors": "by Mytheos Holt,",
		"content": "Dear Mr. deBoer, Considering that you never felt compelled to write in the Argus before now, and I rarely feel compelled to respond to responses to my work, I think we’re both breaking rules here. But I do have to defend myself from your attacks that, I think, arise largely from a misreading of my argument. To begin with, I had never argued that Middletown is conservative. That would be patently absurd. I am aware, given that our representative is Rose DeLauro, that Middletown is a Democratic community. But as I think you saw in the recent primaries, Democratic voters are hardly homogenous, so that does not necessitate an attitude of beneficence toward Wesleyan students, who strike me as a distinctly different sort of liberal than the average Middletown resident.  Secondly, I never said Middletown was poor, only that it was “blue collar,” and contrary to what you may believe, I have reasons for believing that. The average yearly wage in Middletown is somewhere around $46,000. Considering that some “blue collar” jobs pay as much as $57,000, I think this is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the term “blue collar,” which is distinct from “poor.” Moreover, just because Middletown has officially protected “artists” and “minorities,” that does not mean that the town itself has a generally pleasant attitude toward nonconformity in the present day, or that this attitude spills over onto Wesleyan students (a nonconforming lot if ever there was one!).  Thirdly, you say that police officers do not despise nonconformity, but merely have “uniformly low opinions of people who break the law.” I don’t dispute that this is true of most police officers, but I find it to be completely inconsistent with the actions on Fountain Avenue, which I think only can be explained by some sort of resentment. I do not think that resentment is income-based, but culturally-based. I know that police officers do not fit a Marxist model, and that they are not poor, uneducated proles. As for casting them as crude stereotypes, I think most of the campus sees them that way after Fountain Avenue, but I do not pretend for a second that it applies to ALL Middletown police officers, which is one reason why I warned my peers that authority should be respected at times.  You also say that my “town versus gown” argument is pure fantasy, and that the conflict between Wesleyan and Middletown is “relatively minor.” You are right that, compared with students at other schools, we have it fairly good. But whatever else you think, rest assured that I have done some research into Middletown/Wesleyan relations, and I know that as recently as the nineties, some college guides (especially the Wesleyan student-produced College Prowler guide) warned students about entering Middletown alone or at night, because of the deep dislike the residents harbored for students. With respect, this hostility is obviously not gone, at the point at which it is barely two weeks into the semester and we already have suffered at least one incident where Public Safety felt compelled to send out an alarm. Perhaps irritation is as far as it goes with you, but that does NOT mean that all Middletown residents share your comparatively benevolent view of us. In fact, the evidence from last semester and this one show that many of them do not. Finally, I must assure you that I was not being intentionally intellectually dishonest, but merely describing things as I see them. My piece had two theses, and you appear to have conflated them as one. Thesis one was that Middletown shows a varying degree of hostility toward Wesleyan students, that this hostility was based on a cultural divide between student and resident, and that it appears to have impacted the judgment of the officers on Fountain Avenue. Thesis two was that well-meaning, egalitarian minded Wesleyan students are ill-equipped to deal with the reality that the disparity between class cultures is more significant than the actual income disparity that exists between classes, which is why communal economic egalitarianism will only worsen conditions by trying to force mutual coexistence across this oil-and-water culture divide. I apologize for any offense, which was purely unintentional. I would hate to contribute to the antagonism that already exists, especially given that this is a time when both Middletown and Wesleyan clearly need to let our hackles down."

		"title": "2002 incident recalls Fountain",
		"date": "2008-09-16",
		"authors": "by Jacob Kleinman, Staff Writer",
		"content": "On Sept. 8, 2002, Middletown police broke up an outdoor party on Pine Street using batons, pepperball guns, and a K-9 unit. Twelve students were arrested. “They called them the ’Pine Street Riots,’ ” said Matt Lerner ’03. “I remember it being a rowdy night.” With the release of the Fountain Report on Monday, the story of the 2002 “Pine Street Riots” is useful in examining the ups and downs of a campus trying to come to terms with a conflict that hits upon issues of class, social life, and the law. As alumni witnesses recalled the angry Wespeaks, forums, administrative responses, and the 2002 night itself, the question is begged: Why did this happen again? According to Nonie Hamilton ’03, the party started to go down hill when a fire alarm was set off. “I was at a house party turned into a street party, and the fire alarm went off,” she said. “Rather than slowly escalating, there was a huge fire department response. The [police] immediately showed up and started arresting kids, throwing them on the ground and in the back of cop cars.” Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley, who was dean of students in 2002, explained the order of events. “The police were called by the fire department, [the fire department] was having trouble getting through the crowd,” Whaley said. “Like on Fountain [in 2008], the police had to forcibly clear the crowd.” Once the police arrived, the conflict only escalated, said Lerner, who was a Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) official. “I remember we came onto a scene,” Lerner said. “There were police cars. Everything turned into a lot of chaos. Everyone was running in different directions. People yelling. Confusion. People didn’t know what was happening at the time. I was pretty upset.” Similarly to the 2008 Fountain Avenue incident, students attempted to contact University officials as the conflict unfolded. In 2002, however, Hamilton said, efforts were not as successful. President Roth arrived at the scene during last semester’s incident. “I had a dean’s home phone number,” Hamilton said. “But I don’t think she completely believed us. They didn’t send anyone down.” As with last Spring, a forum was held the next day to discuss what had happened, though there were many more University and local officials in attendance. Along with members of the Middletown police and fire departments, several WSA members—Hamilton and Joey Wender ’03 among them—spoke. At the forum for the 2008 incident, WSA President Mike Pernick ’10 spoke, but the only adult official present was Whaley. Wender, president of the WSA for the 2002-2003 academic year, felt that the forum was beneficial. “Generally, it prompted some good, healthy dialogue,” he said. “Nothing like it happened again. It stayed in the background. Chalking became a big issue not much later and held the interest of the campus.” Not all students agreed with Wender, however. In a Wespeak published on Friday, Sept. 13, 2002, David Weiner ’06 expressed unhappiness with the result of the forum. “We blew our opportunity on Tuesday night to get real answers and opinions about what happened the night of Saturday the 7th,” Wiener wrote. “ [Deputy Police Chief Phillip] Pessina came to campus, determined to give vague, unhelpful answers. He stalled, he did not directly answer a single pertinent question, circumvented and forgot to answer pieces of questions, and used the pending trials as a judicial shield.” After police broke up the Fountain Avenue party this past May, students wondered whether the Middletown Police Department had a grudge against University students. Alumni who experienced the 2002 event had mixed views of whether animosity between police and students led to that event. “I never experienced [animosity] before that night,” Hamilton said. “It seemed like there were tensions that I hadn’t really understood.” Wender felt that minimal previous interaction between University students and Middletown police led to a serious miscommunication that ultimately caused the incident.  “I would call it a lack of respect,” Wender said. “[Police and students] rarely interacted with one another, and they rarely clashed. Students were used to PSafe. Police were used to Middletown residents.” Similarly, Whaley does not believe that pre-existing town-gown divisions incited the 2002 conflict. “Some students may think there is a sustained animosity, but I don’t think that’s the case,” he said. “When the police come to campus, they’re doing the job they have to do.” Only three weeks after the “Pine Street Riots,” attention quickly shifted elsewhere as President Doug Bennet enacted a moratorium on chalking. The New York Times reported on the event and, in November, the faculty voted against the chalking moratorium. A cursory glance through The Argus archives for the rest of that semester shows little, if any, interest in the Sept. 8th conflict.  However, on October 25, 2002, it was announced that, in response to the Sept. 8 incident, Officer David Beauchemin had been selected as the liaison between the Middletown Police Department and the University. While there had been a liaison in 2001, the officer had retired and had not been replaced. Meanwhile, Whaley, was charged with investigating potential Student Judiciary Board cases that surrounded the incident.  “What I was most concerned about was finding out what happened at the [2002] incident, making sure students weren’t in violation of the non-academic code of conduct,” he said.  This time around, as a member of the Fountain Avenue Working Group, Whaley is again listening to student perspectives of the conflict. Thanks to a binder full of student eyewitness reports and video footage from Public Safety, Whaley believes that the University has a more clear-cut version of what happened in May 2008 than it did in 2002. “We can make more specific recommendations about what should happen,” he said. Whaley believes that, ultimately, the similarities between the two incidents will become evident in the Fountain report. “When the final report comes out, some of the recommendations [will be] the same we recommended after [the 2002] incident,” he said."

		"content": "After the incident last semester on Fountain Avenue, The Hartford Courant covered the event heavily, featuring a story on the front page. Rick Green, a local columnist and former Middletown resident, wrote an opinion piece that was critical of what he described as Wesleyan students’ misguided sense of activism. Having covered Middletown for The Courant in the late ’80s and early ’90’s, Green has examined the long history of the University’s town-gown relations. Argus: Was this story really front-page worthy? Rick Green: I think so. Because of the long history between the Middletown cops and Wesleyan students, and the difficulty with the neighborhood, I think it’s fair game, especially because of the reaction on all sides. The police were indignant and the students were indignant. I also think this got so much attention because of how quickly it got out of hand. A: How was covering Middletown back in the day? RG: I was in Middletown in the late ’80s and early ’90s, and there were these sorts of issues even before the firebombing thing. A: Why did you decide to enter the fray? RG: The reason I wrote about this is because of the way students got indignant about it because they felt that their civil rights got violated because they wanted to party at one in the morning. It’s not some valiant cause or something—we’re not talking about education or the poor or Iraq. It’s the right to get wasted and play music on the street. If you’ve been drinking and the cops show up and tell you to get off the street, that’s what you do. The cops come, you book—that was always my rule. A: Do you think Wesleyan has ever been an “activist” school? RG: You could argue Wesleyan has a good tradition of protest—but that’s why I saw this as a cheapening of that. A: What did you think about the crazy anonymous comment wars that this event incited? RG: That’s how I first got dragged into it. I saw the comments on The Hartford Courant website and on Wesleying, who did a good job covering this one. I assume the comments attracted Wesleyan alumni from across the country. All the comments about police brutality—I found it amusing that people were reacting like it was civil rights in 1964. A: Did you think the cops’ behavior was justified? RG: That would raise a lot of questions on my mind. I can’t defend what they did."

		"title": "WesVotes promotes student registration",
		"date": "2008-09-19",
		"authors": "by Meredith Rogerson, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "A team of students and administrators finalized plans last week to institute WesVotes, a partnership between the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) and various administrative offices aimed at aiding students in the registration and voting processes. The program, currently led by a bipartisan group of University students, represents a major step towards increasing voter turnout within the campus community. The program’s mission is two-fold: one, to raise awareness among the student body about civic engagement; and two, to facilitate both the registration and voting processes for University students. Both the Office of Residential Life (ResLife) and the Office of the University Registrar have worked closely with students to make the program a reality.  The program itself was a direct reaction to poor turnout of college-age voters in past elections, said Chris Goy ’09, former president of the Wesleyan Democrats and the main organizer of WesVotes.   “There are may people who become disenfranchised by being in college,” said Goy, who attributes this to students’ busy schedules and the fact that many of them are from out-of-state.  Goy also notes that voters between the ages of 18 and 24 make up a substantial segment of the country’s population.  “The fact that [this portion] of the population is underrepresented is shameful,” said Goy. Thanks to the Registrar’s Office, students can now find a link to DeclareYourself.org at the top of their Electronic Portfolios, where they can register to vote, request absentee ballots, and view information about voting and the election process. With the help of ResLife, students can also register to vote or obtain an absentee ballot through a WesVotes representative who lives in their residence hall. This makes the program especially helpful for students who do not wish to vote in the state of Connecticut.   “We have asked each RA to identify a Hall Captain,” said Director of Residential Life Fran Koerting in an email. “Hall Captains will discuss voter registration with their neighbors and assist each person individually to register to vote or request an absentee ballot.”  For students who will be voting in Middletown on Nov. 4, the WesVotes team has coordinated with the Office of Community Service to make both registration and voting as simple as possible.  “Students can drop off their registration cards at a designated drop box at WesStation, where we will collect them and deliver them to City Hall,” said Director of Community Service and Volunteerism Cathy Crimmins Lechowicz. “The [Center for Community Partnerships] will also provide transportation on the day of the election to transport students to their designated polling station.” She added that vans would be leaving roughly every half-hour from the Usdan University Center on Election Day. WesVotes has no plans to stop its services once the upcoming election has passed.  “The purpose is to create a system of institutionalized voter registration,” said Goy, who shares this vision of the program’s endurance with Director of Student Activities and Leadership Development Tim Shiner. Shiner, whose office has been active in the establishment of the WesVotes program, believes that it is an important addition to the Wesleyan community.  “My hope is that having a central group of students which brings together the various stakeholders will…assist in sparking greater civic engagement in the student body and the larger community,” he said. “I hope to work with the students involved from year to year to provide continuity in their efforts.” Many students agree that WesVotes is a welcome addition to the University, especially since the program caters to the student who has a full schedule and would therefore be less inclined to vote. “Almost everyone knows what’s going on in the election,” said Sam Hecht ’12. “But for most people there’s just no motivation. It would really help a lot if students could vote from their dorm rooms.”  “Wesleyan students don’t need a hand-out,” said Goy, “but they do deserve the right information.”"

		"title": "Budgetary constraints threaten NY Times readership program",
		"date": "2008-09-19",
		"authors": "by Katherine Yagle, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "Due to the recent increase in the price of the New York Time—rom 30 to 45 cents per university cop—unding for the Wesleyan Readership Program is slated to run out early next semester. The program, which was started nearly nine years ago, distributes free copies of the paper across campus Monday through Friday.  The New York Times Readership Program offers a discounted subscription to educational institutions that wish to provide copies of the paper to students. For the past few years, the Organization and External Affairs Committee (OEAC) of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) has brought 700 copies of the Times to campus five days a week at the price of 30 cents each. Annually, such distribution cost a total of $25,000, with $15,000 being paid by the WSA, $6,000 by the Office of Academic Affairs, and $4,000 by the Office of Student Affairs.  “This is a partnership between the WSA and the administration,” said WSA Vice President Saul Carlin ’09. “It benefits the entire community.” Last year, David Booth, manager of the New York Times Readership Program, alerted former WSA Vice President Emily Malkin ’08 that the price would increase to 45 cents per copy—a 50 percent increase—over two semesters. As a result, the annual cost of the program increased to $41,650.  Last semester, when the transition price of 40 cents per copy went into effect, the OEAC reduced the number of copies delivered daily to 600 in order to meet the annual $25,000 budget.  “Almost half the papers that are picked up are picked up in Exley,” Carlin said. “A lot of professors are picking these up, and a lot of professors like the idea of their students reading the New York Times every day.”  With that in mind, Malkin began reaching out to various academic departments in order to seek funding to continue the program. However, when the WSA approached the departments, the Office of Academic Affairs decided that their contribution to the program would function as an umbrella contribution from all academic departments, thus eliminating any extra funding the WSA had hoped to receive. In order to continue the program, the OEAC proposed a proportional contribution increase: the WSA, the Office of Student Affairs, and the Office of Academic Affairs would each increase their funding by 43 percent. Additionally, the students approached the Office of Admission for funding assistance. OEAC’s proposal suggested that the WSA contribute $21,500, the Office of Student Affairs contribute $5,700, the Office of Academic Affairs contribute $8,600, and the Office of Admission contribute $6,000.  Dean of Students Rick Culliton vetoed the proposed funding increase.  “We are in the midst of a five-year review of our budgets, trying to make reductions across the University,” said Culliton. “In looking at our own budgets and needing to make reductions, [the New York Times Readership Program] is a very nice thing to have on campus, but in our view it’s not something that is essential.” Dean of Admission Nancy Meislahn was unable to accept the WSA’s proposal, due to the present policy that the Office of Admission only provide funding to activities that are directly related the office, not to student activities.  “I believe that the New York Times Readership Program is a fantastic admissions tool,” Carlin said. “ I remember when I was visiting as a pre-frosh, I was on a balcony looking down on people eating and I saw half the tables with New York Times papers spread open and students reading and discussing what was going on. The WSA believes that the program is directly related to Admissions. We have prospective students coming here and seeing what I saw. The whole community benefits from this civic engagement that happens when people can pick up a copy of the New York Times, sit around a table in Usdan or in Pi, read what’s going on, and talk about it.” The OEAC currently faces a rapidly depleting fund, even with the decreased number of papers being delivered.  “It’s not that Admission didn’t want to [fund the program], it’s not that Dean Rick didn’t want to do it, it’s that the administration doesn’t want to do it. It’s that wherever we go, there seems to be an assumption that the WSA can foot the bill all on our own, and we can’t,” Carlin said.  The students are continuing to make their case to the administration and seek a proportional increase in funding.  However, unless an agreement is reached, the fund will run out sometime in early spring—effectively ending the Readership Program.  “It’s not that anyone in Student Affairs doesn’t think the program is a nice thing to have on campus,” said Culliton. “It’s just that at this point, as we look at tight budgets, it’s harder to justify that.” Carlin hopes that a sense of urgency as the deadline nears will encourage members of the Wesleyan administration to agree to funding increases.  “Holding a paper in your hands is a completely different experience than reading the news online,” he said. “To lose that experience on this campus would be a real tragedy.”"

		"content": "“All grandeur, all power, all subordination rest on the executioner. He is the horror and bond of human association; remove this incomprehensible agent from the world, and at that very instant order gives way to chaos, thrones topple and society disappears.” -Comte Joseph de Maistre It is an oft-remarked fact that Wesleyan students dislike external control. Indeed, if one looked back through the issues of this noble paper, one would probably find that the majority of angry Wespeaks are written in response to some abuse of authority, either real or imagined, whether it is perpetrated by the Wesleyan administration, the faculty, the Bon Appetit staff, Public Safety, the Middletown Police or even the laws of economics. A visitor who used these articles as an indicator of the prevailing weltanschauung at Wesleyan would probably come to the conclusion that if this campus believes in anything, it believes in questioning authority. That is, unless you question the implicit moral authority of those who question, in which case you’re a reactionary who has to be silenced. But let’s not mince words. It is no surprise, therefore, that even when Wesleyan students exercise authority against other Wesleyan students, it is defied. There is no clearer example of this tendency than the article in Friday’s Argus (“Insult to injury: Failure to Comply stats rise,” Sept. 26, 2008, Volume CXLIV, Number 8), which discussed the overwhelming tide of Failure to Comply violations on this campus. Most students have never met a form of authority they couldn’t blow off with relative impunity, and it is understandably galling to them that the Student Judicial Board (SJB) refuses to be so flippantly treated. It is quite admirable that the SJB is standing firm on this matter, not only because it may finally expunge the prevailing prepubescent attitude that all authority is meaningless, but also because this exercise of unassailable power may actually provoke a discussion about the responsibilities associated with said power. Spiderman’s axiom about the relation between these two concepts desperately needs yet one more historical illustration. Now, there’s no disputing that the SJB has a tough time convincing students of its capacity to be efficacious. It is widely perceived as the guardian of such unenforceable measures as the chalking ban and the underage drinking ban. Being charged with enforcing such measures is utter poison for any judicial authority that wants to be perceived as such, and the SJB is not perceived as such, largely due to the aforementioned immature attitude among students that all authority is useless. However, far from being the libratory ethos which most of Wesleyan’s armchair anarchists believe it to be, this attitude actually provides cover for a few powers which the SJB does possess and which, if the students actually took the time to pay attention, might alarm them terribly. The most prominent example of this sort of power is the SJB’s charge to enforce Wesleyan’s Speech Code. The Orwellian name of this document is not accidental—it is nothing less than a document regulating what students can and cannot say without serious consequences, and if you actually take the time to read the document, you find that we can say very little indeed. For instance, the passage detailing what “Discriminatory Harassment” is defines its subject as follows: “Discriminatory harassment may include any action or statement intended to insult, stigmatize, or degrade an individual or group on the basis of […] race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, national or ethnic origin, veteran status, or any other basis protected by local, state or federal law in any activity administered by the University.” Now, depending on who sits on the SJB, these words could mean practically anything and we’d have no concrete legal way of constraining them from deciding that one remark is hate speech one year and then is not hate speech the following year. In fact, it’s precisely because of passages like this that the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) gave Wesleyan a speech code rating of Red, the worst rating possible, according to its website www.thefire.org. Mind you, nobody ever bothers to contest this sort of abusive and vague language because nobody believes the SJB has any power, and so they never pay attention to it.  More fundamentally, the attitude toward authority at Wesleyan misunderstands a fundamental element in the dialectic between authority and liberty—implicit in any persuasive criticism of authority is the idea that, were it not for a particular flawed abuse, the criticizer would obey the authority. Otherwise, the authority will believe there’s no pleasing the criticizer, and will be happy to bash his skull against the pavement. This is not a positive outcome for an authority figure, or that authority figure’s subjects. Civic engagement is much more productive; but civic engagement requires the pesky notion that there is an authoritative civic entity with which to engage.  Most Wesleyan students aren’t willing to accept this notion, naturally, which is why the SJB ought to keep enforcing those Failure to Comply violations, ruthlessly if necessary. They should do anything necessary to make this campus realize the necessity of loosening the grip of the administration’s iron fist through legitimate, respectful means. Of course, that may be impossible, as most students seem to prefer idly thumb-wrestling with it."

		"title": "Red & Black owner connects student bands with Public Bar",
		"date": "2008-10-03",
		"authors": "by Liz Tung, Arts Editor",
		"content": "Rob DeRosa — who most of you probably know better as the manager of the Red & Black Café — has been a fixture in the Connecticut music scene for years. When he’s not chatting up student musicians, or roasting whole pork shoulders in the R&B kitchen, the Meriden native is busy digging up local bands to book at nearby venues or feature on his “Connecticut connected” WESU show “Homegrown.”  DeRosa even has his own label, Thin Man Music, which has released the music of over 50 Connecticut bands in its seven years of existence.  Despite his years of experience with the local scene, when I asked DeRosa about the process for booking shows at the University, he was vague.  “I’m not sure,” he said. “I’ve never booked a show at Wesleyan.” While this particular lack of town-gown crossover may have perfectly innocent origins (after all, who would want to deal with University bureaucracy when you could just call up a local bar?), it speaks to the discrete, inward looking nature of Wesleyan’s music scene. As DeRosa points out, when student bands play shows, they’re usually relatively informal affairs carried out at on-campus venues, which are almost all student housing, from Eclectic to WestCo to senior houses.  “The campus music scene is insular,” DeRosa said. “If you’re not a student, you are completely excluded. Can a townie go to the dorms? Not likely.”  Wesleyan’s island mentality results in an artistic culture that is not only exclusive, but which, DeRosa says, runs the risk of stunting students’ artistic growth.  “When you play at the dorms, you’re playing in front of your friends,” he explained. “But you can’t just always play in front of the converted. Sometimes you have to convert some of those people yourself. Playing off campus is an important part of a band’s development. You can find out if you’re actually any good, or if your friends are just blowing smoke up your ass.”  It was, in part, out of these concerns that DeRosa’s most recent musical brainchild was born. It all started with the recent opening of Public Bar & Grill, the latest addition to Middletown’s Main Street pub scene. With its respectable stage and ample floor space, the polished, slightly Starbucks-ian Public is an ideal venue for live music. DeRosa originally contacted the owner to book some of his own bands, but after being told that Public only hosted cover bands on the weekends (all Thin Man’s acts are originals), he decided to take a different tack.  “I told him, you know, Wednesday nights are a big bar night for Wesleyan kids, and you need a way to grab a piece of that action,” DeRosa says. “I saw it as an opportunity to bring some music down to Main Street” And so Wesleyan Wednesdays were born: a once-a-week music series at Public featuring Wesleyan bands.  “I tried to get them to call it Wes Wednesdays, but the guy didn’t quite get it,” DeRosa added.  The first WesWed will take place on Oct. 8, with Bottle Up & Go, a whiskey blues duo featuring Keenan Mitchell ’09 on slide guitar and vocals and Fareed Sajan ’09 on drums. The two will be accompanied this coming Wednesday by Lucas Carrico ’09 on saxophone. The band, which Sajan estimates has been around since the 2005-2006 school year, has established itself over the last few years with a number of gigs at Wesleyan, Yale and various venues in Connecticut and New York. The band will also be opening for Man Man at the Heirloom Arts Theatre on Oct. 12. According to Sajan, BU&G’s involvement with Wesleyan Wednesdays grew organically from the University’s informal live music network.  “My friend introduced me to Robbie, and Robbie told me about [the Wesleyan Wednesday series],” Sajan said. “We respected him immediately because he had a piercing. I kind of told Robbie about BU&G, but he said he had heard stuff about us and wanted us to play the first performance at Public.” Given DeRosa’s hope that WesWed will help bridge the gap between the Middletown and Wesleyan music scenes, BU&G seems like an appropriate choice for the series’ debut; not only will they bring a University presence into Middletown venue, but the band’s off-campus experience may help to ease the path for future Wesleyan acts. DeRosa has also secured unofficial promises from Wesleyan alum bands like Bear Hands and Boy Crisis to play future WesWed dates.  DeRosa has several bands lined up for the next few Wednesdays (the Shade will play on Oct. 18, while a Wesleyan jazz group and Blink-182 cover band will perform the following weeks), but he hopes that more University bands will step forward. Performers will get a cut of the night’s profits and pre-show exposure on “Homegrown.” Interested musicians can contact DeRosa at thinmanmusic@sbcglobal.net, or chat him up while grabbing a Red & Black sandwich. As for next Wednesday, DeRosa predicts that there will be a small cover, which will be offset by drink specials. For his part, Sajan promises a solid show, though he has a warning for anyone tempted to drunkenly shout “Freebird.”  “We will be forced to castrate them,” Sajan says. “We have gardening shears always. It is a part of our ’image.’”"

		"content": "This past Wednesday, the Fountain Avenue Commission e-mailed every student on campus a long list of proposed reforms to the University’s security policy. These reforms, which come in the wake of the Fountain incident, detail a myriad of ways to make our campus safer. Issues addressed include town-gown relations, the role of Public Safety and Middletown Police on campus and the use and regulation of handheld cameras. \tWe applaud the Wesleyan Student Assembly for their proposal—and not just because they spent a considerable amount of time on the issue. Were the University to enact their specific, insightful reforms, our campus could very well become a much more congenial place. The Commission has done exactly what is necessary to prevent another Fountain from occurring. \t Most of their ideas address “strained relations” on campus. They propose that Public Safety officers train students to work as escorts, as well as allow students to “shadow” an officer for a day. In addition, they suggest that individual officers be assigned to a given dorm—which, in conjunction with monthly programs, could forge strong bonds between students and their officers. They also apply this mindset to the MPD, who they say could talk with students at regular “Midnight Breakfasts” in Usdan. For students living in woodframe houses, they hope to draw up a map of campus that includes area residents, making it clear what is University property and what is not. All of their recommendations will help build trust on campus—which, considering how little seems to exist between students and police officers, could make the difference between a peaceful dispersal and a skirmish. \tAs for handheld cameras, the Commission is taking steps to protect students and their privacy. They contend that officers can use them to “survey” an area, but cannot use them to track an individual. Additionally, the Student Judicial Board cannot use footage as evidence against a student. The idea is to limit surveillance to the absolutely necessary—a restriction that could go a long way towards protecting students’ rights. \tThe Commission has done a commendable job. By compiling a list of well-thought-out proposals, they have given the University a blueprint for positive change. We hope the administration will work to enact their reforms."

However, judging from the number of Middletown residents who can be seen on campus, you’d never guess that Wesleyan was not a walled fortress. Wesleyan acts like its own separate community, even though we are a part of Middletown. While we learn about racial and class inequalities in our classrooms, we replicate them daily. There is no official, clear University policy about non-University affiliated people using Wesleyan facilities, yet authorities and students act under the assumption that Middletown residents have no place in the Wesleyan community. For example, Middletown residents are frequently kicked out of computer labs, despite our surplus of computers. The University’s official policy on computer lab use by non-University affiliated people is vague and unclear; however, the policy that is actually enforced is very clear: Middletown residents are not allowed in Wesleyan computer labs. Are we happy with the current state of alienation between Middletown residents and Wesleyan students? Allowing people from Middletown to use our abundant resources could be mutually beneficial. It could be great if growing up near Wesleyan was a positive experience for Middletown’s youth, and if Wesleyan students took advantage of living in a diverse and vibrant urban community.  Agree?

		"title": "Argus: Is Prison a Theme Park?",
		"date": "2009-02-03",
		"authors": "by Anna Wiener,",
		"content": "To the Editors of the Wesleyan Argus, Your editorial published on January 30, titled “Prison Experiment Is a Worthy One,” (Volume CXLV, Number 1) was well-intentioned but horribly misguided. Instead of providing support for an important and worthwhile campus initiative, you instead propagated a hateful, ignorant attitude toward incarcerated individuals. On top of that, you revealed yourselves to be navel-gazing and self-important, as well as wholly incapable of throwing your weight behind a project that, for once, does not place Wesleyan students on a golden pedestal. I’ll spare you an indictment of the egregious cartoon you published alongside your editorial, which single-handedly managed to be wildly offensive and casually align prisoners with Nazism (for those who missed this allusion: check out the swastika forehead tattoo). For these reasons, among others that I will outline shortly, it makes me deeply uncomfortable that you are in any position to represent Wesleyan’s student body. First of all, the project (not “experiment”) at the center of your editorial is not called the “Prison Solidarity Project.” It is the Prisoner Solidarity Project (PSP). Take a moment to reflect on the great disparity between these two meanings. Additionally, the fact that you published the name of the project incorrectly suggests that you did not even read the 1.5-page proposal issued by the PSP at last Monday’s symposium. Had you done the bare minimum required of any middling (perhaps aspiring?) journalist, you would have been able to correct your own glaring inconsistencies before allowing them to go to press. To address the meat of your argument point by point, let me begin by repeating a question you pose as one of your “ethical concerns:” “would Wesleyan want to sanction a program that provides inmates with such enormous benefits?” This question essentially asks whether or not incarcerated individuals are deserving of a college-level education. (What an “ethical concern” indeed!) You suggest that excluding the prison population from educational opportunities represents an ethical stance. Given the demographics of the prison population, it is safe to say that certain populations (poor, male, black, Latino) are systematically filtered into the prison system. You are therefore implying that these populations–both in and outside of prison–are undeserving of the same educational opportunities available to those enrolled in an institution like Wesleyan (which, coincidentally, happens to be private, expensive, and around 70 percent white). Adding insult to injury, you later state–with the naïve goodwill of a 17th century missionary–that you believe “the program will have a much greater impact if students, not just professors, get a chance to teach the incarcerated.” (“Get a chance” – really? Is prison a theme park?) Why do you believe this? What makes you think Wesleyan undergraduates are in any way qualified to teach college courses? Either way you slice it, this intimation is a slap in the face to Wesleyan professors, and an insult to those incarcerated. The PSP’s proposal to create a Center for Prison Education would further Wesleyan’s dual commitments to civic engagement and progressive education. Shame on you, Wesleyan Argus, for your painfully counter-productive contribution to this discussion."

		"authors": "by Russell Perkins, on behalf of the Prisoner Solidarity Project",
		"content": "After many years of prisoner advocacy work by Wesleyan students and faculty, including the facilitation of academic workshops in two Connecticut correctional facilities, we propose the establishment of the Wesleyan Center for Prison Education.   The Center’s Plan: Two-Year College-in-Prison pilot program to be run in collaboration with Cheshire Correctional Institution.  Wesleyan Education at Cheshire: 15 inmates will be selected through a rigorous admission process to participate during the first year of the pilot program. Each student will enroll in 2 courses per semester. Courses will be taught by Wesleyan faculty. After two semesters, an additional 15 students will be admitted to the pilot program, producing a total of 30 program participants and 4 courses taught each semester. One transferable undergraduate credit will be awarded upon successful completion of each course. Prison Education at Wesleyan: A POI “Critical Pedagogy” service-learning seminar will be taught at Wesleyan in the fall semester. This course will involve a practicum component in which Wesleyan students tutor inmates that have not yet been accepted into the program. In addition to assisting participants to develop the essential capabilities that will prepare them for enrollment in credit-bearing courses, this component will aim to establish a mutually productive dialogue between Wesleyan students and those incarcerated. This program will be fully funded by private donors not currently drawn upon by Wesleyan University. Because of a conditional commitment from one such source, we are confident that funding will not jeopardize this program. The Center’s Mission: To practice Wesleyan’s commitment to civic engagement by offering college courses to incarcerated individuals, in order to enhance both Wesleyan’s academic community and the lives of those who are systematically denied access to educational opportunities. We believe that educational opportunity should be a fundamental right and recognize that a college education enables effective citizenship. As Wilbur Fisk wrote in 1831 and Wesleyan’s 2005 strategic plan reaffirmed, education serves two purposes: “the good of the individual educated and the good of the world.” This program embodies this core Wesleyan value and will demonstrate Wesleyan’s commitment to quality education, intellectual development and civic engagement.  We hope that you will support this potentially groundbreaking College-in-Prison program. If you have any questions or comments please email: WesleyanPrisonEducation@gmail.com."

		"title": "SDS Forum on Town-Gown Issues: Tear Down that Wall?",
		"date": "2009-02-06",
		"authors": "by Miriam Berger, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "“Right now I’d say that relations, town/gown relations, are better than they’ve been in the past,” said Professor of Sociology Rob Rosenthal. “But we can always do more.” What more the University community can and should do was the topic of debate at a town-gown forum organized by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). At the forum, students and a panel of faculty members and representatives from the Center for Community Partnerships discussed the successes and challenges of University-Middletown relations from both a current and historical perspective. “I think that the point of a forum like that was to open up conversation about whether or not our campus is ‘open’ to folks who aren’t part of the greater Wesleyan community and to get a sense about how different folks on campus feel about that,” said Ruby-Beth Buitekant ’09. At the forum, students shared a number of criticisms of University policy, including concern over the perceived closed nature of the campus and the allocation of educational and recreational resources. Many felt that the University’s expulsion of unregistered guests has sent a hostile message to Middletown residents that is contrary to University aims. “By kicking people off you’re implying that they are not welcome,” said Zak Kirwood ’12, an SDS member. The policy of Public Safety (Psafe) officers concerning residents was also a topic of great concern. Students at the forum shared incidents in which they believe residents were unfairly removed from campus. Students expressed doubt over the criteria for expelling residents, citing examples in which it appeared that individuals were asked to leave arbitrarily and based on race and age. Director of Public Safety Dave Meyer, who did not attend the forum, stressed that this issue is neither easy to solve nor clear-cut. “There are all kinds of people on campus and we don’t just walk up to people on a regular basis and ask them for their ID,” Meyer said. “We do try to be very cautious when we approach someone and have a good reason for it. If we hear reports about suspicious people, we respond to them. Our response is based on the activity of the individual.” Meyer explained that many non-University students come to campus for a variety of reasons and that there is no policy refusing total access to residents. “If you look at Foss Hill on a Sunday afternoon when the hill is used for sledding, there’s probably more non-students than students,” Meyers said. Director of Community Relations Frank Kuan agreed that safety was definitely an issue for the University, students and parents. “Its really for your own safety,” Kuan said. “There are certain responsibilities that the University has in safe guarding buildings.”  Students, however, viewed this response with skepticism. “We couch it in terms of safety,” said Adam Jacobs ’10. “It’s not like all of Middletown will flood in. We assume that people are just going to come in and steal everything. It’s not like I’ve never had things stolen from my floor.” “I think there is a disconnect between how students on campus view the openness of campus and how people who are being asked to leave campus by PSafe view the openness of campus,” Buitekant said. “I think it’s a problem that the situation of people being asked to leave is up to individual decisions that impact the rest of campus.” The forum also touched upon ways that students could become more invested in Middletown, such as expanding housing to Middletown, making library resources more financially and easily accessible, or providing a point system on WesCards that incorporates Middletown stores. Currently, people unaffiliated with the University can, for a fee, apply for guest passes for Olin resources. Many of the issues and sentiments discussed benefited from the context provided by the panelists. Rosenthal described the history of Middletown and University relations throughout his 20 years on campus.  “It’s never been a ‘university’ town,” Rosenthal said. “There’s always been somewhat of a divide. You can’t wish away social structure.” According to Rosenthal, there is a common tendency among universities to ignore the specific needs of surrounding areas. He described the economic improvement of Middletown over the past two decades and lauded the University’s receptive behavior. He specifically noted the progressive work of former President Douglass Bennet who refrained from meddling in Middletown matters and implementing policies that could have promoted gentrification.  Kuan shared a similar sentiment. He explained that lack of connection and misinformation from both sides has been a common source of disharmony. “There has definitely been improvement in communication–if there are issues we can come to some sort of agreement,” Kuan said “We have to keep the focus on what can benefit the community and University and focus on our educational mission. I think any town relationship can still be improved.” Kuan cited examples of the campus opening up to residents—such as for school art shows and music festivals—and lamented that resources were too limited to be shared more uniformly among students and residents. “I think it is a good conversation,” Kuan said. “Students have great energy and we should work to capture that. In challenging economic times we have to work together on short-term, doable as well as mutually beneficial projects but should keep in mind that payouts [for student-driven projects] may not be immediate and could be longer-term.”    The panelists also noted other partnerships between the University and Middletown, such as the Center for Community Partnership, which finds opportunities for collaboration between University students and Middletown groups, and Service Learning classes, which incorporate Middletown-based projects into the curriculum. Additionally, the PILOTS program provides state reimbursement to Municipalities, such as Middletown, for unallocated taxes from tax-exempt properties and private institutions like Wesleyan. Yet some students questioned whether this was the most effective approach and addressed the root of the issues. “Is our having a lot of resources and using them to volunteer the only way in which we think of our relationship to Middletown?” Buitekant said. “I don’t think it should just be about volunteering.” Another consistent issue of discourse regarded the University allotment of resources. Jacobs questioned the University’s decisions and whether resources could have been better spent for the benefit of both the University and Middletown. “Wes just spent well over a million dollars to build a campus center that students don’t even enjoy…” Jacobs said. “I’m just saying…” Professor of History William Pinch, the third panelists, offered a different view of University town-gown relations.  “Too often a lot of what we hear is what Wesleyan has done for Middletown,” Pinch said. “It ends up creating an impression that Middletown can’t do anything for itself, that its just there and hopeless, a black hole that simply sucks resources from it [the University].” Pinch, a resident of Middletown, described the benefits of living in such a diverse and historic area. “From my perspective Wesleyan should be recruiting people to come here because it is in Middletown,” he said. Rosenthal too emphasized that interactions among students and residents are crucial for improving relations and suggested that they have already led to great improvements. “About every four years people get upset,” Rosenthal said. “Someone should take it on themselves to do research–where there are patterns, where there are exclusions.” SDS members plan to hold another town-gown forum this semester that will incorporate more Middletown residents in the dialogue, as well as press for changes and clarifications to PSafe policies."

		"title": "Pernick and Carlin Form New Outreach Committee",
		"date": "2009-02-27",
		"authors": "by Jen Cohen, Staff Writer",
		"content": "In October of last semester, the WSA submitted a proposal to enhance the collaboration between students and administrators on University outreach. Last week, the newly formed University Outreach Committee—a product of Mike Pernick ’10 and Saul Carlin ’09, WSA President and Vice President, respectively—met for the first time. The committee, which consists of administrators and members of the WSA, will meet several times per semester to discuss the University’s image and ways of improving its communication. “Mike and I had been talking about strengthening University Relations between students and administrators [on this issue],” Carlin said.  “President Roth was really enthusiastic about the idea.” As the University Outreach Committee’s proposal states, “A sustained consultative relationship will enable productive, ongoing dialogue, and promote thinking that will foster creative, worthwhile, beneficial feedback on issues relating to university outreach.” According to Carlin, while University Relations has been successful, they could benefit from the input of students, who offer a different perspective than the administration. Both Pernick and Carlin agreed that collaboration on such issues is unprecedented. “The purpose of a university is for students,” Pernick said. “It is imperative to consult with the students who go here, [so that they] have a say in how the University portrays itself to the rest of the world.” During the first meeting, committee members discussed the ways in which the Internet can be utilized for reaching perspective students, current students, and alumni. Students provided insight into how Facebook, YouTube, and College Confidential can be used for marketing and social networking.  The committee also agreed on the importance of self-promotion through written and video testimonials. Members discussed the possibility of making course syllabi available on the website, so that perspective students can gain insight into coursework.  They also weighed the pros and cons of taping some classes and putting them on the Internet—a strategy used by several schools, such as MIT.  In the future, the committee will discuss admissions, town-gown relations, and press coverage.   The committee consists of four core members: President Michael Roth, Andy Tanaka, Assistant to the President for University Relations, Carlin, and Pernick.  Others present at the first meeting included administrators appointed by Roth, as well as three self-selected WSA members. New topics of discussion will bring in different students and administrators. According to Tanaka, the frequency of the meetings is flexible, but they will meet as often as necessary.   Committee members agree that the first meeting was a success. “The good news is we actually proved ourselves in these meetings,” Pernick said.  “We proved they are going to be worthwhile.”"

		"title": "MPD Intensifies Enforcement",
		"date": "2009-03-27",
		"authors": "by Katherine Yagle, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "The Middletown Police Department (MPD) is cracking down on underage drinking laws using an $85,000 grant received in 2006. The grant was obtained from the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services through the Rushford Center, a substance abuse and mental health provider in Connecticut. “We enforce the laws that already exist,” said Deputy Chief of Police Patrick McMahon in an e-mail to The Argus. “This enforcement grant allows us to be more proactive.” MPD is using the grant money to step up DUI patrols, enforcement of false identification laws and compliance checks for establishments that sell liquor.  “Local data indicated that the magnitude and severity of underage drinking in the Middletown community was high,” said Rushford’s Prevention Manager Sheryl Sprague, who applied for the grant, via e-mail. “We hope to reduce retail availability of alcohol to minors, increase enforcement of alcohol laws and policies and reduce social access to minors.” One of the largest issues that data collection in Middletown revealed was that minors in the community have considerable access to alcohol.  “Data regarding sale of alcohol indicate that Middletown bars, restaurants and stores far too often illegally sell alcohol to those under the legal age of 21,” Sprague said.  To address this issue, MPD is focusing not only on enforcing laws that affect minors who illegally purchase alcohol, but on ensuring that liquor vendors are not selling to anyone underage. This involves checking licenses of liquor-serving establishments and conducting compliance checks. Undercover compliance checks in 2006 identified four Middletown establishments that sold alchohol to two volunteer minors. Eli Wilson ’09, Beer Manager at Forest City Wines and Spirits on the north end of Main Street, believes the grant has the potential to benefit liquor stores if it provides better ways to identify minors. “As far as policing underage drinking, we are by law required to check ID,” he said. “[But] there is actually a fair amount of discretion involved. The state does not provide us with a concrete way of telling if an ID is fake or real. My manager feels that if the state wanted to be very serious about policing underage drinking, at least in terms of buying alcohol, they should provide us with some kind of booklet.” Wilson said he would like to see more collaboration between police and liquor vendors in order to help such establishments prevent sale of alcohol to minors. Forest City, he said, tries to enforce alcohol laws as best as possible; he has never personally seen someone turned away because of a fake ID, however.  Stricter enforcement of drinking laws could have many effects on University students. MPD has been in contact with Public Safety regarding the grant. “Students hosting large scale parties where alcohol is present have the obligation to uphold the law, including not providing alcohol to minors,”  Sprague said. “Under the social host law they can receive legal consequences for providing alcohol to those under 21, especially if high school age students are involved.” Under Connecticut General Statute 30-89a, allowing minors to drink on premises one has control over is an infraction for a first offense, and a misdemeanor for any subsequent offense. A misdemeanor can result in up to 12 months in jail.  In addition to the risks students 21 and over may face by hosting parties, the grant may influence the minors on campus. The grant focuses not only on the law enforcement, but also on compliance.  Sonia Mañjon, Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships, has provided information about the grant to WesWell. Mañjon meets with Middletown’s Mayor, Chief of Police, and Chief of Fire Department in a quarterly meeting to discuss town-gown relations. When she learned of tighter enforcement of alchohol laws, she passed the information along to Director of Health Education Lisa Currie. Sprague has also been working with WesWell to encourage students to drink safely and responsibly.   “We hope to reinforce health and safety messages,” she said. “Large scale parties where minors are providing or consuming alcohol will be addressed.” Despite the many ways the grant could influence the University, it is primarily focused on middle and high school students, according to Sprague.  “Students need to understand that this isn’t targeted at Wesleyan,” said Dave Meyer, Director of Public Safety. “It’s community-wide.” MPD, the Rushford Center and Public Safety agree that University students should be aware of the grant and its possible repercussions. They hope that it will result in increased compliance with underage drinking laws.  “Underage drinking is not a harmless rite-of-passage,” Sprague said. “More young people die of alcohol-related causes than all other illicit drugs combined. The societal costs of underage drinking are huge.”"

		"title": "Two Years In, Roth Looks Back",
		"date": "2009-05-05",
		"authors": "by Katherine Yagle, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "Argus: What do you feel you have accomplished in the face of the recession over these past two years? President Michael Roth: I think balancing the budget this year and creating a plan for long term sustainability has been a joint accomplishment of the faculty, students, trustees and staff. I was proud to lead that effort and try to bring our spending in relation to our resources. Being more prudent about our capital expenditures last year and this year has been very important. We have improved financial aid, reducing student indebtedness by 35 percent overall. The economy has prevented us from making as much progress as I’d hoped in many areas because we’ve been working on balancing the budget. I’ve spent a lot of time consulting with different constituencies, making sure we have enough to money to get through tough times. A: What are your goals for the future? MR: I would like to see Wesleyan become confident in its distinctiveness, sure of itself as a leader in American higher education, and articulate in expressing what we stand for. There are seven areas that have been the most important points of focus. The first is enhanced financial aid—when I first started we immediately changed the financial aid program to make it more generous to our neediest student, which I think is very important especially in light of the current recession. The second goal is investment in the sciences. We’ve postponed a major capital expense for our  new science building but we still need to invest in the sciences—and in people and in equipment. As the economy improves, I think we’ll be able to start doing just that. The third area is called curricular reform; I’ve focused on the first year and last year. I would like to see the first year experience to be much more of a cohort-building threshold experience, providing students with the sense that they’re in a different kind of place—some place unlike wherever they’ve studied before. The other thing I’ve mentioned is a senior capstone experience; eventually I’d like to see everybody graduating from Wesleyan accomplishing an independent project of some kind—not necessarily a scholarly thesis, but some kind of independent project to serve as a transition between Wesleyan and whatever comes next. The fourth goal is internationalization. Wesleyan has had approximately seven percent of its students from outside the US; I’d like to see that doubled over several years. I also want to make sure the curriculum is as international and cosmopolitan as possible. It has to be a faculty-led process whereby we examine each sector of the curriculum to ensure that the education our students are getting what prepares them to be global citizens, not just members of the US economy and culture. The next two areas are things people have long said about Wesleyan students that I’m not convinced we have anchored in our curriculum. The first is that we’re an activist bunch, with a lot of politics on campus. Rather than try to run away from that image, I think we should embrace it. Wes students should learn how to be more effective neighbors and citizens, more effective at civic engagement because of their time on campus. The other thing people say about Wesleyan students is that we’re a creative bunch. I want to make sure that creativity is actually an innovation, plugged into the curriculum, so that it’s not just for the studio art majors but something that is accessible for everyone. In every department, there are ways I believe we can help people become more creative or at least be more aware of the creative possibilites. The last area is the College of the Environment, which we’ve taken a big step towards an obligatory linked major, which has just been approved by the faculty. Eventually, I’d like that to become our new College of the Environment. We have the College of Social Studies and the College of Letters, both of which are celebrating their 50th anniversaries. It’s the perfect time to start the College of the Environment. All of these are attempts to take what Wesleyan students stand for and to try to make us better and more serious about those things. It’s important for the President to talk about these initiatives in the public sphere, and so I’ve spent a fair amount of time trying to share what Wesleyan stands for, traveling around the country meeting with alumni, giving speeches, and writing for the Huffington Post and the Los Angeles Times. A: In what ways has Wesleyan changed since you were a student? MR: I think there’s a spirit at Wesleyan that’s remained strong. This sense of practical idealism, of people who have great ambition and dream big but learn to acquire skills that allow them to operate in the world and to make stuff happen—this was characteristic of Wesleyan in the seventies and is still so. Things that have changed…the role of parents has changed enormously since I was a student. My parents heard from me once a week—now there are students who call their parents before they call their advisor. I don’t think it’s a sign of the strength of the family, but a sign that people are not allowed to grow up. Parents are concerned and parents are often paying, but the fact is that students are adults. But this isn’t a Wesleyan change—it’s a national change. Wesleyan has a lot more school spirit now than when I was a student, and I think that’s a good thing. I belonged to Alpha Delta Phi and I was very involved with the activities of the fraternity but I’d never heard the fight song—I didn’t even know there was a fight song! Wesleyan students sing it not so much with irony as with glee. Of course, part of the student culture is oppositional and that’s also a very good thing, but I think we express our school spirit more freely today than in the past. A: What was your experience at Wesleyan like? MR: I was involved in some political things but I was very serious about my studies. I was only here three years so I had a lot to do quickly. I worked in the kitchen at Alpha Delt, so I was there late at night and early in the morning. I wanted to be a writer so I wrote short stories and poetry, some of which were published in Hermes. I volunteered in a hospital psychiatric ward, I tutored an elementary school kid, I was a senior interviewer, I was a T.A. in psychology. Now that I think about it, I wonder how I had the time, but there were just so many interesting things to do. A: What does Wesleyan stand for to you? MR: This is what I hope to be talking about with students and faculty over the next year. To me, Wesleyan represents a progressive liberal arts education, meaning that it’s a leader in higher education and that other people follow what we do. I suppose one way to think about Wesleyan’s future is that we want to be a better school, richer, more selective, but that’s boring to me. Wesleyan isn’t just another liberal arts college that’s hard to get into. We have stood for something special, for creativity, for political engagement, for a research-oriented curriculum. These are qualities to build on in the future. A: What do you think are the greatest challenges going into next year? MR: There are still great economic challenges to giving people the resources they need to be great at what they do. There are cultural challenges in getting people to think: “What does the University as a whole stand for?” Sometimes it’s very hard for someone in one field to talk to someone in another, so we have to find ways of bridging that. I disagree with anyone who says we should just be a small teaching school. At Wesleyan, our teaching is great because our research is deep. Research shouldn’t isolate us—it should give us more ways of linking to one another.  A: What plans do you have to address the budgetary crisis in the future? MR: I would like to see Wesleyan much more economically secure than we are today. The short term goal is to put spending in line with resources, which we’ve almost done. The long term goal is to increase economic capacity so that we know that the important things are here to stay. I would like to see a much larger portion of the financial aid program endowed, so at the next campaign I hope to raise a couple hundred million dollars. It’s not just about raising money to spend in a year, but saving and investing so that over time our financial aid program will be secure. We have created emergency funds through cost-cutting and we have tried to show our donors that we are responsible and creative stewards of generosity. A lot of what I’ve talked about—the core values, what we stand for—are  good in themselves but if we do them well we will also inspire generosity. Communication about these values and programs is really important; we need more people around the world to know that we have something very special at this university. A: Overall, what are your feelings about your first two years as president? MR: I’m not satisfied. There are things I’m proud of, I’ve made some mistakes, I joke around a lot and sometimes say things I shouldn’t say. As President, I want to show respect for all members of the Wesleyan community. I think I can do more to help the University realize its potential and I think I have to be an even better listener. As you can see, I like to talk, but I really want to be a good listener so I can understand what students, alumni, faculty, trustees, and staff think about where we’re going. The more I can understand other points of view, the more effective I’ll be as a leader."

		"content": "My cardinal spirit was in full effect this past Sunday when Matthew Weiner ’87, the creator of the series Mad Men, walked away with two Emmy awards for both best drama, and for writing. Since its premiere in July of 2007, the show has taken home the best drama award two years in a row, wowing audiences with its refreshing and unique script, drop dead gorgeous actors, and escapist nostalgia for times not that long ago.  Though I know nothing about the advertising industry, I do know classic fashion and Mad Men is a prime example of impeccably polished, classically American, and historically accurate fashion. From Don Draper’s suits, Joan Harris’ waist cinching sheaths, and even little Sally Draper’s madras midriffs, each week I am in awe of the varying color palate and precise tailoring exhibited on every member of the cast. Costume designer Janie Bryant purchases and creates vintage pieces to bring the men and women of Mad Men to life.  Showing a keen eye for refined fit on varying body types while still harnessing old American glamour, Bryant has invigorated an already thriving vintage and consignment market. Though shopping vintage has the potential to break the bank, Bryant claims that some of her best finds came from a Salvation Army in midtown Manhattan. While the retail industry has seen a marked decline in consumer spending in light of the economic downturn, establishments like Salvation Army and Goodwill are seeing an increase in traffic from shoppers of all economic classes.  Though finding Betty Draper’s nightgown could prove damn near impossible, there are many treasures to behold in a local thrift store, especially in Middletown. I suggest digging through the crates if you’re trying to save some cash. Having worked as a costume designer last year, stores like Never Say Goodbye and Trusted Servant offer up an array of gowns, men’s’ apparel, and accessories that hearken back to the days of drinking on the job and smoking while pregnant. A fashion favorite of Wesleyan students, cocktails dresses, costume jewelry and Dior sports coats are common finds at these hot spots.  The rumor mill suggests that there may be a line inspired by Mad Men in the works, but if you want to get a head start on creating your own ’60s ensembles, look no further than the aisles of the nearest thrift shop.                 \r       \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\tAbout amchung\r       \t\t\t\t\tAllyson Chung is a member of the Class of 2010.

		"title": "Battle in the Chapel: Middletown Mayoral Candidates Duke It Out On Campus",
		"date": "2009-10-09",
		"authors": "by Jen Cohen , Staff Writer",
		"content": "The University hosted Middletown’s first official mayoral debate between Republican incumbent Sebastian Giuliano and Democratic challenger Dan Drew on Tuesday. Students and Middletown residents headed to Memorial Chapel where the candidates answered questions on the City’s shrinking budget, Food Not Bombs, transportation, and the University’s relationship with Middletown. Independent candidate Ruth Ann Johnson was unable to participate in the event. The debate was moderated by Lily Mandlin ’10, who spent the first hour asking the candidates pre-selected questions submitted by the University community and various Middletown groups. Throughout the debate, Drew criticized Giuliano’s tax increases and Middletown Police Department’s job cuts, emphasizing the need for new leadership. Giuliano accused the Democratic council of stretching the city’s limited financial resources and blocking his efforts to improve conditions. The candidates took opposing sides on the Middletown Health Department’s decision to shut down Food Not Bombs. “I’m glad the state acted,” Giuliano said.  “[It] took actions that were pursuant with the public health code.” He added that the state legislature created the problem through their rigid wording of the public health code. Drew disagreed, calling the city’s actions excessive. “[The state used] undue force for groups that were looking to feed the hungry, feed the needy in a time when people needed it the most,” he said. When asked about the future of town-gown relations, Drew promised to keep lines of communication open by meeting regularly with President Roth and University students. Giuliano countered that such communication already exists. “What is really important is to get students involved,” Giuliano said, suggesting that students could fill some vacancies on the City Board. The candidates spent much of the debate discussing Middletown’s budget, which has been hit hard by the economic crisis and has become burdened by increasing demands. “[We need] to take a look at the budget line by line and determine what our priorities are,” Drew said. “We have to be careful not to cut things that make Middletown what it is.” When Mandlin asked about community dissatisfaction with public transportation, both candidates agreed that this area needs improvement. “The next thing on the table is to get rid of the car, because we are an urban district,” Giuliano said. Giuliano discussed plans for a rail system. Drew said he hopes to improve the bus system and to implement a small trolley-like transportation system. On several occasions, Drew accused Giuliano of reneging on his promise not to raise taxes. “This man pledged to be a tax-cutter coming into office,” Drew said. “He is anything but. There should never be an inverse relationship between the services you receive and the tax increases.” Giuliano said that the budgetary review is a line-by-line process. He stressed that the city council is primarily responsible for the city budget and spending, and that since the Democrats have held an 8-4 majority, there has been a major gap between revenue and spending. Giuliano also said that Drew’s policies would send Middletown further down a path of increased taxes. The candidates’ opinions differed the most in their views on the decision to cut six police officers from the Middletown Police Department. When questioned on how to combat crime in the city and at the University, Drew expressed the need for increased police presence, and repeatedly criticized the mayor’s decision. Giuliano stressed that while he is dedicated to public safety, he is pessimistic that the police academy can be filled to capacity. In their closing statements, the candidates continued to point out faults in their opponent’s platforms. “If we look back at the mayor’s record, we see promises broken,” Drew said. “We need a leader who is looking towards the future.” Giuliano, in turn, criticized the Democratic Party. “One thing that will ensure a better future is not to do the same thing that created the situations of the present,” Giuliano countered. “I think [Drew’s] party is heading down the same road. Someone told me the path of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. We need to stop mortgaging our future and start paying it off.”"

The Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA)’s Community Outreach Committee (COCo) is sponsoring the event, which will take place at the Riverview Center on Main Street and will feature student musicians and a table run by COCo. The Ride will provide transportation for students from campus to Main Street. Main Street restaurants will be selling food at tables at the center and offering 10 to 20 percent discounts to students. Their menus will be circulated on campus shortly before the event. Featured establishments will include La Boca, It’s Only Natural, Cold Stone, and others. “By integrating Middletown residents and Wesleyan students, [we hope to show] that we are friendly to their business,” said COCo Chair Sylvie Stein ’12. Originally planned for Oct. 17, the event was postponed after the Middletown Police Department was unable to provide electricity for that date. The WSA has now pushed the event to the spring because of Middletown’s Holiday Event on Main Street, which will involve restaurants that do not want to offer student discounts during that week."

		"title": "Giuliano Beats Drew, Begins Third Term as Mayor",
		"date": "2009-11-06",
		"authors": "by Amanda Schwartz, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "On Tuesday, the Republican incumbent Middletown Mayor Sebastian Giuliano beat his Democratic challenger, Dan Drew, to enter his third term. Although the City is predominantly Democratic, Giuliano received 4,388 votes in comparison to Drew’s 3,902. Ruthann Johnson of the Realistic Balance Party received 104 votes. Giuliano attributed the win to his track record for the past two terms. “What got me re-elected was pretty much how I conducted myself and this office for the last four years,” Giuliano said in an interview with The Argus. Polls opened at 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning at 14 polling locations throughout the City. Most students voted at the Senior Center on William Street, which accounts for District 14 in Middletown. The polling station, which went to Drew, reported a turnout of 23.4  percent of registered voters in the District. The citywide turnout was 36 percent of 23,511 total registered voters. Although this is an increase from the 31.9 percent in 2007 when Giuliano ran unopposed, it is a sharp decline from 2005 when Giuliano was first elected with 45.9 percent voter turnout. Giuliano explained that a large part of his campaign efforts focused on convincing Middletown residents to actually vote. “I was kind of uneasy throughout the entire campaign; I kept on hearing, ‘Oh you’re in. Oh, you’re a shoe-in,’” Giuliano said. “Usually when that kind of sentiment is going around, it tends to depress turnout. You kind of open yourself up for a sneak attack.” Giuliano characterized voter turnout on Tuesday as average. Drew, however, felt that voter turnout was low and that this may have contributed to his loss. “If turnout had been a little bit higher I think we could have had a better a chance of winning, but I’m really proud of how far we came,” Drew said in an interview with The Argus. Giuliano had strongest support in the residential districts of the city located in the west and south, whereas Drew carried the center of the city. Last month, the University hosted the first official mayoral debate between Giuliano and Drew. Issues broached included the City’s declining budget, Food Not Bombs, and the University’s relationship with Middletown. President Michael Roth reported that he voted on Tuesday. He stressed the importance of University town-gown relations. “I hope that we continue to increase the positive communication that we’ve been having with the City of Middletown from the mayor to the City Council to the School Board,” he said. “A lot of things are going on. It has been a steady improvement over the last year and a half or so and I expect that to continue.” Both the Wesleyan Democrats (WesDems) and the Wesleyan College Republicans (WCR) campaigned for their parties’ respective candidates on campus and throughout Middletown. The weekend before the election both groups stepped up their efforts, making calls to both students and Middletown residents to encourage them to vote. This year, 226 University students registered to vote in Middletown, bringing the total number to 753 University students, according to the Middletown registrar. Of the 753 students, 546 are registered as Democrats, 17 as Republicans, 186 are unaffiliated, and four are registered as other. “If Wesleyan [students] turned out in the numbers that they could have, it would have been a smaller margin [between Giuliano and Drew], because there were so many registered Democratic voters, assuming they voted along party lines,” said Alex Levin ’12, President of the WCR. Both groups encouraged students to register to vote in Connecticut, despite hesitancy from some students on transferring voter registration from their home states. “A lot of students think that because they’re only here for four years [it is not necessary to vote in Middletown elections],” said President of WesDems Corinne Duffy ’11. “But it is four years of your life, and it’s as much our home for four years as the community that you’re from. And it’s important to make any community that you’re in better.” Levin explained that the WCR’s involvement in the campaign demonstrated the role students could play in local politics. “I think [Giuliano is] starting to realize how much more of an impact Wesleyan students can have on municipal elections—not that he didn’t care before,” Levin said. “Especially now with the WSA’s [Wesleyan Student Assembly] debate he knows we’re paying attention to local politics more. I only see participation growing in the next couple years, not diminishing.” Although Duffy expressed disappointment in Drew’s loss, she felt that the WesDems still made an impact. “We showed the City that we are a political force and we are willing to take a stand for elections,” she said. Post-election, Drew has not given up his commitment to Middletown and said he may run again in 2011. “I’m going to stay involved and keep working on behalf of the community,” Drew said. “There’s a very good opportunity I may run again in two years.”"

		"authors": "by Lily Mandlin,",
		"content": "Each year, I find it gets harder to fight my own cynicism.  Each class, each reading, each discussion I have at Wesleyan leaves me feeling all the more certain that there are more problems in this world that even an entire college of well-intentioned, educated, and smart students and professors can fix.  It’s disheartening to say the least.  But to a few students and staff members, these impasses are not dead-ends.  Instead, a roadblock is a signal for a better plan, a call for inspiration and perspiration.  More often than not, I’m one of those students. Wesleyan is full of people who would like to “do good.” Many even pursue these ends to some degree.  Some take it to another level, making a change in a community that is their own or in which they identify some need that they can address.  The work of “public service” or “community engagement” can seem thankless from the outside.  Why a person truly does what he or she does is a question that reaches beyond my own contemplation.  What motivates a “good deed” is only our best guess. But in the simplest terms, a volunteer or an activist does what she or he does because they see it needs to be done and that they can do it, if they just tried a little harder.  Sometimes you have to try more than a little hard—sometimes despite your personal flame fueling the project, it still fails.  And that failure may be, again, the end for many.  But for some, it’s another beginning, an envisioning of the process or a reevaluation of the better ends of the project. If you know of someone on this campus who fits that description, they may be a candidate for the Peter Morganstern-Clarren Award for Social Justice.  Your friend or mentor may be the person who always pushes a little more than most when something needs to get done, who volunteers when it does not clearly benefit them, who moves you to be better and work harder at your own endeavors. And if that “type of person” is you, then you’ve recognized perhaps what’s most important about public service. Public service is mutualism—that you do what you do because it drives you. The parents of Peter Morganstern-Clarren ’03 created an award to honor their son, a Wesleyan student who worked tirelessly for labor issues and organized the Wesleyan community in support of his ideals.  Sophomores and Juniors who follow, perhaps unknowingly, in his footsteps are eligible to apply for this award.  Staff members are eligible and can be nominated by a student, or students, who have been touched by their presence in their lives.  Both staff and student awards come with a financial gift.  As last year’s selected student, I felt both honored by the recognition of the selection committee and grateful for this generous gift.  I urge all students who believe they are eligible to apply and all students who know of a member of Wesleyan’s staff who be a fitting recipient to nominate them. The award has been, for me, not only a recognition of past endeavors, but another push forward towards more work to come.  The award bears the name of beloved and honored student and thus, his legacy.  It is not only a gift recognizing work that has been done, but a sign of faith that the recipient will carry on public service work into the future. Recipients of the Peter Morganstern-Clarren award move forward with their acts of social justice to honor an activist whose vision endures beyond his life.  While seeking a professional career in an economy that has left no one untouched by strife, the knowledge that the Peter Morganstern-Clarren selection committee had confidence in me compels me to continue to seek more opportunities to make positive contributions. For more information about the Peter Morganstern-Clarren Awards for Social Justice (either employee or student prize) please contact Dean Marina Melendez at mmelendez@wesleyan.edu.  If you seek advice on the application process, you’re welcome to contact me at lmandlin@wesleyan.edu. All nominations must be in by February 26, 2010."

		"title": "Mytheology (Wesleyan Viewed From the Right…and the West Coast): A Joint Partnership",
		"date": "2009-12-26",
		"authors": "by Mytheos Holt, Ancient Conserva-Blarger",
		"content": "Author’s Note: Observing the current controversy over the election of Mr. Giant Joint, it has become immediately apparent to me that a brief exit from my Winter Break oasis of literary isolation in the California hills is not only appropriate, but essential. Though my original plan had been to leave the topic for my first column of the second semester, it is important to strike while the iron is hot, or, to use a more apt metaphor, to inhale while the joint is still lit, so I will make one exception to my “no columns during breaks” rule and submit this. This Christmas morning, fresh from a lovely and long sleep on West Coast time, I awoke to find a precious gift waiting under the tree – a first edition, signed copy of H.L. Mencken’s Notes on Democracy, a document which contains many exceedingly well-taken insights on the peculiar American political neurosis of which the title speaks. Mr. Mencken observes, for instance, that “Democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage.” Harsh though this statement is, I must admit to feeling a sort of ghoulish joy upon reading it, given the context of the election of a Mr. Giant Joint to the Wesleyan Student Assembly. Before proceeding with this column, however, let me take the time to congratulate Mr. Joint on his victory after so many soul-crushing defeats, and also to assure him that I bear him no ill will whatsoever for besting me in the 2010 Class Representative election of a few years ago. If one proposes to try to stand in the way of history, one must be prepared to get crushed occasionally (much as Alan Keyes did when he attempted to stop the juggernaut known as Barack Obama), and I am confident that trying to compete with Mr. Joint is one such case (not to mention I am sure that he will make for an infinitely wiser legislator than Mr. Obama). However, it appears that, in a true example of politically motivated cruelty, many of my peers have begun trying to wrest Mr. Joint’s victory from him before he can properly enjoy it. They raise such superfluous objections as the idea that Mr. Joint is not a Wesleyan student (an utterly moot point, given that I suspect these same people voted for President Obama, who, as we all know from his speeches, professes to be a citizen of the world rather than the United States), and also that his election “degrades” the WSA. Ironically, I find myself in complete agreement with this latter charge (though perhaps not with its terminology), yet this is one reason why I think Mr. Joint’s seating is not only necessary, but that to do otherwise would constitute a severe miscarriage of justice. Mr. Joint emphatically should be seated – not as a monument to the joyful success of Democracy, but as a living, breathing, smoking symbol of its inevitable teleological descent into mediocrity and apathetic, puerile childishness, at the dreadful point where civic engagement has become nothing but a postmodern practical joke. Not merely that, but his solemnly wafting presence in the halls of power should serve as a powerful reminder to the WSA itself of its own complete irrelevance, and the fire of his sizzling, contraband conviction should amply achieve the valuable task of puncturing the slowly swelling balloon of insular self-importance which pervades that institution. Practiced readers of this column will have to forgive the cynicism of my old age, but the recent uselessness of the WSA over my four years here is a topic which has been scandalously ignored, to the detriment of Wesleyan students everywhere. If nothing else, Mr. Joint has done us all a service by bring it to the fore, and exposing these self-important elections for the sham that they are – every year, a portion of our parents’ hard-earned tuition money, or of our much pleaded for student loans, or in some cases of our own money gets poured into the WSA, with the express purpose of funding student activities, student government, and some variant thereof. The WSA is even given its own office within Usdan, as though it were an arm of the administration (which at times, it may as well be). And what does the WSA do with its hallowed money and its specifically allocated office in Usdan, besides supply us with a convenient free photocopier, red-stamping Michael Roth’s rampage through our endowment, caving to insane protestors calling for the university to mortgage its future in the name of some nebulously defined abstraction known only by the saccharine name of “social responsibility” and allowing the smarmiest members of the exact same groups on-campus to bolster their resumes year after year? What they do is waste our money on pointless new committees, squander it by creating new “funds” with socially conscious names and then by asking us to approve them in costly elections ex post facto, violating the rules they write for themselves and then changing those after the fact, and generally allow a collection of shamelessly amateurish politicos to cut their pork barrel teeth squabbling over a pot of forcefully expropriated money! And let’s not forget telling us to respect organizations designed to trample all over every Western notion of due process with Orwellian “speech codes” and bizarre rulings! Unfair? Perhaps, but harsh though my assessment may be of the reasons for the WSA’s farcical perception among the student population, one cannot deny that the perception exists, given the election of Mr. Joint. To be sure, part of the problem is the general apathy and childishness of a student body for whom posts on the ACB constitute meaningful political discourse, but let us confine ourselves to problems we can actually solve. I, for one, do not think that students find it easy to view the WSA elections with any sort of dignity at all at the point where many candidacy statements – especially the ones which, God forbid, try to be funny – are such an affront to our intelligence. In any case, Mr. Joint’s election should be respected as the exercise in legitimate, commonplace Democratic decision-making that it is. If nothing else, it will save the members of the WSA the trouble of indulging their tastes for illicit substances outside the conference room, and perhaps – just perhaps – Mr. Joint’s tenure will be sufficiently unimpressive, and the WSA’s performance will be that much improved, that students can be induced to give a damn about his seat again. In the meantime, Mr. Joint should remain elected as a warning to all members of the WSA currently serving that there, but for the grace of God, incumbency and devoted friends go they.                 \r       \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\tAbout Ezra Silk\r       \t\t\t\t\tI have been interested in journalism ever since I was an editor at my high school student newspaper, where I was involved in a freedom of speech controversy that was covered in the local newspaper as well as local television and radio outlets.

		"title": "New Certificate To Encourge Civic Engagement Among Students",
		"date": "2010-02-12",
		"authors": "by Amanda Schwartz, News Editor",
		"content": "From service-learning courses suchas Activism and Outreach Through Theater to tutoring programs at Middletown schools, Wesleyan provides students many opportunities to get involved outside the Ivory Tower. On Jan. 29, however, a joint faculty and staff committee submitted a proposal that would make the University’s commitment to community service official. A new Civic Engagement Certificate (CEC) is currently being reviewed by the Educational Policy Committee (EPC), which consists of two WSA members, six faculty members, and Provost Joseph Bruno. If approved, the certificate will appear on WesMaps, the University’s course catalog, next fall. “This allows students who are involved in different forms of civic engagement at Wesleyan to tie them all together into a coherent program with an academic component,” said Civic Engagement Committee member and Sociology Professor Rob Rosenthal. If approved, the certificate would be available to members of the class of 2013 and subsequent classes. According to the proposal, students will not have to fulfill any requirements before applying to the CEC. The proposed program would have a range of requirements starting with a foundation course geared towards sophomores interested in pursuing the certificate. Tentatively scheduled to be taught by Rosenthal next fall, the course would present civic engagement from a historical perspective and analyze its significance. In addition to the gateway course, students would need to take five other civic engagement courses. The proposal lists courses offered during the 2009-2010 academic year that theoretically could meet that requirement including Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems, an Earth and Environmental Science course, Physics for Future Presidents, a Physics course, and Sociology of Economic Change: Latin American Responses to Global Capitalism, a course in the Sociology Department. Outside of the classroom, students would need to complete two or more semesters of service work through the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism (OCS), in addition to an internship that could be done either during the academic year or over the summer. “We want students to have some practical experience,” said Civic Engagement Committee Chair and Service Learning Center Director Professor Suzanne O’Connell. In their senior year, students would take a senior seminar capstone course to complete the certificate. The capstone course, which would not be offered until the current freshmen are seniors, would require students to work together on a larger project focusing on civic engagement at Wesleyan. “We want the CEC students to be a cohort,” O’Connell said. “Students that are spending time together, working together, and talking about civic engagement.” President Michael Roth approved the Civic Engagement Committee in the 2007-2008 academic year in order to establish a stronger niche for civic engagement at the University. “The effort to develop a certificate in civic engagement is coming from faculty,” Roth said. “I’m really supportive of it. I’ve been talking about Wesleyan and civic engagement and politically-active students since I returned to Wesleyan and people had been talking about it long before I came.” The committee, composed of Associate Provost Karen Anderson, Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) Director Frank Kuan, Director of Community Service and Volunteering Cathy Lechowicz, Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships Sonja Mañjon, Government Professor Don Moon, Director of Strategic Initiatives Charles Salas, Career Resource Center Director Michael Sciola, Rosenthal, and O’Connell, began developing a comprehensive program that originally included not only a certificate, but also hiring a new faculty member, funding for student internships, and extensive plans for community work with Long Lane Farm. “We planned a very elaborate, expensive program with multiple parts,  new professors, internships, but then the bottom fell out of the economy,” O’Connell said. “To save on the important components  we pared the CEC down to what we could do with no money. It’s still a fabulous endeavor and that’s the civic engagement proposal that’s gone to the EPC.” If the CEC is approved, a panel consisting of the Director of the Service Learning Center, the Director of Community Service and Volunteerism, the Director of Community Relations, and two other faculty members will administer the certificate. “We’re pretty much ready,” Rosenthal said. “It’s a work in progress, but I think the thing to do is to get it going through this gateway course and the formation of a committee that would be watching how it develops over the next couple years.” In December, Kathlyn Pattillo ’12 attended a meeting to give student input on the proposal. “My feeling is that they haven’t got very much student input,” Pattillo said. “And I voiced that in the meeting. I feel like moving forward they need to get students involved in the committee.” According to both Rosenthal and O’Connell, input from faculty and staff influenced the initial formation of the certificate far more than ideas from students. However, if the proposal is approved, ideas from students will take on a greater role in future development. “Once we figure out how the program goes, students will be involved in working to shape it,” O’Connell said. Regardless, Pattillo said she is pleased that the University is giving service-learning and civic engagement greater priority in academics. “I think it’s really great that the University is placing such an emphasis on service-learning,” Pattillo said. “Tufts has a major emphasis on public service already. I think this is a really positive step in that direction.” While the proposal was organized by staff and faculty, Rosenthal said the motivation came from students. “Just from students themselves, there’s a real desire for putting the whole thing together and thinking through issues: ethical questions, questions of the individual,” Rosenthal added. “These are things that are covered from time to time in different classes. The certificate program will allow [students] to engage [these things] in a body of thought.”"

		"title": "Three Years In, Roth Looks Back",
		"date": "2010-05-04",
		"authors": "by Jae Aron, Alison Cies, Editors-in-Chief",
		"content": "Argus: Do you think anything has changed about Wesleyan since you took over? President Roth: On the infrastructure side, there’s been a greater focus on economics and fiscal discipline, and there is a much greater emphasis on the long-term economic growth of the institution. There’s been a greater focus on what is distinctive about the Wesleyan educational experience. Over these past few years, I’ve been having conversations with faculty, students, and alumni about not just how strong we are as a school but what is particular about the Wesleyan educational experience that we cherish and want to preserve for future generations. That has allowed us to make some significant changes on the academic side, co-curricular side, and in the way we talk to alumni. Instead of celebrating the success and the strengths of the school, which we try to tease out from our own experiences of Wesleyan, we have been trying to look at what we think is characteristic of the personality of the institution and to strengthen these areas, such as creativity and political engagement. We’re trying to define how liberal arts can be made relevant to culture and society. I think we’ve made some progress as a result of those conversations. Here are a few examples: we’ve created the College of the Environment, we’ve enhanced our ability to do work in the community, and we’ve worked to make diversity not just a slogan but a more meaningful experience for Wesleyan students. We’ve also really worked on the way we do admissions and to try to celebrate what’s “Wesleyan-ish” about the place. A: Throughout your three years as President, you have introduced new ideas, new plans, and new ways of running the University. What are your goals for the future and is there a larger vision driving these changes? PR: We’ve had a series of conversations with student leaders, faculty, students, and alumni about the overarching goals of the Wesleyan 2020 plan. I hope the things I’ve articulated in that document build on the progressive legacy of the Butterfield years. Although we’ve set up the COE and the Center for the Study of Public Life during the year marking the fiftieth anniversary of the College of Letters, the College of Social Studies and the Center for the Humanities, I do think there’s a lot more than can be done. The vision is to champion curricular reform that enlivens the liberal arts while making it relevant to culture, society, and the economy, and promoting access to the institution from diverse quarters. In that regard I’ve emphasized   geographic diversity in addition to racial and ethnic diversity. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what Wesleyan stands for. In our history as a university we have taken stands that are progressive, and we know that because others have followed us. There’s a whole range of places where Wesleyan is an intellectual pioneer. Part of the vision I have for Wesleyan is that we should strive to always be pioneers. This will mean that sometimes we will fall into a trap or make a mistake because we have to take risks. That’s something about Wesleyan students, that they do take risks. Sometimes they fall, but it’s such a compassionate community that when people do fall, someone usually helps them up. A: How does your background as a scholar and former Wesleyan student inform your role as an administrator? PR: I think I come to my position with the perspective of a faculty member. The only administrative position that I’ve held at a college or university is that of president. As a faculty member, I was intensely suspicious of any administrator, and so I think I understand a healthy skepticism about any administration. I have tried to be as transparent as possible about what we do, especially in economic matters. Occasionally, there are serious issues of privacy that make it impossible to be as transparent as one would like to be. But on the whole, I think that faculty should be suspicious of administrators. My scholarly work also influences me, which may be for better or worse. My work is about how people make sense of the past. How you deal with memory, desire, trauma, and emotion. Here I am, back in the place where I went to college, which for me was an extraordinarily transformative experience. The person I was when I got here was very different from the person who graduated, in large part because of the teachers I had and the students I met. So for me coming back here is not just an administrative responsibility, but it’s a deeply emotional and intellectual responsibility because, after all, I work on how people deal with their past. The book I am completing this summer deals with issues of history and memory in French cultural history, as well as in teaching these subjects in the contemporary American university. My scholarly work has always been infused and informed by what I’ve been teaching. I always think of my work in as integrated a way as possible, and I try to keep it that way, even while being a university president. A: The recession has strained the University’s finances and forced the University to re-evaluate many of its plans. What has the recession taught you about running a University? How has the recession affected your priorities as President? PR: The recession has taught me that we must be extremely prudent in our use of resources that should in an institution like ours last forever. I think I began to see that necessity for prudence even before the recession hit, when we postponed the science building, but the recession showed us that we really needed to concentrate on our priorities. We did balance the budget, we did cut a lot of things, but we didn’t cut financial aid. The faculty and staff had a pay freeze and those of us at the top had a pay cut, but we didn’t have to have generalized layoffs. In fact we hired over 20 professors in the middle of the recession because we decided we would not cut corners in the curriculum. These hires will have a big impact on students. We also during this period started the Small Class Initiative and added dozens of small classes being taught by our regular faculty. The economic conditions of the last year have really shown me how important it is to be more disciplined about how we use resources we’re lucky enough to have. We have to save money for emergencies; we have put together reserves for contingencies. I don’t think the student experience has been negatively impacted by the cuts we’ve made, and I really want to make sure that that remains the case.  I joke with the alumni sometimes that when I came back to Wesleyan, I discovered that I am a fiscal conservative. Of all places to make that discovery, Wesleyan? But it’s true; I don’t like to spend money I don’t have. Some people said we should have a freeze on hiring, I said no, that would have meant fewer classes. We can’t afford to have fewer classes. We did receive a $1 million grant to start the small class initiative and we did go out and hire Amy Bloom. She’s a great writer who was teaching at Yale, lives nearby and would love to teach at Wesleyan. Happily, I could find a donor to pay for it. All this is to say that I think there are some really great things you can do in the middle of an economic recession as long as you’re really careful about how you spend money. A: Certainly as students, we find the day-to-day college experience to be quite unpredictable. What have you found to be most surprising in your three years as President? PR: The murder last year was by far the most shocking. The shock of the event itself and then the responsibility of trying to keep the campus as safe as possible while there was still a murderer at large was of course beyond surprising. And the compassion, and cooperation, and solidarity at Wesleyan and people outside of Wesleyan… I can’t say enough how proud I was by their generosity of spirit. So there was the surprise of horror and the surprise at how wonderful people can be. And then there are the surprises of being woken up at 3 a.m. and being asked to protect our students from the Middletown Police Department down on Fountain Avenue. Coming out in the middle of the night, and finding the street filled with drunken students and a TV camera was very surprising. I’ve also been to some just wonderful performances and even performed myself, which I never thought I would do in public. I’ve really enjoyed playing music here, and students have been so kind. Other surprises: The economic conditions at the University were surprising to me, but now we’ve got things in hand. And I was just surprised by how much attention people pay to the president. I didn’t do that when I was a student. It’s really surprising to me that people pay attention if I go the gym or walk Mathilde. I should add that people here have been so friendly most of the time; sometimes parents come up to me and complain about a grade I gave in my class, but that’s very infrequent (HA HA). A: What are you most proud of in your term as President and what would you have done differently? PR: I’m most proud of the leadership team’s response last year to the murder. I think we did our best, and that was the most important thing at that moment. Looking ahead, I’m really proud of how we’ve been able to put the university on a track to build the endowment through fundraising, rather than spend money through fundraising. That is an enormous shift in a difficult economic climate. I love the curriculum initiatives, the College of the Environment and creative writing. I think the heart of the school, you know I’m a nerd at heart, is the curriculum and in the end you reflect your values by what you teach. So strengthening the academic programs is really important to me. What do I wish I had done differently? I opened my mouth about too many things my first year and got myself in unnecessarily hot water. I created distractions by saying something in student life was stupid and The Argus ran with it because I really did say it. I said some things as if I knew the place better than I did. I did go here, but it was a long time ago. I’ve come to realize that I only knew a small part of Wesleyan—my friends, classes—and that was my world, but not all of Wesleyan. So I wish I had been a little more circumspect. I talk a lot, but like Wesleyan students, I’m willing to make mistakes. I don’t have a secret formula, I don’t do everything perfectly, so I try to make sure that I am respectful of others and clear in my reasoning. That’s the best I can do. I’m called upon to make many judgments: from big budget items to individual judicial cases. I don’t pretend to have the magic solution. I look at every case, and really think about it, so as to be as consistent and fair as possible. A: What are your plans for the year ahead? PR: Next year, we will continue to work on the things we’ve started. This will include civic engagement work, the internationalization of the student body, and changes in the curriculum. We will look for opportunities for partnerships with other institutions to extend the reach of the University with partners that make sense for us, whether they’re in China or Chicago. And the other thing we’ll do is we’ll stir the pot again, that is we’ll say, ‘OK, we did the College of the Environment, what’s the next big thing?” I think the curriculum should be constantly offering opportunities for innovation. There are faculty members who would like to see more classes that reach across more of the curriculum. I would also like to see us really build on our strengths. It’s a great university overall, and we attract wonderful students, and there are some places where I think lately we have really shined.  The film department, for example, is a program that is internationally recognized for its excellence as a small, but mighty crew. We can build on that. Our science programs are also internationally recognized. We will also invest in the sciences. We really want to make sure that although they are not getting a new building in the near future, we are investing in the equipment and the facilities so that students and faculty continue to do very high level research. In film, they go off to Hollywood and make movies, and in the sciences we also have stars go off to medical school, research careers and biotechnology firms, and I want to make sure we’re giving them the tools they need to be successful. We’re not giving them a brand new building, but we can invest in the sciences. There are opportunities to give the faculty more tools to expand their horizons and to build on the curriculum in ways that go beyond campus. The Albritton Center opened this year, as did the Shapiro writing center. I’m delighted that that building is now being used so well. And next year the squash courts will be under construction as we build a new home for the Career Resource Center, and the Art History and COL Departments. We may not be able to save MoCon but we can make something beautiful out of the old Squash Court Building. That’s something to celebrate."

		"date": "2010-09-07",
		"authors": "by Kennedy Odede,",
		"content": "I want to talk about Africa as an African. I’ve heard so much about the continent since I was a small child, and now that Africa figures prominently in debates as I pursue my studies in the United States, I feel my perspective is an important asset for understanding these debates, and working towards solutions based on the questions they pose. As you all know, Africa and its people have been used and exploited for centuries. Historians often say that history repeats itself. I agree that this is true when we look at how Africa has been treated for the past 200 years. Foreign interest in Africa started with explorations to discover Africa, which led to centuries of exploitation on a number of levels. Now, there is a new way of exploiting Africa: trips to the continent that grant visitors more opportunities than the locals. The work becomes trendy, something to flaunt to get internships and acclaim stateside. Many privileged young people come with the mentality that they want to “do something” to help change Africa. Many people publish books about Africa, as if they have the fortunate position of articulating the continent from a Western perspective, something the locals don’t have the affluence or time to do. Some people even go so far as to collect money by giving talks about Africa. These people are helping themselves in the name of helping Africa, feeding their own fantasies rather than facing the reality of Africa’s situation.  After publishing their articles, and making more and more money, these foreigners are invited into schools and colleges to give talks. If schools and colleges need someone to talk about Africa, I would encourage them to invite an African to talk about his or her experience in Africa. There is no way someone who visited Africa for less than a month will be able to start giving complex and accurate talks about the country. Furthermore, there is no one Africa, as it is composed of many countries, which in turn house a multitude of cultures. Africans are the best equipped to speak on behalf of Africa, and all of the diverse, culturally rich countries the continent contains. Africa for Africans is what I’d like to advocate for. It is a phrase used by Marcus Garvey, a man who died fighting for the liberty of African people. African problems will never be solved as long as many advantaged young people from the western hemisphere think that they can save the world, starting organizations or volunteering in Africa without a deep engagement or understanding of the communities they seek to improve. Without understanding the complex economic, social, and cultural issues involved, volunteers take advantage of the community, and in turn, the community takes advantage of volunteers for a quick fix, a tiny drop of money. This is not challenging the community to engage, and this is not challenging the volunteers. Money alone does nothing, and volunteering alone does little more. I want to cry when these shortsighted organizers talk about Africa, and how they are going to solve our problems. Some of these volunteers want to help Africa, but they can’t truly affect change through methods that do not involve full community engagement. Others do not really care about Africa at all, and come back to the Western world, get good jobs, and use their African experience for greedy purposes.  The reality is, not a single one of us, especially an outsider, is going to be responsible for solving the deep problems of a country, no matter how much we care about helping Africa. Africans can and must solve their own problems, but only if Africans are given access to partnerships and resources that were taken from them long ago, and are still being taken from them today. Africans also want the same media attention that the rich young westerners enjoy when they come back to their home country. I’m tired of seeing young privileged youth from the top universities given attention while the small people in the heart of Africa who are doing great change on the ground, both on their own and with outside volunteers, are not mentioned. I speak from my own experiences. I worked in Kibera slums for more than ten years. I was used by people from the outside, who didn’t want me to see anything good from Kibera. They wanted to continue glorifying poverty, but they never truly cared. They came with their own ideas of how they could save Kibera and I turned a blind eye to them. I know money cannot solve Kibera’s problems. I know a few organizations working in Kibera and based in America who waste their resources by paying outsiders to come and run their organizations in the slums. They have good networks that help them exploit the people on the ground, people who never read their glossy brochures.  This kind of organization will never help indigenous organizations. In fact, they feel threatened by the indigenous organizations, the people moving mountains without piles of money behind them. The rich western organizations only help by organizing sports tournaments for those in the slums. This perpetuates the idea that slum people are only capable of kicking around a soccer ball, but are incapable and undeserving of a serious education. Instead of spending thousands on “community-building exercises,” like soccer tournaments or discussions, build schools and hospitals that are actually accessible (unlike the ones that pretend to be open to everyone, but secretly raise the prices when the foreign donors get back on their planes). I’m writing from my own pain as a slum boy. We all know education is the only way out, but these organizations denied us education. They don’t want to engage the community, and they don’t want the communities to share their thoughts with them. I know they build hospitals in the slums, but they are all too expensive. When I founded a community organization in Kibera, some existing western organizations refused to cooperate with my organization. Even though many were not willing to work with me, there are a few organizations that believe in partnering with local communities to achieve their goals. For example, AFK exposed my organization internationally. If other organizations can be like that, then a lot can be done in Africa. But many organizations still try to help communities without engaging effectively with them. They craft ideas in the Western world, and pretend that those are Kibera people’s ideas. They pretend that the organization is run by the locals as a way to entice donors, when this is rarely the case! In fact, I’ve seen many organizations using Africans who are less educated as their partners to sing songs and stand as symbols of suffering. These same Africans are denied agency of power in that organization. They are being used in name in order for the organizations to get more grants. Any privileged person who wants to work for the poor must first respect them and treat them as equal partners. And they must know that poor people know their problem better than any outsiders ever will. But these kinds of projects, admirable in sentiment but insensitive in implementation, will not last for long. You can fool the locals for a moment, but you can’t fool them forever, and one day they will stand up for their rights. They will stand with good friends of humanity all over the world who want to spearhead change from the ground level. This is why I founded Shining Hope For Communities with my partner Jessica Posner: to create an organization that rejects the ineffective principles I have described above, and truly works with local communities to arrive at effective, long-lasting solutions. We are both equal partners in the organization, and bring different insights and experiences to our work. I bring my experience living in Kibera for twenty-three years, while Jessica brings her detail oriented, managerial skills. Our projects are also being prepared from the ground, where I grew up, and our goal in America is to find the resources to help implement the projects that the community has decided on. It must be said, though, that our work is not possible without the guidance, advice, and support from our board members and partners, who bring immense aptitude to the organization. My hope is that Shining Hope For Communities will help transform what it means to be a charity organization in a developing nation, and prove that problems in such countries can be more effectively and positively dealt with by constantly working with local communities in true, 50-50 partnerships. However, I know that I am not changing the world. In fact, I would urge people to try and restrain from using that phrase, as no one can change the world. It is too big a place. But I know that all of us, both outside volunteers and locals, can work together to positively impact society one community at a time."

		"title": "A Wesleyan Introduction to Middletown’s Historic Past",
		"date": "2010-09-17",
		"authors": "by Laura Munsil, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "When students arrived on campus this semester, Middletown residents pulled out all the stops. Signs screaming “Welcome Back, Wes Students!” hung in the windows of local businesses, along with loud banners advertising student discounts and acceptance of Wesleyan’s Middletown Cash system.  Although relations between Wesleyan and Middletown have been tenuous at times, they have shared a rich and complicated history for almost 200 years.  Europeans first settled the area now known as Middlesex County in 1650, and the community that sprung up was named Middletown for its placement between Windsor and the mouth of the Connecticut River. The early government, like most in New England, was harsh, boasting fourteen crimes punishable by death including the “incorrigible stubbornness of children,” according to the City of Middletown website. The colonization of the area took years, largely because of Native American activity led by the infamous chieftain Sowheag. By the time of American independence, however, Middletown was the largest and wealthiest town in Connecticut, partially because of its deepwater harbor. The Industrial Revolution also did wonders for Middletown. According to Deborah Shapiro, member of the Middlesex Historical Society, at least one object was produced in Middletown for each letter of the alphabet. Today, Middletown still deals heavily in manufacturing. Its largest employer is Pratt & Whitney, which mainly makes aircraft engines. Wesleyan University opened in Middletown in 1831.  A group of men, led by Willbur Fisk, had the goal of advancing education and Methodist doctrine in New England.  “Methodists were well-known for education at that time,” Shapiro said. Middletown was already 180 years old in 1831, but it had fallen on hard economic times in the years leading up to Wesleyan’s establishment. It was a town of muddy streets and frame houses and still had a public whipping post.  However, there was much to be said for its beauty. John Quincy Adams, on a presidential visit, called Middletown “the most beautiful of all (the Connecticut towns).”  Charles Dickens is also rumored to have called High Street, a street of luxurious mansions, the most beautiful street in the Americas.  Several other towns in Connecticut contested to house the University, hoping to become successful college towns like New Haven and Hartford. Middletown won out and on September 21, 1831, 48 male students matriculated as the University’s first class. Following Wesleyan’s establishment, Middletown experienced an economic boom. It even boasted a major league baseball team in 1872, when the Middletown Mansfields took the field against other major league teams of the era.  In the years since 1831, Middletown and Wesleyan have worked on creating a closer relationship. While rocky town-gown relations have created conflicts in recent years, students and the Middletown community have been working on bridging the gap.  Wesleyan students volunteer at the Green Street Arts Center and mentor children from the North End, and Middletown residents are invited to cultural and arts events on campus. “On a personal note, I’ve always seen the influence of Wesleyan on Middletown as a positive one,” Shapiro said. Wesleyan students tread daily on legendary ground: the ground of Sowheag, General Mansfield, and countless others. Although the campus may at times feel like a sequestered Wesleyan bubble, it is important to remember the myriad ways Middletown’s heritage has shaped the University, and that going to parties on the most beautiful street in the Americas is a privilege, indeed."

		"title": "10/10/10 in Middletown: Students Hit Streets to Fight Climate Change",
		"date": "2010-10-13",
		"authors": "by Sydney Lewis, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "On Sunday, 12 student volunteers celebrated “10/10/10,” the climate work party that took place across the globe, by going door-to-door in Middletown neighborhoods to provide information about subsidized weatherization programs available to Connecticut residents. The event, held on Oct. 10, 2010 (hence the title 10/10/10), was hosted by 350.org, an international campaign dedicated to raising awareness and creating solutions for the climate crisis. According to 350.org, the 10/10/10 campaign became one of the biggest days of environmental action in history, with over 7,000 events occurring across 188 countries to address the issue of climate change. Groups around the world planted trees, installed solar panels and stoves, and repaired bicycles, among many other projects. In comparison, the last 350.org event on Oct. 24, 2010 only had 5,000 events. “It was a historic day,” said 10/10/10 participant Dan Fischer ’12. “It was called the most widespread day of civic engagement ever and it was important that Wesleyan students were involved. Events happened in every country in the world except for four.” Wesleyan’s 10/10/10 project was coordinated by Matthew Lichtash ’13 and Evan Weber ’13 through the Wesleyan chapter of Connecticut Students for a Just and Stable Future partnered with The Jonah Center for Earth and Art, a local non-profit organization that works to preserve ecologically significant areas in Middletown. On Sunday, Wesleyan students knocked on an estimated 350 doors of Middletown residents to encourage them to participate in home energy efficiency improvement programs offered by The Jonah Center. “We thought it would be a great program to try to promote in Middletown and would be a good way to spend 10/10/10,” Weber said. The two programs, Home Energy Solutions (HES) and Weatherization Residential Assistance Partnership (WRAP), bring in private contractors to help improve efficiency in Middletown homes. The contractors are hired by the state of Connecticut, which collaborates with The Connecticut Energy Efficiency Fund, The North End Action Team, Connecticut Light and Power, The New England Conservation Services, and The Jonah Center. Technicians will check insulation, wrap pipes, check and seal leaks in doors, windows, and ducts, inspect efficiency of appliances, and install energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs. These services will save homeowners about $250 annually and improve air quality in Middletown. Although the services can usually cost between $500 and $1600, homeowners are only required to pay a $75 fee to participate in HES. If residents’ income is below a specified amount, they may qualify to participate in WRAP, which is a free program. “I was overjoyed with the few people who showed up [to campaign],” Weber said. “It is very difficult to motivate people to do things outside of themselves. Those who participated commented how nice it was to actually get up and out into the community to help people live better lives and take concrete action towards preserving the state of the planet for future generations.” Of the hundreds of homes the volunteers stopped by, they only gave out forms to about 50—mostly because many people didn’t answer the door. According to Fischer, most people they spoke to were open to the idea. “People were very friendly and definitely receptive,” Fischer said. “We were frankly offering them a pretty good deal. They were happy to know that we were volunteers and out for a good cause and that they would save on their electricity bill as a result.” Some residents, however, were less receptive than others. “One woman actually said that she didn’t want to change the status quo, which is weird,” Lichtash said. “But the majority of people were nice and took the forms.” Another woman who opened the door called the Middletown Police after threatening two volunteers, alleging that they needed a permit to solicit and knock on doors. When a police officer rolled through the neighborhood 10 minutes later, the students only had to show their identification before they were allowed to continue down the block. Not deterred by these few surprising encounters, the students hope to continue the campaign by working to weatherize University professors’ houses. The University has pledged to pay the $75 fee for each professor, so the group is working on getting more professors involved in the program. The group also has plans to expand beyond Middletown. “We’re going to continue outreach on weatherization in addition to working on shutting down the Bridgeport Coal Plant,” Fischer said."

		"title": "“9500 Liberty”",
		"date": "2011-03-01",
		"authors": "by Sarah P. Cassel, Class of 2013,",
		"content": "This past weekend I went to the screening of the movie “9500 Liberty,” a documentary about immigration in Prince William County, Va. The movie illustrates how elected officials within the county were pressured by residents to adopt an “Immigrant Resolution,” which allowed police officers to question any individual they had “probable cause” to believe was an illegal immigrant. The resolution ultimately was overturned, but not before Prince William County received national attention for its role in the dramatic immigration debate.  The directors of the documentary, Annabel Park and Eric Byler, were present at the screening, staying late to address questions about the film and political activism in general. During the question-answer session, Annabel spoke about the need to “break down fences” that separate people from engaging in meaningful, knowledge-seeking dialogue. She spoke of the importance of developing political opinions based on substantive facts as opposed to on stories concocted with an agenda in mind. The theory was to reframe discussions so that they are no longer arguments between “us” and “them,” but rather dialectics that are aimed at approaching greater truth. As I listened to Annabel, I thought of Jürgen Habermas’ discursive theory, which promotes civic engagement within society to develop public policy. Habermas’ vision is of active political participation by citizens to generate informed ideas regarding the desired direction of the state. In this view, every individual has equal worth, and thus equal say, in the formation of new societal procedures so that their realization will benefit everyone. The downfall of this theory is twofold: first, that it relies upon eventual consensus, and second, it does not carry enough intrinsic political power to force agreed-upon policies to be implemented. Dialogue is useful for challenging people’s basic assumptions and promoting an atmosphere of learning, but in order for it to have any practical consequences, it must involve legislative power. Therefore, the discursive theory must articulate its objective as attempting to enlist individuals in the rumination of ideas so as to create an informed citizenry that is able to engage in democracy from a politically knowledgeable standpoint.  In order for these civil discussions to be effectively actualized, every individual must come to them with a “Will to Truth”—a sincere desire to gain knowledge and create shared experiences with others that will ultimately inform one’s personal social and political opinions. In Plato’s Apology, in which Socrates defends himself in the Athenian court on charges associated with practicing philosophy, Socrates serves as the apotheosis of a character with the Will to Truth. His entire persona is one of constant questioning with an insatiable desire to learn and understand, though at the same time he is wise in that he recognizes what he does not know and does not claim to know it. The principle illustrated is that we should never be so confident as to believe that, in our pursuit of truth, we actually have it, for our quest merely brings us closer through the constant addition of levels of nuance to the situation. Developing the Will to Truth requires deliberation, commitment, and introspection, and we must be willing to admit that we do not know.  Annabel and Eric’s mission in creating the film “9500 Liberty” was to cast a shadow of doubt on the assumptions held by many residents of Prince William County who equated the presence of illegal immigrants in their community with harmful consequences, such as higher crime rates. While this popular theory had no empirical basis, it was constructed by long-time residents of the county as a façade to hide a deep insecurity caused by the quickly changing culture of the neighborhood. It is important to note that those people did not have malicious intentions—they merely felt that their way of live was being threatened and it demanded protection from the change.  Everyone wants to be heard and to be taken seriously. We all would like for our opinions to matter and for actions to be undertaken in accordance with our values. It is for this reason that a discursive-theory style dialogue, guided by the Will to Truth, is necessary to promote meaningful civic political involvement. Everyone engaging in dialogue must not only participate with a personal desire to gain greater understanding, but also with the recognition that others are doing the same. We need not accept every viewpoint as moral, or even as valid, but it is imperative to see the bit of truth that motivates each opinion so that we may explore the pieces that collectively form a slightly more complete picture of the truth."

		"title": "Support the CPE Re-Approval",
		"date": "2011-03-01",
		"authors": "by Katherine Eyster,",
		"content": "After a successful and inspiring four semesters, the Center for Prison Education pilot program at Cheshire Correctional is up for re-approval. After faculty assessment, the proposed five year expansion plan was approved by the Educational Policy Committee last week; it now faces an all-faculty vote on March 1. Those involved in the program have every reason to be confident and proud. To ensure its passage, I am asking you, the student body, to lend your voice to this critical cause. As outlined in its mission statement, the goal of the CPE is: “To advance Wesleyan’s commitment to civic engagement by offering college courses to incarcerated individuals, in order both to enrich the lives of those who are systematically denied access to educational opportunities and to enhance Wesleyan’s academic community.” For the past two years, the most meaningful work that I have done has been within prison walls. As a workshop leader and tutor, I have found community, inspiration, and insight among a peer group that I otherwise would have never known. I entered Wesleyan eager to push my boundaries and challenge my assumptions, but looking back over my four years at this University, I never could have imagined the remarkable outcome of this pursuit. The Wesleyan students at Cheshire prove daily their commitment to the program and to their education. They are committed to protecting and promoting the group before their own interests. When decisions are being made, they never hesitate to consider how these decisions might affect other Wesleyan students and future inmates who might seek to enroll in Wesleyan’s Center for Prison Education. They are curious, they are respectful, and they are committed. Their enthusiasm is inspiring. They have found an immensely positive focus on talent, compassion and teamwork that might otherwise be wasted or lost altogether.  I share this to affirm that what is being accomplished encompasses, yet goes far beyond service learning and civic engagement. This program, quite simply, is changing lives. The five-year proposal includes enrolling new cohorts at Cheshire and expanding to York Correctional, the women’s facility, in 2012.  The inmates, once admitted, enroll in two courses a semester, taught by Wesleyan faculty who receive a stipend for their work. All of the money to run the program is raised privately and does not come from the University. Students are involved in the program as writing tutors and teaching assistants. Students also volunteer at three correctional facilities as workshop leaders, college prep tutors, and classroom assistants. You can find out more at: www.wesleyan.edu/cpe. It is an exceptional program, one that students founded, and one that students, alumni, professors, and the students at Cheshire are committed to seeing through. If you care, let your professors know: send them an email, stop by their office hours, write them a letter, or catch them after class. This is one of few student initiatives to become part of the structure, and indeed mission, of the University. Help us make sure that the momentous student support is not overlooked or undersold. Encourage your professors to vote in support of the program at the faculty meeting on March 1.    Eyster is a member of the class of 2010 and a Ford Fellow."

		"title": "Students, Professors, and Middletown Residents Unite in 5K for Brighter Dawns",
		"date": "2011-04-15",
		"authors": "by Kimberly Muellers,",
		"content": "On Saturday, April 16, crowds of high school seniors will be arriving at Wesleyan University, eager to see the college, professors, and classmates with whom they will spend their next four years. Amidst the excitement, many of these accepted students will be lining up, along with current Wesleyan students, faculty, and runners from all across Middlesex County, at the starting line of the 5K for Brighter Dawns. While their peers play Frisbee or sleep into the afternoon, these active students will run 3.1 miles to support the residents of a slum in Khalishpur, Khulna, Bangladesh, many of whom must walk for miles each day to collect water for their families. In the Summer of 2010, Tasmiha Khan, a Wesleyan junior, founded Brighter Dawns to improve health in underprivileged communities in Bangladesh. After spending a summer treating diabetes in a slum in Bangladesh, Khan realized that in order to prevent the high levels of disease that occurred in the area, the residents would first need access to clean water and education on personal hygiene, two essential things that were almost completely absent there. Under Khan’s guidance, Brighter Dawns raises money to provide these necessities. The organization, which began as a student group at Wesleyan and recently became a non-profit, will build 30 latrines and 10 wells in a slum in Khalishpur, and provide 1,000 sanitary kits to households in the area. Additionally, Brighter Dawns will hire three local women as community health officers and will train them to monitor the wells and latrines and to educate the community in sanitary practices. This unique, comprehensive approach will hopefully establish sustainable reductions in disease and improvements in overall quality of life throughout the community. Next weekend, Brighter Dawns will take its vision of community engagement to Middletown, offering Wesleyan students and Middletown residents the much-needed opportunity for social interaction. As these two groups, which coexist within the same area yet have retained an air of separation in the past, join together and run, they will also be supporting another community that neither has met before. “The 5K for Brighter Dawns Event…aims to bring together the greater Middletown community and beyond to help bring clean water to a slum in Bangladesh,” explains Jason Lee, a Wesleyan junior and the Development Director of Brighter Dawns. Symbolizing this cooperation between their communities will be the mayor of Middletown, Sebastian Giuliano, and the president of Wesleyan University, Michael Roth. The mayor will deliver an introduction to the event at 10:30 a.m., and the race itself, attended by President Roth and family, will begin at 10:30 a.m. in Middletown, Conn. Participants of all ages and fitness levels are welcome to walk, jog, or run in the event, and water will be available for all. Prizes will be awarded to the top three finishers. Following the race, Wesleyan’s Interfaith Justice League, the co-sponsor of the 5K for Brighter Dawns, will continue the theme of unity with a Better Together Interfaith Brunch, where 5K participants and the public will be treated to free food and a discussion on the meaning of “interfaith.” The brunch, catered by Brew Baker’s, will begin at 11 a.m. and continue until 1 p.m. in Allbritton 311, 222 Church Street, Middletown, CT. “The 5K event is also…an attempt to bring people of different religious or spiritual traditions to work together for a common cause, in response to a challenge put forth by President Obama earlier in March on inter-religious collaboration,” explains Carmen Yip, a member of Brighter Dawns and organizer of the Interfaith brunch. “Different religious communities in Wesleyan are invited and encouraged to take this opportunity…to continue these dialogues on why we serve our society, and more specifically, the Brighter Dawns water project. The brunch will also be a celebration of the various accomplishments and efforts achieved by the religious communities and the interfaith group this year.” By promoting unity and healthy activity in the local community, Brighter Dawns wishes to give something back to their supporters who, through their generosity, are bringing hope to a community abroad. For more information or to pre-register for the 5K, please visit http://www.brighterdawns.org/5k-run-sign-up, or email improve@brighterdawns.org.    Muellers is the Brighter Dawns Communications Director."

		"content": "Wesleyan students gather for 350.org event in New Haven. (Rachel Rosengard/Contributing Photographer) Students and residents of the greater Middletown area gathered on Main Street on Saturday, Sept. 24 for “Moving Earth Day,” with the goal of raising awareness and enthusiasm for a movement away from fossil fuels. The global event was organized by environmental advocacy group 350.org. Several members of the Environmental Organizer’s Network (EON) spearheaded campus and local activities in collaboration with Middletown residents. On Saturday morning outside the Church of the Holy Trinity on Main Street, members of EON set up a series of booths, each highlighting a different facet of on campus sustainability efforts such as the WILD Wes landscaping project and WesFRESH. Members of EON collaborated with Middletown community leaders, and the event included representation by local businesses and organizations such as the Oddfellows Playhouse, Middletown Art Farm, and Pedal Power Bicycle Shop. EON Coordinator Oliver James ’14, one of the day’s principal organizers, said that he was struck by the conversations he witnessed between Wesleyan students and members of the Middletown community. “[The day] really just reveals the importance of community engagement and extending our conversation and our alliances beyond the University level to the greater Middletown-wide community,” he said. “[From the] people that came up to us, we would get into these amazing conversations about a resource that they could provide to us or some reason that they were excited about what we were doing on campus or vice versa.”   Francesca Moree jumps hopscotch at Moving Planet Day. (Rachel Rosengard/Contributing Photographer)   EON Outreach Chair Manon LeFevre ’14 said that the event highlighted the sustainability efforts of Middletown residents. In an email to The Argus, she cited one woman she met with two bee hives in her attic that she hopes to donate to Long Lane Farm, and another resident who is planting a roof garden next spring on top of the Community Health Center. “By talking to people that were there, we discovered really valuable resources that we never knew about,” she wrote. “It was really inspiring to see how our environmental projects and efforts on campus can have a much broader reach, and it made us realize that we don’t see much of that on campus. I can safely say it’s definitely something we’re going to get working on.” Following the morning on Main Street, a caravan of students traveled to New Haven for a larger rally organized by the Connecticut branch of 350.org. There, according to James, festivities included addresses from the mayor of New Haven and representatives from local New Haven sustainability initiatives. Participants also spelled out “350” in huge numbers on the New Haven green—the ideal number of carbon dioxide parts per million in the atmosphere for global environmental sustainability. “People all across the world did the same,” he said. “The symbolic action was just really powerful.” According to James, Wesleyan students were one of the largest contingencies of college students at the New Haven event, which drew students from Yale University, Connecticut College, and Fairfield University. After the rally, James said Wesleyan representatives met with representatives from Yale’s environmental sustainability group, the Yale Student Environmental Coalition (YSEC). “That organization sort of took us under their wing and after the event concluded, we were invited to come socialize, network, and throw down with members of YSEC,” he said. “It was a recognition of the potential to just really collaborate on issues and increase dialogue between university campuses in Connecticut with issues pertaining to sustainability and the environment.” EON Coordinator Zach Attas ’13 said that the live stream on the Moving Earth Day website of other celebrations across the globe created an exciting sense of unity. “You’d see a photo from Cairo, Egypt, where there are hundreds of people marching, and they’re all wearing the same thing and holding up signs and getting really excited,” he said. “You’d see people from all the ends of the Earth [rallying] together.”"

		"title": "Civic Engagement Certificate Encourages Community Involvement",
		"date": "2011-11-03",
		"authors": "by Isabel Rouse, Assistant Features Editor",
		"content": "Spanning a diverse range of majors and disciplines, including chemistry, biology, religion, sociology, government, film, and theater, the new Civic Engagement Certificate (CEC) already boasts 23 fall courses and 19 spring courses cross-listed in the Civic Engagement program. “We’re trying to integrate practical experience of civic activity in volunteer work and internships with academic work, giving students a critical and reflective distance on their practical activities,” said Professor Donald Moon, Ezra and Cecile Zilkha Professor in the College of Social Studies. “Most Wesleyan students participate in some form of civic engagement. The Certificate is designed for students who want to understand the role of engagement in a democracy.” According to the University website, the CEC is much like the more established certificates, in that it enables students to attain a greater degree of curricular coherence than would otherwise be possible. “It provides information about how they could pursue that interest by indicating what courses they should take, and the extracurricular activities such as volunteering that they should consider,” Moon said. The University has long attempted to create an atmosphere that encourages a strong social consciousness and participation in a variety of formal and informal civic activities. According to the University’s website, civic engagement involves activities that allow individuals to strengthen their communities. “These activities include volunteer work, practica, and service-learning courses,” the website states. “This certificate is designed for students interested in reflecting upon and integrating their civic and academic efforts.” Moon believes that the Certificate will help influence the larger University community, even if only a handful of students take explicit advantage of the new opportunity. “We hope to enable students who are committed to civic engagement to pursue a course of study and related activities that would enhance their capacity to engage in civic life in an effective and thoughtful way,” Moon said. “One of Wesleyan’s great strengths is its engagement with the world, and this program is yet another way in which we can fulfill this aspect of our institutional mission.” The Certificate is also closely linked with the Service-Learning course cluster, which integrates experiences outside the classroom with an academic curriculum taught in a classroom setting. “Civic engagement involves bringing attention to the voices of individuals who might otherwise not be heard by the larger society,” said Professor of Theater Ronald Jenkins, who teaches two prison outreach theater classes within the Service-Learning course cluster. The Certificate entails several requirements: a sophomore year foundation course, at least five courses related to civic engagement, a minimum of 40 hours of service work, a practicum, and a senior seminar. One of the best examples of courses offered within the certificate is the prison outreach course THEA205, Prison Outreach Through Theater. The course, which is taught by Professor of Theater Ron Jenkins, brings together students and incarcerated adults to explore and perform texts written by incarcerated individuals. “I became involved in the program through the Service-Learning Program, where I taught courses demonstrating how theater can be experienced as a catalyst for social change,” Jenkins said. “My experience with the transformative power of theater came when I was incarcerated in South Africa while researching performances staged as protests against apartheid. In an absurdly overcrowded cell, I was astonished to see how they defied the injustice of their imprisonment by transforming it into a celebration of resistance to apartheid, performing protest songs, dances and satirical humor.” Civic engagement has long been a focus of the University, so the program is not altogether revolutionary or without foundation. President Roth made social dedication a key strategy in “Wesleyan 2020: A Framework for Planning” through the creation of the Civic Engagement Committee. This committee suggests methods of expanding engagement opportunities, and one of the outgrowths of this committee is the newly founded Certificate. Professor Jenkins sees the implications of this course as reaching far beyond anything exclusive to the University. “Giving voice to this voiceless population is one of the ways that civic engagement can contribute to social change,” Jenkins said. “When Wesleyan students perform the writings of incarcerated individuals with incarcerated individuals, they are expanding the boundaries of civic engagement beyond the confines of the course and contributing to the transformation of attitudes, which is a necessary step towards the transformation of society.”"

		"date": "2011-11-07",
		"authors": "by Olivia Horton, Campus Coordinator of Wesleyan Democracy Matters, Argus News Editor, Class of 2014",
		"content": "As this week’s Middletown municipal elections spark debate about voter rights, and Occupy Wall Street protesters across the nation call for limits on corporate power, the need for electoral reform becomes increasingly apparent. Dissatisfied citizens are uniting around a desire for increased political accountability, the removal of big money from politics, and a return to popular sovereignty. The Occupy movement has effectively raised awareness and encouraged support for these demands, but the time has come to focus our efforts and utilize existing organizations and mechanisms to enact change. As President of the Wesleyan Chapter of Democracy Matters, I propose that we channel the energy of the Occupy movement into the pursuit of campaign finance reform. This is a tangible goal that would help solve many of the problems of corruption and inappropriate corporate influence within our political system. Clean and fair elections offer an alternative to the current methods of campaign finance and returns to a government that is by the people and for the people. A system of publicly funded elections would encourage politicians to appeal to average citizens whose political voice might otherwise be drowned out by donations from a rich minority. Rather than allowing officials to seek large campaign donations from extremely wealthy individuals or from large corporations, the reformed system would require politicians to seek broader constituent support. Politicians who demonstrate a certain level of support and agree to operate within such a system would limit donations received from special interests in exchange for additional government funding for their campaign. This allows politicians to truly represent their constituency as a whole, instead of the select few who can afford to fund their election. Once in office, representatives will not be obligated to cater to special interests or corporations that have the ability to offer significant campaign donations. Electoral reform would loosen the grip that corporations currently have on public officials due to the regrettable importance of money in campaigns. Politicians could truly hold corporations accountable for their actions without the fear of losing their means of re-election. The demands of the average citizen would hold actual political weight, and it would be in the interest of representatives to pay attention to these demands, regardless of the size of the citizen’s wallet. The removal of big money from politics increases the influence of citizens and represents a return to popular sovereignty. Our current system is tainted by the corrupt influence of corporations who are immune from political consequences because public officials are dependent on their campaign donations. If citizens want to exercise a true voice in elections and policy making, they first need to destroy this roadblock to democracy. The recent efforts to fight for the right of Wesleyan students to vote in Middletown represents a commitment to political accountability and a desire to have an impact on local governance. These aspirations would be aided by campaign finance reform, which allows true equality in the voting process regardless of individual wealth. If the wealthy few continue to be allowed a disproportionate amount of influence within the government, then voter registration drives and other forms of civic engagement may ultimately be irrelevant in our political reality. Important steps have been taken in the past few months to further political engagement and raise awareness about wealth inequality and corporate influence. However, in order for real shifts in power to occur, changes must be made within the political system with regards to how we elect our officials. Representatives must truly be made accountable to the people through the public financing of elections. The passion for change clearly exists among the American people and it is time to progress from a vocalization of this passion to tangible objectives. The goal of a government truly beholden to citizens is well within reach, especially if we utilize the resources of organizations like Democracy Matters to educate others and advocate for reform."

		"title": "Middletown Lingerie Store Proves a Good Fit",
		"date": "2012-02-27",
		"authors": "by Theodora Messalas, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "This past windy Saturday afternoon, I set out with an Anonymous Correspondent (a female friend who prefers to remain unnamed) to peruse the racks of Main Street’s own Tina’s Fine Lingerie and Swimwear. After spending the past month oscillating between libraries, dining halls, and our residence halls, a fun shopping outing seemed like the perfect solution to the February blues.  And what better way to brighten my day than with a new set of lingerie? We made our way down to Main Street à la Clueless, finally stopping in front of the purple storefront populated by confidently-posed, lingerie-clad mannequins. The styles they model ranged from bra-and-panty sets to racier items like costumes and negligees. We were apprehensive, faced with a quandary that many young women must confront when choosing their intimates: how can one straddle (pun intended) the line between sexy and outlandish? We entered cautiously, but once we got to the racks of chiffon, satin, and lace, we searched them eagerly and our worries were absolved. The small space is intimate but alive with color and fabric, almost as if it were a performer’s closet.  Painted in the same purple jewel tone as the storefront, the store’s interior is divided into two sides, one for lingerie and one for swimsuits, with clothing rising toward the ceiling on both sides. The number of items is exciting, but potentially overwhelming given the layout; my Anonymous Correspondent and I were sure, despite our best efforts to thoroughly canvas the store, that we missed some things. Saleswoman and partial owner Tina Lun approached us as we browsed. Well-coiffed, but clad in a navy hooded sweatshirt, she looked as if she was showing us around her own closet. She proved an indispensable resource for figuring out size, fit, and even style. As my Anonymous Correspondent picked out a fire-engine-red babydoll (which is a sexy, sometimes see-through minidress with a built-in bra) and held it against herself, Ms. Lun quickly spotted that it was the wrong size and pointed her toward the babydoll she would ultimately buy, a black one with pink trim. “I’m very good [at helping customers],” Lun said. “I have to know what you like. There’s a certain taste for it. If you tell me what you want, I’ll be able to get it for you.” Her sharp eye proved not only helpful, but also necessary for sifting through all of the options available in the store. There were costumes (sexy nurse, sexy priest, and an elaborate sexy ’50s waitress costume), floor-length see-through nightgowns, swimsuits, corsets, and chemises with clasps hanging from their hems, presumably to connect to a thigh-high stocking or garter. Equally impressive was a display in the middle of the racks that touted massage oils, lubricants, sex toys, and other items intended to enhance the sexual experience. The store seemed unabashed in its commitment to the pleasure of its patrons. “I like helping people look pretty and walk out smiling because…they’re gonna have some fun later, right?” Lun said. Tina’s Fine Lingerie and Swimwear opened on Feb. 2, 1997, and is in its fifteenth year on Main Street. We learned that many a University student before us has come to the shop in search of some element of fantasy. My Anonymous Correspondent and I would have preferred if more space had been allotted for more simple items, but we both found great and very affordable bras and underwear from among the choices. I ended up buying a striking red bra with black trim and a few other lovely, lacy underpinnings, all for under $40. My Anonymous Correspondent walked out equally satisfied with the black babydoll and a subtly gothic purple bra sheathed in black lace. As we were checking out, Ms. Lun chatted with us about Wesleyan. “A lot of Wesleyan students come in for occasions,” she said. “You guys have a lot of parties. The Halloween party is big—you’re all here. And you guys have other stuff like sex parties.” We countered that lingerie parties are actually more common now, looking pointedly at our wares. She laughed and wrapped our items in pretty blue and gold paper sleeves. In fact, as a thank-you to her University customers, she is offering 10% off any purchase to students who mention this article. We were disappointed by the somewhat limited selection of bras and underwear—the more accessible lingerie items for college students—but we ultimately found Tina’s Fine Lingerie and Swimwear to be a great shopping experience. The store was inviting and bold, and we recommend it highly to Wes students looking to add a bit of flair to their undergarments, and their weekend soirees. Tina’s Fine Lingerie and Swimwear is located at 394 Main Street and online at www.tinasfinelingerie.com."

		"title": "Green Party Presidential Candidate Jill Stein Comes to Middletown",
		"date": "2012-03-05",
		"authors": "by Lily Baggott, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "Last Thursday, Presidential candidate Jill Stein came to Middletown. The Wesleyan College Greens, a student group dedicated to Green Party politics, arranged for her to give a talk at the First Church of Christ on Court Street. Ross Levin ’15 founded the campus chapter of College Greens this past fall. Since then, the group has brought several speakers to campus, including the Green Party candidate for Sheriff of Philadelphia Cheri Honkala, the Green Party 2004 presidential candidate David Cobb, and most recently Stein. According to Levin, Stein is most likely to become the Green Party’s official presidential candidate, but the Party still faces challenges to getting her name on the ballot. “It’s also the start of a state-wide ballot access drive,” Levin noted. “The Jill Stein event will be the formal launch of the petition drive.” According to Levin, Democrats and Republicans are usually guaranteed placement on the ballot in most states, but third parties are required to obtain signatures to get on the ballot. Because of this, the Green Party must go from state to state gathering support and signatures to get on the ballot. Levin noted that Pennsylvania requires a large number of signatures to get candidates on the ballot and that the number of signatures required varies by state. “[Pennsylvania is] one extreme,” he said. “Connecticut falls kind of in the middle but more toward Pennsylvania than towards the freer states.” This year, the party needs to collect a minimum of 7,500 signatures in Connecticut. According to Levin, they have set a goal of 12,000 signatures. College Greens members plan to go around campus and Middletown, collecting signatures for their ballot access drive. “We’re going to be doing this ballot access drive, [so] I am sure you’ll see us around campus collecting signatures to get Jill Stein on the ballot,” Levin said. “There’s also this state Senate candidate that we’ll be helping. So I think what we’re also going to try to do is use those two campaigns, for a lack of a better word, to build the College Greens as an interminable presence.” He also noted that the goal of College Greens is different from the goals of other political student groups on campus. “If you’re going to compare us to Wesleyan Democrats, our focus is different,” Levin said. “It’s more like raising awareness that the Green Party is a viable option, rather than this kind of ‘helping out the machine’ that the Wesleyan Democrats do.” Although the group will be working with specific political candidates, College Greens member Dan Goldman ’12 and Levin both stressed that the goal of the group is to spread awareness and education about alternative political parties. “Knowing that there is an alternative is a really powerful thing,” Goldman said. Jill Stein ran for governor in Massachusetts in 2002 and 2010 and other state government positions in the past several years. Her talk on Thursday focused on her “Green New Deal,” which addresses global warming and financial crises. Her talk also addressed the Green Party’s views on legalizing marijuana, ending the war, eliminating student debt, and helping the economy. “I think these are issues which a lot of people on this campus would agree with,” College Greens member Jeremy Keim-Shenk ’12 noted. After the talk, she held a question-and-answer session where many students and Middletown residents inquired further about her policies and asked about the controversial third party “spoiling” of the vote. Afterwards, she went around the Usdan University Center and spoke to students. “I would just say that this is your ballpark,” Stein said when asked what her message to students is. “This is your challenge, and this is your opportunity to create the kind of world that you really need. It’s falling apart right now on your shoulders, and this campaign is a chance to create an alternative that really is about you. It’s of, by, and for you and the future.” With about 65 people in attendance, Levin and Keim-Shenk were slightly disappointed with the student turnout. “Overall, I would say I think it was fairly successful,” Keim-Shenk said. “We were maybe hoping for a few more students, but given that it wasn’t on campus and given that it was snowing, it was all right.” Levin also noted that he hopes that this event and the College Greens’ general presence on campus will involve younger people in the Green Party. “One of the reasons I have felt so good about investing so much energy in this event is that it’s a way to promote activism on campus,” Levin said. “My hope is that people will be brought into the fold of civic engagement.” The event was held at the First Church of Christ in Middletown, in part to broaden its scope, according to Levin. “We also wanted to make this more of a Middletown-wide event and Connecticut-wide event, rather than just Wesleyan,” Levin stated. Levin and the College Greens have been working closely with Middletown resident Vittorio (Vic) Lancia, a local Green Party supporter. Lancia has been involved in Green Party efforts in Middletown for about ten years, according to Levin. “I’m hoping this [event] is something to get things cooking in Middletown and to kick off Jill Stein’s campaign and also the energy of the students,” Lancia said. “I’ve been able to connect with the students because there’s nothing going on [in Middletown], so I have got to go where the action is [on campus]. And I really like their idea of bridging the gap between Wesleyan and Middletown.” College Greens plan to continue bringing speakers to campus and Middletown. According to Levin, they hope to eventually bring the Green Party’s 2000 Presidential Candidate Ralph Nader. They will also continue to work on the ballot access drive, and, according to Goldman, possibly sponsor a screening of “An Unreasonable Man,” a documentary about Ralph Nader."

		"title": "Civic Engagement Fellowship Will Launch In July",
		"date": "2012-04-09",
		"authors": "by Lily Baggott, Staff Writer",
		"content": "The Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) has launched a new Civic Engagement Fellowship that will begin in July 2012. The fellowship will be a one-year, paid position for a recent graduate. “Civic engagement and engagement with the world is a priority for the University,” Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Catherine Lechowicz said. “We are very excited to have a recent alum fill this role to help connect all of these different things that are happening on campus.” In an effort to connect all of the civic engagement efforts on campus, the new fellowship will have a broad range of responsibilities, according to Lechowicz. Based at the CCP, the fellow will work with the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism (OCS), Green Street Arts Center, Center for Prison Education (CPE), Service-Learning Center, Allbritton Center for Study of Public Life, and the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. “We want these things to be connected and have synergy,” Lechowicz said. “And so this individual will help both in terms of engaging the students that are going through our office and also building bridges to these other areas. [The fellow will] help students see that, while we have different centers, all of this work is definitely connected.” The fellow will connect local civic action by the CCP and academic study, according to Lechowicz. Additionally, the fellow will work with students, manage social media, and generate online resources, among other duties. “What we imagine is that the CCP is really hands on local work, but really the social entrepreneurship piece is providing training and development of ideas in terms of social ventures,” Lechowicz said. “And then the Allbritton Center is more on the academic side in terms of studying public life and looking at it through an academic lens.” Lechowicz noted that she and other staff members were inspired to create the fellowship after seeing the CPE and writing fellowships in action. “It’s similar to the writing fellowships,” Lechowicz said. “I think the great work that has happened with that program through the engagement of recent alums is a really exciting opportunity.” Lechowicz said she envisioned the position for a recent graduate with the University experience sztill fresh on his or her mind. “We’ve all been talking for a while about the amount of work we’re doing through the CCP with limited staffing and seeing that our students are so engaged when they’re here as undergrads,” Lechowicz said. “And we really see this additional year as an opportunity to capture that energy and excitement while also helping the student gain this professional experience in a context that they know really well.” In addition, the fellow will work closely with the new Civic Engagement Certificate Program. “We just started the Civic Engagement Certificate Program,” Lechowicz said. “This person will help in the launching of that program. So there’s lots of different little things that are happening that I think will be really great to have someone helping us focus on that.” With the advent of the Patricelli Center and the growth of the CCP, Lechowicz and other center directors discussed creating this fellowship during the last few months. “These were ongoing conversations between directors here at the Center for Community Partnerships as these other programs were developed,” Lechowicz said. “This is what we see as a need and as an opportunity for students to have a lot of input, as a recent grad, to develop these programs more.” The hiring committee will consist of Lechowicz, Director of Community Relations Frank Kuan, Director of Service Learning Center Suzanne O’Connell, and Internship and Civic Engagement Coordinator Paul Gagnon. The committee accepted applications through April 10, and Lechowicz expressed excitement over the quality of the applicants. The decision will be made by the end of this month in order to have the fellow in office by July. The fellowship will run for one year, from July to June, and will be a full-time, paid fellowship. According to Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Rob Rosenthal, the Executive Budget Committee—composed of himself, President Michael Roth, and Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts-—accepted the fellowship proposal and allocated an estimated $28,000 for the position’s salary. Rosenthal said that the proposal will be reviewed again after two years. “It’s a new money proposal, meaning it’s funded from the general budget but is a pilot program only, which will be reviewed after two years,” Rosenthal wrote in an email to The Argus. Lechowicz said that hiring one fellow would be sufficient to meet the growing demands of the centers. “I think we’ll see how this goes,” she said. “Certainly, through the Office of Community Service, we have grown our programs, but I think it can be managed pretty easily with an additional person.”"

		"title": "Patricelli Center Puts Social Change in Career Path",
		"date": "2012-10-22",
		"authors": "by Rebecca Seidel, Assistant Features Editor",
		"content": "On a campus bustling with activists, it’s easy to tap into the spirit of philanthropy and enthusiasm for social change. For those looking to channel this passion into a nonprofit business venture, or those trying to join the ranks of student leaders who are already doing so, the first place to go is the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. The Patricelli Center is housed in the basement of the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life. Founded last spring through a gift from the Robert [Patricelli ’61] and Margaret Patricelli Family Foundation, the Center provides resources and networking opportunities to students and alumni interested in starting nonprofit enterprises. Now in its second semester, the Patricelli Center is already a campus presence, offering workshops, grants, counseling, and internship opportunities to aspiring social entrepreneurs. The Center also offers extensive networking opportunities, drawing from connections to alumni involved in civic engagement. Its Board of Advisors includes alumni involved in prominent social enterprises, in addition to several members of Wesleyan’s faculty. According to the Center’s Civic Engagement Coordinator and Career Counselor Paul Gagnon, part of the value of having a center devoted to the pursuit of social entrepreneurship is that it offers students a chance to develop business skills not typically taught in classes. “We’re providing opportunities for students to develop skills of what I call a practical benefit, in areas that they might not necessarily get exposure to in their traditional Wesleyan classroom setting,” Gagnon said. To facilitate this type of training, the Patricelli Center holds workshops and seminars at regular intervals that are open to all students. The workshop scheduled for this Thursday, Oct. 25, called “Entrepreneurship Self-Assessment,” will help attendees gauge whether they have what it takes to start up their own business. The Center has also worked closely with a number of nonprofit groups on campus, including Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO), the MINDS Foundation, and Brighter Dawns. “Many of [these groups] actually predate the establishment of the Center, but the Center has helped [to] provide resources to those groups over the course of our first semester here and going forward,” Gagnon said. President and CEO of SHOFCO Kennedy Odede ’12 said he was grateful for the Patricelli Center and the work it does to help organizations such as his. “We will reach over 35,000 people in the Kibera slum this year through healthcare, clean water, community empowerment, and economic development programs,” Odede wrote in an email to The Argus. “This simply wouldn’t have been possible if the Patricelli family did not believe in the bold vision that change is possible even in places like Kibera, where the problems sometime seem insurmountable.” Raghu Appasani ’12, founder and CEO of the MINDS Foundation, noted that the Patricelli Center has offered him helpful business planning advice and connections with alumni since its establishment. “The Patricelli Center has been really helpful with networking,” he said. Connections with alumni are vital to the Patricelli Center’s endeavors. Since its founding, the Center has hosted several alumni guest speakers. The first speaker was Sasha Chanoff ’94, executive director of RefugePoint, a nonprofit offering assistance to refugees in Africa. Lara Galinsky ’96 ran a workshop hosted by the Patricelli Center last year centered on finding studnets’ passion. “It was a workshop-oriented process where students tried to do a self-assessment and identify with what Lara calls ‘heart, head, hustle,’” Gagnon recalled. “The three of those combined to help a student identify what it is that they think they might want to do with their career and their life. Outside of the Career Center, I’m not sure that there’s any other place on campus where a student would’ve been able to have that kind of exposure to that kind of program.” The Center also offers summer internships to Wesleyan students. Applicants put together proposals to work for specific social enterprise organizations or to start their own projects, and their applications are then reviewed by the Center. Additionally, the Patricelli Center offers grants for various student endeavors. It has a seed grant fund for student leaders seeking capital to start new social enterprises, and it also offers grants on a competitive basis for students to participate in off-campus social entrepreneurship training programs. Gagnon said that he hopes students will talk to him if they have ideas for organizations or projects they want to start. He outlined the steps he would take in guiding a student through hir ideas. “We’d be able to discuss it, and we’d be able to talk through some of the pertinent points that you’re trying to achieve,” he said. “I’d ask you to convince me why you want to pursue this. Convince me of your passion, and convince me of the underlying application to the nature of the problem you’re trying to address in the first place. Then I’d encourage you to make use of the workshops.” Gagnon added that the Center would work to connect a student with alumni, potentially find a mentor to help determine a direction for the project, and offer assistance with business mechanics like marketing and accounting. Above all, Gagnon said he wants the Patricelli Center to be a “home away from home” for aspiring social entrepreneurs. “Last spring, I’d say that this room acted as a clubhouse for a number of students because they were working on their company projects here, and that’s precisely the kind of environment that we want to foster and facilitate here,” he said. Co-president of Wesleyan’s chapter of the MINDS Foundation Ian Johnson ’13 expressed his appreciation for the Center’s resources. “We use the office space in there for all of our small meetings,” Johnson said. “Having the Patricelli Center also provides support and confidence for student entrepreneurship and collaboration.” Appasani agreed. “The office space in the Patricelli Center has been crucial for working late nights,” he said. Gagnon said that the number of non-profit campus groups is a testament to student dedication to social change. “It’s remarkable, the capability these students possess and their determination to get something done,” Gagnon said. “They’re so committed to making things happen—making a difference.” In a WesSeminar presentation on Oct. 18th, Gagnon cited data indicating that students these days are more interested than ever in careers involving civic engagement. A report done by Net Impact showed that 58 percent of students nationwide are willing to take a pay cut to work for an organization with values similar to their own. The same report found that a majority of students are confident that their work will eventually make a positive difference in the world. “When this generation cannot find a socially conscious job uniquely right for them, they create one,” Gagnon said. Additionally, Gagnon noted that in 2004 only about 20 colleges in the United States had a course or program focused on social entrepreneurship. Now, that figure is estimated to exceed 200. In some schools, social entrepreneurship comprises an entire department. Though there are many factors contributing to this attitude among young people, Gagnon said that it largely has to do with more students trying to link their passions to their career paths. “I think more and more young people are recognizing that there’s this need to do something that is larger than oneself,” he said. “I think that the students are seeing more than just being an individual or a cog in the wheel, and they’re trying to find something that more inspires their passions.” Gagnon said that beyond this generation’s inclinations toward social enterprise, Wesleyan in particular tends to generate lots of social entrepreneurs. “It seems like it’s just natural for Wesleyan to support this kind of activity and this kind of endeavor from a student’s perspective,” he said."

		"title": "I’ll Donate When Wesleyan Earns My Donation",
		"date": "2012-10-26",
		"authors": "by Nicholas Quah, Class of 2013",
		"content": "All right, I’m going to throw my hat into this ring. The University is cash-starved. Thus, the Wesleyan administration’s primary concern at this point in time is to try to find ways to maintain and develop a financial base that will allow it to do its job, which is to provide a liberal arts education according to a certain set of values. In other words, it has to find ways to survive in order to keep doing what it’s doing. In this pursuit, the University possesses two broad strategic directions which can and should be pursued simultaneously: (1) to increase cash inflow, and (2) to cut as much spending as possible in areas that it can practically bear. The University has thus far pushed a number of initiatives on both fronts. However, many of these initiatives are controversial. The University has chosen to make certain morally questionable investments to increase the cash inflow (catalyzing the emergence of the Committee for Investor Responsibility), and now has made a push to cut need-blind admissions (which has sprung up this entire conversation). As we have come to be quite familiar with, the core conflict here is the following: should the university compromise some of the fundamental values it purports to hold in the pursuit of mere institutional survival? Or, to put it another way: is it better to survive by compromising your principles, or is it better to struggle to commit to your original values, but risk a very possible end to your institutional existence? Indeed, in my mind, these questions lie at the periphery of a much deeper and infinitely more vital question: What the hell is the point of Wesleyan? There was a time in our history when Wesleyan was affiliated with fiercely liberal social values. These values included (but certainly were not limited to) a commitment to educational accessibility, to societal diversity, to free speech, to the unburdened pursuit of art and knowledge, to academic excellence, and to the holistic cultivation of its students. Furthermore, there was also a commitment to a higher value that transcended mere materiality. There was a sense that it is imperative that those who walk the halls of Olin should not only be people who could afford it, but for everybody who deserved a chance at a good education and subsequently a good life. A university has core practical responsibilities as well. A university is responsible for allowing its students to stand a chance of achieving gainful employment, for the securing the safety of its campus environment, and for being there when students need help in any and all forms. I submit that this constellation of values and responsibilities should be the point of Wesleyan. Of course, you are perfectly free to hold and voice your own views. You are perfectly free to believe that Wesleyan matters more as a physical institution, and that it should remain so no matter how far it may drift from the values and responsibilities it purports to hold. If this is the case, then I suggest you stop reading—in case you haven’t already. Now, I have been following these developments from afar quite closely, and a few things have come to my mind. Firstly, it seems odd to me that the administration is making the argument that the option to cut need-blind is absolutely imperative. That, under all these financial burdens, this is an absolutely necessary way to open enough financial breathing space. Is this truly the case? I cannot say anything about this for myself, for I am not privy to the accounting at hand. Secondly, surely it is the case that spending cuts can be made elsewhere in far less vital places. Surely we do not need all the amenities we seem to be getting. Are flat-screen TVs in residence halls and classrooms the most cost-effective and productive ways of enhancing Wesleyan’s educational experience? Do we really need flashy new construction projects for any reason other than safety? Will expanding the student body really cover the cash inflow problem, or will it exacerbate it instead? And finally, why in the world is President Roth doing an excruciatingly horrendous job at community engagement and communication? Aren’t we in the same boat, after all? But let me get to the point of why I started writing this entire piece in the first place. I fully defend the alums’ move to cease their donations. My reasoning is simple: while I understand that our donations may be vital to the supply of the University’s cash inflow, it can also be perceived as a tacit form of approval for the policies that the university is planning to enact in its pursuit to stay afloat. In other words, if I give you my money, you might—and probably will—take that as an indication that I approve of the decisions you are making. And it just so happens that I absolutely disagree with the direction that this university is moving towards. Some have made the argument that stopping our donations isn’t going to help – in fact, it’s making the situation worse. Indeed, I understand the anxiety and concerns from which this argument emerges, and I do hesitate in lending my support to this issue when I remember that this argument does come from students who depend on financial aid which in turn depends on our donations. But you know what? The school’s probably going to cut you anyway. And they might think I – along with other like-minded alum peers – are completely cool with it, and that they will not really be held accountable for it. Yes, I have a commitment to my alma mater. But my commitment is not blind. It is not uncritical. To rephrase it in more accurate terms: I have a commitment to the ideals my alma mater once shared with me. Right now, at this point in time, with Wesleyan’s failure to address sexual assaults, to properly build a sense of community and solidarity in a healthy fashion, and to make good and moral decisions to stay afloat, I cannot support you. I will not support you. And I will certainly not let you lie or talk down to me. Now, I graduated this past spring. And let me tell you, the emails asking for donations came very, very quickly. I graduated in the immediate aftermath of the Holi incident, where the University failed to take a normative stance on the matter, and right before all this crap kicked in. I graduated at a ceremony where the president gave what was ultimately a tepid speech – a speech full of clichés and tropes and empty pieces of inspirational sound-bites. A speech that was in essence all flash and very little substance. A speech that perhaps represents a forecast of what Wesleyan is to become. I love this place. To the very fiber of my being, I do. There has not been a day when I have not thought about how it felt to be a member of the family there. Foss, Olin, the particular smell of Butterfield A, raging silently in a crowd of ecstatic young people, late nights in PAC – these are all things that I will take with me wherever I go.  And so, it is with a heavy heart that I implore you, whoever you are, to remember why you are part of this community, and what you want from this community. Keep talking. Don’t shut down the conversation. You deserve a real conversation. The great comic Louis CK once said (to Jon Stewart, no less) that “all conversation is good conversation.” I’ve been reading the comments section on Wesleying, and you know what? I think they’re great, even the abundance of cynical ones. Like that one Wes grad who wrote, passionately, “Bottom line, Wesleyan kids need to realize that stomping your feet does not get you what you want like it did when you were a kid. The world is not fair sometimes.” Or that other one from another Wes grad, who wrote: “I donated two days ago. And I don’t regret my decision.” They are points of view, they are perspectives, and I think it’s completely cool that you folks hold them. But they are not arguments, and they are words that end real conversations. Please, speak more. Tell us why you don’t regret your decision. Tell us why you think the world isn’t fair sometimes, and why we should accept that. If there’s one academic thing I ever learned from my time at Wesleyan (via Professor Richard Adelstein), it’s that we’re always working with imperfect information. Heck, while I was writing this, I just found out from another alum that spending on flat-screen TVs is miniscule compared to the rest of the budget. Because we’re working with individual limitations, we need to work together. We need to collaborate, we need to keep working through this together, and most of all, we need to respect one another. Once again, I implore you: remember why you are part of this community, and what you want this community to be. I will not lie to you – there is a chance that you will fail. There is a chance that at the end of the day, you will have to either give up on our ideals or fold as an institution (unrealistic as that might be). But if you do fail, it will not be for a lack of trying. It will not be because you never gave yourselves a chance. Whatever, I’m still pretty optimistic. You can find a way. You just need to keep looking, and to do that, you have to keep talking. Good luck. I know you can do it.   xoxo Nicholas Quah ’12/frostedmoose. PS: I usually like being anonymous. I like not getting phone calls, not being reduced as a person to a single argument, and I like being able to change my mind on things (but not on a Romney-level). But I think this is something I should stand up on. Other alums, if you’re reading this, please stand up too. I t’s not like they can write us up, AMIRIGHT??   tl;dr – (1) Please keep talking, and (2) I’ll donate when Wesleyan earns my donation. Until then, Ira Glass and NPR will get my cash money."

		"title": "Student Political Groups Battle Voting Apathy",
		"date": "2012-11-01",
		"authors": "by Alexandra Ozols, Staff Writer",
		"content": "As the Nov. 6 Election Day approaches, campus political groups have been working to ignite a democratic spark in the student body. Given the University’s reputation as an activist campus, some of the students who are working the hardest for student political engagement expressed their disappointment with the level of student interest during an election cycle that includes a close presidential contest as well as close senatorial races. “There’s a sense that reading the news and watching the debates constitute political engagement,” Wesleyan Democrats (WesDems) president Michael Linden ’15 said. “But there’s more to do.” Linden said that he perceives a sense of apathy on the part of college students in general and in University students in particular. “Disillusionment of college students [with the political process] stems from a general sense that their vote doesn’t matter,” he said. “Even though their vote is probably not going to be the deciding vote, exercising it is still a meaningful act of civic engagement.” In response to the perceived apathy, the WesDems have spent most of the last six weeks conducting a series of “dorm storms,” mostly in freshman housing. Linden said those efforts netted between 100 and 200 new student voter registrations in Middletown. Linden said his organization focused its voter registration drive on Connecticut residents and out-of-state students who had never registered in their home states. “Student-to-student outreach is very effective,” he said. Linden noted that such outreach could be critical in Connecticut, where there is a competitive Senate race between Democratic Representative of the 5th Congressional District Chris Murphy and the Republican candidate former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, who ran against Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 election. “I understand being disillusioned with Obama, but what the gridlock in Washington has taught us is that down ballot races have a real impact,” Linden said. “While I think a lot of students say, ‘The two-party system isn’t for me,’ it’s a reality, and there’s a very clear dichotomy between the two parties.” Wesleyan for Warren campus organizer Sam Ebb ’13 agrees. His group has rallied students in support of Democrat Elizabeth Warren, who is challenging Republican incumbent Scott Brown in the Massachusetts senatorial contest. Ebb said he believes Warren’s positions resonate with the progressive University student body. He cited the Harvard professor’s economic policies and her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for the Obama administration. “Also, Brown’s co-sponsorship of the Blunt Amendment and vote against equal pay for equal work should be big sticking points for members of the Wesleyan community,” Ebb said. During this semester, the 15-20 students actively involved in the Wesleyan for Warren organization—including its six interns, some of whom had worked for the campaign during the summer—conducted an absentee ballot drive and ran weekly phone banks to connect with undecided and independent voters in Massachusetts. Several of the core members also spent a few weekends canvassing in Worcester, Mass., for their candidate. According to Ebb, the organization also supported WesDems’ efforts on behalf of Connecticut candidate Murphy. “Most people at Wesleyan are going to support Obama and Murphy,” Linden said. “It’s just a matter of whether they’re going to get out and vote.” Democracy Matters, a non-partisan national student organization, emphasizes college student participation in elections. President of the University’s chapter of Democracy Matters Alyssa Bonneau ’14 expressed support for the need to encourage even politically astute students to exercise the franchise. “You come to Wesleyan and have expectations for an activist campus, but we’re not as politically active as people think we are,” Bonneau said. “Compared to other places, people do intend to vote.” Bonneau said that, while her group is very small, it has been working with the WesDems to urge students to make a plan to vote. “The most important thing is to create an atmosphere of excitement and to try to remind people that this is an historic event,” she said. As part of its get-out-the-vote effort, Democracy Matters has arranged for free coffee for any student who brings in a mug to the Red and Black Café and presents hir voting sticker. The recently founded Students for a Free Society has chosen not to endorse any political candidate, nor has it engaged in any election campaigning. “Students for a Free Society has attracted people who, for the most part, reject the liberal-conservative dichotomy,” said the group’s founder and president Charlie Smith ’15. According to Smith, the new group is composed of libertarians, anarchists, conservatives, communists, and left-wingers. “Many people feel disillusioned with the two main parties and generally tend to be skeptical of government,” Smith said. “Some people in the group may not vote because they don’t want to have to pick the lesser of two evils. We would rather try to educate people and change their views than ask them to make a vote that isn’t necessarily an educated one.” Monica Sheridan ’15, a former member of Wesleyan Republicans, said she is not interested in resurrecting the group, which is now listed as inactive on the Wesleyan Student Assembly webpage. She described most campus Republicans as fiscal conservatives with generally libertarian views on social issues who can be integrated into the new Students for a Free Society. In contrast to 2011, when University students voted at five different polling sites, this year students registered at their campus address will vote at one of two polling stations. Because of redistricting, the vast majority will vote at the senior center located across from Broad Street Books, and those living north of Washington Street will vote at the Macdonough Elementary School. Shuttles will ferry students from Usdan to the two polling sites every 10 minutes on Election Day, Nov. 6."

		"title": "University Will Not Relocate Bookstore",
		"date": "2012-12-06",
		"authors": "by Daniel Greenberg, News Editor",
		"content": "In response to firm opposition by members of the Middletown and Wesleyan communities, the University has decided not to relocate its bookstore to the Washington Street site proposed by the Middletown real estate company Centerplan Companies. President Michael Roth announced this decision at the faculty meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 4. The next day, Associate Vice President for Finance Nathan Peters and Associate Vice President for Facilities Joyce Topshe sent out an all-campus email to announce the decision and the reasoning behind it. “On the basis of strong community sentiment, Wesleyan has decided not to relocate its bookstore to Washington Street,” wrote Peters and Topshe. “Objections to the bookstore relocation (and planned development) included concerns about pedestrian safety, increased traffic, and disruption of the residential neighborhood.” Centerplan’s proposal to include the University bookstore in a three-story complex had been met with considerable criticism. Some of the more common critiques included the dangers of crossing the very busy Washington Street and concern about the negative effects of introducing national chains into Middletown. The University’s decision pleased those who opposed the relocation, including Red and Black Café Owner Ed Thorndike ’89, whose café might have been closed if the bookstore had moved. “Obviously we are pleased with the decision and not too surprised,” wrote Thorndike in an email to The Argus. “We hope Centerplan withdraws their plan for a scaled down development. As so many people in the Wes community have argued, it’s a terrible location for such a development.” Many other students and faculty approved of the University’s decision not to go forward with the relocation proposal. “I’ve been opposed to the project for a while now,” said Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) Finance and Facilities Committee Chair Andrew Trexler ’14. “The Middletown community and the Wesleyan community have generally been in opposition to it, and it would be damaging to town-gown relations if Wesleyan went ahead with the project without the Middletown community’s support.” At the forum, Centerplan CEO Robert Landino said that even if the University decided not to move the bookstore, the development on Washington Street might still go into construction. “We probably would go forward with a two-floor building, not a three-floor building, that would include a first floor of retail and a second floor of our offices,” said Landino. Despite the University’s decision, Wesleyan remains under contract with Centerplan to sell one of the Washington Street properties that will comprise the new site. “Wesleyan is still under contract to sell one of the four properties to [Centerplan],” Trexler said. “It’s a piece of property that [the University has] been trying to sell for some time. We didn’t offer them anything, it’s just been on the market, and they have a contract to buy it. We could try to pull out of the contract, but there are certain legal implications for that, but there has been some talk about [doing that] among Wesleyan and the Middletown community.” Though the idea of relocating the bookstore to Washington Street faced heavy criticism, several people have advocated different improvements to the bookstore. “We do think this is a good opportunity for the University to re-examine the bookstore,” wrote Thorndike. “The business of selling books is rapidly changing, and we should bring all the stakeholders (students, faculty, administration, local community, Follett, and Red & Black Café) together to discuss where the store is headed and what, if any, changes should be made.”"

		"title": "CCP Launches Campaign to Highlight Town-Gown Collaborations",
		"date": "2013-02-04",
		"authors": "by Michelle Li, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "Even within the University bubble, students are often unaware of the institutional practices around them; buildings get constructed, lightbulbs get changed, toilets get plunged, and nobody really knows how. Beginning Tuesday, Feb. 5, the Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) will launch a new campaign  titled, “Did You Know?” which is aimed at raising awareness of the partnerships connecting the University and Middletown. Some students feel that they could benefit from learning more about the University’s relations with Middletown. “I think Wesleyan students would participate in more civic engagement if they knew more about what’s going on,” Jessica Seidman ’16 said. “Wesleyan feels kind of like a separate community from Middletown.” Heading the campaign are Civic Engagement Fellow for the Center for Community Partnerships Dana Pellegrino ’12 and Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Cathy Lechowicz. Pellegrino explained that the campaign will feature twice-weekly sound bites giving facts on relations between Middletown and the University. The Service-Learning Center, the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism, and the Office of Community Relations are three branches of the CCP, the umbrella group of offices that works on University-community initiatives. In addition, several student groups, such as Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO), Wesleyan Alliance for Generational Exchange (WesAGE), Woodrow Wilson Tutoring, and Housing and Hunger, as well as service-learning classes, are also part of the Center. The resources of the CCP are available to students interested in civic engagement. According to Pellegrino, the pieces of information that “Did You Know?” publishes will come from University offices and student groups. The project will rely strongly on student feedback. The Office of Community Service (OCS), in addition to offering students the opportunity to secure work-study positions, allows some student groups the chance to help out in projects such as the “Did You Know?” campaign. Lechowicz said that students will have the opportunity to contribute to posts of the “Did You Know?” Campaign. The sound bites will be posted Tuesdays and Thursdays on various social media outlets, among which are Twitter @wes_engage, the OCS Facebook page, the webpage of the CCP, and the Middletown Eye, a blog managed by Middletown residents. Despite the many media outlets the campaign will be utilizing, not all students are optimistic that the project will meet its intended goals. Although Seidman indicated interest in learning more about partnerships between Middletown and the University, Maria Massad ’16 expressed some doubts about the campaign. “I think increasing Middletown-University relations is a noble cause, but I think people should be integrated into the community through events and not blogs,” Massad said. Both Pellegrino and Lechowicz emphasized that the campaign’s main focus is on raising awareness of town-gown partnerships. “This is not sugarcoat[ing] about engagement,” Lechowicz said. Pellegrino additionally notes that that the campaign is not intended to make students feel that the University is improving Middletown; rather, the sound bites will showcase occasions of equal partnership between the University and the town. “It’s about sharing the little things that go on that people may not know about,” Lechowicz said."

		"title": "University Announces $400 Million “This is Why” Campaign",
		"date": "2013-02-18",
		"authors": "by Lily Baggott, Christina Norris, News Editors",
		"content": "The University is kicking off the public phase of its latest fundraising campaign, the first phase of which began during the 2008 fiscal year. During the first phase, called a “quiet” or “nucleus” phase, administrators solicited donations from members of the University community and received over $270 million. The goal for the entire campaign, scheduled to last approximately eight years, is to raise $400 million. Over half of the money raised will go into the University’s endowment. The campaign’s theme, “This is Why,” is meant to encourage donors to think about why one might donate to the University. “Instead of us telling students, alumni, and parents why they should support the University, they should tell us why they care about Wesleyan,” said President Michael Roth. “They might say, ‘I don’t like what the administration’s doing, but this is why I love Wesleyan,’ or maybe, ‘Because I’m on the volleyball team, this is why I love Wesleyan.’ Someone else might say, ‘This is…because of the lab work I did,’ and someone else will say, ‘It’s because I met my spouse there.’ We don’t need to homogenize it into a single stream.” Manager of Media Relations and Public Relations Katherine Carlisle explained that while the bulk of the money raised will be put toward financial aid, many aspects of University operations will benefit from the donations. “It will help support recruiting faculty who are the best and the most talented, which is what we want to have working here,” Carlisle said. “[It will] also help support a lot of the programs that are very important to Wesleyan: the interdisciplinary programs, research funding, stipends for internships, and other types of student engagement which Wesleyan is known for.” Carlisle and Roth explained that when planning the campaign, administrators decided against some more standard approaches to fundraising. “When we started talking about this as a campaign, the issue that arose pretty quickly was that campaigns are marches, parades of people singing the same songs, wearing the same clothes,” Roth said. “This kind of doesn’t really work at Wesleyan. When we talked to our consultants about how to do this public phase…[they really thought] that Wesleyan would be better served by a campaign made by the constituents of the University rather than made by the administration or by a consultant.” In a search for a new style of fundraising, Roth explained, campaign planners decided on the “This is Why” theme in order to elicit vocal support from donors. “The support has been really encouraging,” Roth said. “There are people who are upset about need-blind. There are other people who are upset the football team hasn’t won enough games. There are lots of reasons not to give, but so many people are, in fact, supporting the University.” Roth said that the University has decided against having an expensive launch party or sending “glossy” pamphlets to potential donors. “It’s a little bit of an un-campaign,” Carlisle said. “It’s not traditionally the way a lot of our peer institutions have a somewhat more traditional approach to fundraising. This one has a lot more Wesleyan feel and appeal to it.” When donors give to the University, money goes either into the endowment, a long-term savings and investment vehicle, or the Wesleyan Fund, an annual fund used for more immediate needs. According to Editor and New Media Writer Lauren Rubenstein, this year’s goal for the Wesleyan Fund is $10.25 million. Of the money raised in this campaign, about $200 million, half of the $400 million fundraising goal, will be committed to financial aid, which will come either from the University’s endowment or the Wesleyan Fund. Another $140 million raised will come from endowment donations and be used to enlist faculty and foster distinct University programs. The remaining $60 million will be devoted to community engagement, internships, and research. According to Vice President for University Relations Barbara-Jan Wilson, during the last fundraising campaign, which closed in December of 2004, the University raised $281 million. “We are right on target for the current campaign and will go public having already raised very close to the total amount of our last campaign,” Wilson wrote in an email to The Argus. “That is great news!” Wilson explained that during this campaign, certain groups will be approached more than they were in past years. “We are trying our best to engage younger alumni (GOLD: Graduates of the Last Decade) and parents, as well as our traditional, core donors from the last campaign,” Wilson wrote. Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts explained that the University has various revenue streams, the largest of which are tuition, the endowment draw, and the annual Wesleyan Fund. Meerts said that these streams are incorporated into a long-range financial projection for the University. According to Meerts, many donations are designated for specific uses and projects, and although they increase the overall budget, they do not necessarily relieve existing strains on the budget. “So not necessarily all of the money that comes in is going to be unrestricted and therefore … budget-relieving, so it [only] makes it possible to do other things that we otherwise wouldn’t be able to do,” Meerts said. “And of course I like the campaign, of course I like the $400 million, quite a bit of which we have already received, but I just want to make sure that it’s understood that the net of this is that we will pretty much continue to do what we are doing right now.” However, some restricted donations do help alleviate current strains on the budget, such as donations for new constructions or renovations that the University was previously planning. The donation would then free up money previously set aside for the construction or renovation and thus allow that money to be used for other purposes at the discretion of the University. Still, Meerts noted that unrestricted money would be the most beneficial for the University’s budgetary planning. “So the best thing that could happen is tons of unrestricted money. People say to Wesleyan, ‘Here, we love you, Wesleyan. Here’s money, you decide what to do with it,’” he said. “It doesn’t always work that way.” Nevertheless, Roth expressed optimism about the campaign. “We’ve been very encouraged by the gifts we’ve received,” he said. “I shouldn’t jinx it, but the end of this year should be the best two years we’ve ever had of fundraising, even in a terrible economy.”"

		"title": "Students Assemble for Social Justice Leadership Conference",
		"date": "2013-02-28",
		"authors": "by Lindsay Dittman, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "Josephine Ho/Staff Photographer On Saturday, Feb. 23, the fifth annual Social Justice Leadership Conference took place at 41 Wyllys Ave. First organized by Associate Director of Student Activities and Leadership Development Elisa Cardona and the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) in 2008, the conference is a community-based initiative that brings students, staff, faculty, and Middletown residents together to lead sessions on social justice and improve their leadership skills. Event coordination was based out of the Office of Student Activities and Leadership Development (SALD). The planning committee was comprised of students and Dean Marina Melendez. “We chose the theme ‘Building Bridges: Connecting Communities Across Difference’ because most people agreed that the idea of allyship was something that we should focus on,” said SALD Leadership Intern Winston Soh ’14. The sessions focused on leadership skills that could be applied to any social movement. One hundred individuals, mostly students, registered for the conference. “I think if there’s a way to get even more students, faculty, and staff to attend, that would be great,” said participant Catherine MacLean ’14. “This is such a unique opportunity that Wesleyan and SALD provide, and it would be great to see more people participate.” The conference began with an 11 a.m. brunch, during which keynote speaker and former Medical Director of the Davison Health Center P. Davis Smith spoke about the role he played in establishing a sexual health clinic that was non-discriminatory to gender identity. After leaving the University, Smith went on to start a practice that focused on serving transgendered patients. “We thought that as someone that people personally knew and could relate to, [Smith] was great for the conference,” Soh said. Syed Ali ’13, a participant at the conference, commented on Smith’s speech. “The keynote speaker, P. Davis Smith, had a powerful message,” Ali said. “The application of allyship in his career was intriguing and inspirational. Smith’s message resonated in terms of quotidian life, practical steps, and social entrepreneurship.” The rest of the day consisted of three 50-minute block sessions, during which a different presenter spoke at each session. A variety of student group members spoke during session blocks one and two. These included Dwight Greene Intern for Community Engagement and Discussion Christian Hosam ’15, Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) Intern Rachel Verner ’15, Queer Resource Center (QRC) Intern Kathryn Thompson ’15, Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitators (WesDEF), President of Economie Dance Kehan Zhou ’15, and a representative from Wesleyan Students for Disability Rights. Topics ranged from how to construct racial bridges through literature to Zhou’s presentation on how to use dance to fight for social justice. The third block included a performance by Rebecca Wyzan ’15 from MIX and two talks by Office of Residential Life Area Coordinator Daniel LaBonte and Director of Religious and Spiritual Life and University Jewish Chaplain Rabbi David Leipziger-Teva. The conference also included a “Reflection and Wrap-Up” session toward the end of the day. “My favorite event was the closing session,” Ali said. “For the very last activity, we all stood in a circle and threw around a colorful ball of yarn. Every person named an action they would take in light of the conference. It was reassuring to see that not only had the conference been a learning experience for so many, but that it could potentially result in tangible changes. At the end, we had a beautiful web of yarn connecting all of us—a physical representation of our community.”"

		"title": "Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity at Met Revitalizes an Old Age",
		"date": "2013-03-28",
		"authors": "by Yi Ding, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "“The latest fashion…is absolutely necessary for a painting. It’s what matters most,” read  a quotation by Edouard Manet displayed at the entrance of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, on view from Feb. 26 to May 27. The Paris-centric exhibition reveals how painters from the mid-1860s to the mid-1880s “embrace la mode (fashion) as the harbinger of la modernité (modernity),” as the website description for the exhibit explains. Featuring the most important art works of Impressionism and its contemporaries, such as Monet’s “Luncheon on the Grass,” the exhibition is a must-see for those who crave the opportunity to see precious 19th-century modernist artworks selected from museums such as Musée d’Orsay, The Art Institute of Chicago, and the National Portrait Gallery in London. By presenting more than 80 paintings accompanied by period apparel—such as a gray and green striped silk day dress that sets the stage for Monet’s captivating “Camille,” delicate 19th-century fans, fashion plates, photographs, and popular prints—the exhibition transmits the charming ambiance of late-19th-century Paris to viewers in a very intimate way. Looking at the paintings with an eye toward fashion, viewers get a glimpse of Parisian society. For example, one dress bears close resemblance to that depicted in Renoir’s “Madame Georges Charpentier et ses Enfants,” painted in 1878. Along with the Japanese-style drawing room of the family’s Parisian townhouse in the painting, the black silk gown is a testament to Madame Charpentier’s stylish taste. As a nostalgic Owen Wilson in “Midnight in Paris” understands some paintings by mysteriously traveling back to the 1920s every midnight, viewers of this exhibition also get a great opportunity to understand modernity, the core concept dealt with by impressionists and their contemporaries, by looking at famous paintings through the lens of fashion. By reimagining figure painting, exploring the effects of light and shade on newly aniline-dyed fabrics, and focusing on accessories such as single jet earrings, artists of that time aligned with Baudelaire’s definition of modernity as “the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent” through different treatment of fashion. In addition to considering Manet’s treatment of the female figure in his paintings in a sexual, and thus controversial way, viewers may be inspired to reconsider his works, such as the famous “Lady with Fan (Portrait of Nina de Callias),” from a fashion perspective. With her golden bangles, bolero jacket, and Algerian shirt, Nina was a dramatic contrast to most female figures in other paintings in this exhibition, including Madame Charpentier in Renoir’s portrait. The exhibition ended with the topic of Spaces of Modern Life. Indeed, public spaces such as grand ballrooms, gilded theater boxes, and open gatherings offered “new vistas and venues to see and to be seen,” according to the exhibition description. And fashion is the epitome of such a visual culture. The unique perspective of the exhibition, which the catalog claims is the “first to explore fashion as a critical aspect of modernity,” provides a fresh look into Parisian life and modernity as a whole."

		"title": "Chalk is Talk: Is Wesleyan’s Chalking Ban Illegal?",
		"date": "2013-03-29",
		"authors": "by Eric Stephen, Assistant Editor-in-Chief, Emeritus",
		"content": "Shannon Welch/Photo Editor Wesleyan University is now just under halfway into the 11th year of a blanket moratorium on chalking on campus property. The moratorium (or perhaps we should just call it a ban since there is nothing to suggest that this is a temporary limitation), announced on Oct. 3, 2002 in a campus-wide email by then-President Douglas Bennet, was justified on the grounds that “halking, as practiced, undermines our sense of community and impedes substantive dialogue.” While both Presidents Bennet (1995-2007) and Michael Roth (2007-) have provided justifications for the ban on chalking, both arguments appear to be predicated on the notion that, because Wesleyan is a private institution, the University has no responsibility to state or federal protections of freedom of speech. As a result, student response to the ban over the course of the last decade has focused on the ethical issues surrounding a suppression of speech and not the legality of the moratorium itself. However, state law suggests that this story is not so simple. It is time, therefore, for the dog to bark—for students to look critically at the prohibition to see whether the University is enforcing an illegal policy and, more broadly, what rights we as students have to speak within our privately owned ivory tower. In this article, it will be argued that Wesleyan’s chalking ban is facially unenforceable because it violates Connecticut state law, specifically Connecticut General Statute §31-51q, which, in brief, protects some employee speech from infringement by an employer. The chalking ban is overbroad in that it prohibits some legally protected speech—for example, that of students who are employed by the University—and therefore is an invalid policy that should no longer be imposed until sufficient considerations are made regarding free speech rights on campus. Federal Constitutional Protections of Free Speech The First Amendment to the United States Constitution affirms that “Congress shall pass no law…abridging the freedom of speech.” Although the Free Speech Clause now applies to state governments under the Fourteenth Amendment, Gitlow v. New York (1925), constitutional protections in general do not ordinarily extend to infringements by private actors. DeShaney v. Winnebago County(1989). This is to say, for example, that an individual does not have the constitutional right to enter the house of another person to preach to her. Private actors, such as people or institutions that are not affiliated with the government, are able to infringe upon the speech of others without constitutional recourse. Thus, the first question to ask when determining the legality of the chalking ban is whether the University is itself a private actor. In Marsh v. Alabama (1946), the Supreme Court found that “the more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.” However, in Rendell-Baker v. Kohn (1982), the Court later refused to consider a privately owned school to be a state actor, even though the school received money from the government and the school served a genuine public function. It appears, then, that there is little argument that could be made that Wesleyan University is not a private actor for the purposes of the First Amendment. However, there are a few caveats in the jurisprudence subsequent to Marsh that require exploration. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins (1980), for example, suggests that, although limitations on speech by private actors may not trigger federal protection, state constitutions may confer expanded speech rights than the federal constitution requires. In this case, the Court determined that the California state constitution codified much broader protections for free speech than the federal constitution, and the more expansive state constitution should be respected in instances such as these. Similarly, Hudgens v. NLRB (1976) explains that state laws “may in some situations extend protection or provide redress against a private corporation or person who seeks to abridge the free expression of others.” Thus, if we do not dispute the claim that Wesleyan is a private actor, it appears from Marsh, Hudgens, and PruneYard that the University may still be limited on the types of speech it can infringe upon by both the Connecticut state constitution and also state law. Shannon Welch/Photo Editor Connecticut State Constitutional Protections on Free Speech Following PruneYard, the state constitution may trigger broader free speech protections than the federal constitution. For the purposes of free speech, the most relevant sections of the Connecticut Constitution would include §4 “Every citizen may freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty” and §14 “The citizens have a right, in a peaceable manner, to assemble for their common good, and to apply those invested with the powers of government, for redress of grievances, or other proper purposes, by petition, address, or remonstrance.” (For religious speech, §3 will also be implicated.) According to the Connecticut Supreme Court, however, the Connecticut Constitution is not expansive enough to protect speech against infringement by private actors. In Cologne v. Westfarms Associates (1984), the state court determined that there was “no evidence [in the Connecticut Constitution] of any intention to vest in those seeking to exercise such rights as free speech and petition the privilege of doing so upon the property of others” (on page 59 suggesting that this even applies to private university property). Thus, unlike California in PruneYard (or New Jersey, Colorado, Oregon, Massachusetts, Washington, and Pennsylvania similarly), the state constitution of Connecticut does not enshrine free speech protections when dealing with private actors. Connecticut Statutory Protections on Free Speech However, as noted in PruneYard, “a state may adopt, in its own constitution, individual liberties more expansive than those conferred by the federal constitution and a statute is, for that purpose, in the same category as a state constitution.”  Thus, it is possible that some refuge can be found in state law for questioning the legality of the chalking ban. Although there is no statute that protects all individuals from having their speech restrained by private actors, there appears to be some limitations that exist specifically to protect the speech of employees. Connecticut General Statute §31-51q holds that “Any employer…who subjects any employee to discipline or discharge on account of the exercise by such employee of rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the United States Constitution or section 3, 4, or 14 of article first of the Constitution of the state, provided such activity does not substantially or materially interfere with the employee’s bona fide job performance or the working relationship between the employee and employer, shall be liable to such employee for damages caused by such discipline or discharge…” Simply put, employees are afforded legal protections against discipline or discharge from their employers for speech if (1) that speech is otherwise constitutionally protected, and (2) that speech does not substantially interfere with job performance or a working relationship. This understanding, albeit somewhat more limited, was affirmed by the Connecticut Supreme Court in Cotto v. United Technologies (1999): “We conclude that §31-51q applies to some activities and speech that occur at the workplace because…there is no prohibition that prevents a legislature from protecting employee speech wherever it occurs.” However, Cotto did provide some further qualifications. According to Cotto, §31-51q parallels federal statute 42 U.S.C. §1983, and thus Supreme Court interpretations of that law should inform state law as well. According to the Supreme Court in Waters v. Churchill  (1994), in order to be protected by Section 1983, “the speech must be on a matter of public concern, and the employee’s interest in expressing himself on this matter must not be outweighed by any injury the speech could cause” to employee relationships. Similarly, in Connick v. Myers (1983), the Court found that “conduct at a governmental employer’s workplace is not constitutionally protected unless the expressive activity concerns a matter of public, social, or other concern to the country.” Finally, although not mentioned in Cotto because it was not at issue in the facts of the case, Section 1983 can also protect religious speech, including religious speech that does not abut national concerns. Rosenberger v. University of Virginia (1995). Following the Court in Cotto, it therefore appears that any employee, including student employees, can invoke §31-51q for employer discipline as a result of their speech if  (1) the speech is otherwise constitutionally protected, (2) the speech does not substantially interfere with job performance or the working relationship, and (3) the speech is either religious or of pressing national concern. To be sure, there exist some forms of speech that can meet all three above requirements. As a result, the University cannot, without second thought to civil liberties, ban any and all speech that it dislikes. In the state of Connecticut, some speech cannot be infringed upon, even by private employers. For chalking to be protected by §31-51q, we must first argue that chalking is constitutionally protected speech. From there, it would likely be most useful to next argue that the moratorium is facially invalid because of overbreadth—it does not allow for speech that withstands prongs two and three above to survive on University campus despite legal protection.

		"title": "University to Host First Diversity Awards Ceremony",
		"date": "2013-04-11",
		"authors": "by Millie Dent, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "On April 28, the University will host the first Edgar Beckham Helping Hands Award Ceremony. The event will celebrate and recognize exemplary students who have exhibited cultural sensitivity and who promote diversity and inclusion. Phabinly Gabriel ’13 and Luciana Pennant ’13 initiated the award ceremony on campus. Gabriel explained the award is named after the University’s first African American dean. “[Beckham] was an advocate for diversity in education and academic excellence,” Gabriel said. “Basically, we made the program originally to celebrate students who have done well academically and have done some form of civic engagement toward the Wesleyan campus.” University President Michael Roth praised the efforts of Gabriel and Pennant. He said he believes the awards ceremony is a way to unite members of the University community. “The best part about it is that it’s a student initiative,” Roth said. “It’s meant to help build community and to recognize people who are being helpful in that endeavor.” Vice President for Institutional Partnerships and Chief Diversity Officer Sonia Mañjon supported both Gabriel and Pennant with their endeavors. Mañjon noted that the University needs an occassion such as this to contrast with recent events. “[I learned about the ceremony] right after the big scenario that happened at the Connecticut Science Center with the senior class,” Mañjon said. “So I’m thinking we need to do something that’s on campus, that’s not an opportunity for students to just drink and pass out and get drunk…So I am very much supportive of the idea and impressed with what they [have] done in the short amount of time that they’ve had to coordinate it.” The awards ceremony will honor two freshmen, two sophomores, two juniors, and eight seniors. The organizers plan to use results from various surveys in the future to refine the program in years to come. “We’re really hoping that this will turn into a tradition and grow larger,” Gabriel said. Ten to twelve faculty and staff will receive awards for their advisory roles for students. “We know that there are a lot of students who have been under a faculty or staff member who have pointed them in the right direction, [and] kept them encouraged through their years, or throughout some time,” Pennant said. “Or, if they didn’t do it, then they at least pointed [the students] in the right direction as to who to go to.” Gabriel and Pennant believe it is important to include all class years in the event, so that everyone in the community has a specific goal toward which to work. They hope that underclassmen will recognize and act on behalf of the greater needs of the University community. “We wanted to make sure to include freshman and sophomores, because when [they] come in…they don’t have this idea that you have got to buckle down,” Pennant said. “…We really believe that recognition brings about more encouragement for people to do better and it holds them accountable for their actions.” Students are nominated by faculty, staff, or fellow students; self-nomination is prohibited. Short blurbs accompany the nomination and final decisions are chosen by a jury committee of alumni who are at least five years removed from the graduating class. Students also vote for faculty and staff awards through an email survey. Gabriel said he hopes alumni engagement in both the voting process and the ceremony will help students foster connections for post-graduate plans. “By allowing [alumni] to come and interact with us in this celebration, [students] can really network, build connections, maybe even land a summer internship or help them land a certain connection that would help them find a future job,” Gabriel said. “This really gives a glimpse of what Wesleyan alumni are doing, how they have progressed from being students at Wesleyan to prominent alumni currently.” All students are encouraged to sign up for the event, although space is limited to about 30 students per class year. Tickets are $20, but faculty members can sponsor students. “We don’t need to be in the news again for destroying the science center,” Pennant said. “We don’t need to be in the news for Holi for the whole world to hear about us. We don’t need to be in the news again for the forum. We need something positive and we need everyone to keep experiencing the positive things at Wesleyan so that when they leave they actually enjoy being alumni.” Mañjon hopes this will encourage seniors to focus more on helping the community and each other. “I’m hoping…that they embark on senior activities that are more about giving back to the community,” Mañjon said. “Last year I worked with the senior class on an event in the spring where they literally worked with the community, the vendors on Main Street, to do a cleanup and to just bring visibility to the campus-community partnerships. It was a way for seniors to really recognize this larger community, not just Wesleyan, but Middletown, and really give back in their last year. So I’m hoping the senior classes will really look more towards these types of activities in the future.”"

		"title": "Middletown May Day Events Unify Community",
		"date": "2013-05-02",
		"authors": "by Stephanie Ling, Staff Writer",
		"content": "Dat Vu/Staff Photographer The first of May signified International Workers’ Day, and several University students, in conjunction with other Middletown residents, organized a variety of events in honor of the occasion. Planned events included the revitalization and reclaiming of a community garden located between Washington Street and Pearl Street, a teach-in at Middlesex Community College, and, to conclude the day, a citizens’ assembly in Spear Park at the intersection of William and Main Streets. The desire to organize these events came out of momentum resulting from  Occupy movements and community meetings, called encuentros, which also focused on community engagement. “It came out of a group of people who had been doing various different measures ever since Occupy started,” said activist Ross Levin ’15. “What inspired this May Day action was the desire to bring encuentro to the streets, and instead of having a private meeting, we’d have a public meeting and a lot of reaching out into Middletown.” Each of the May Day events was arranged through the efforts of different groups of people throughout the community. “We wanted to get in one big [movement] that really captured the sentiments of the people in our group, and a lot of people are angry about what is going on the in the world,” Levin said. “People shouldn’t be angry and frustrated in isolation, because a lot of other people are going through the same things, so before this semester ended, we wanted to get in one really good way for people to come together over these sorts of things.” A group of several Middletown residents involved in resisting the divestment of several Washington Street homes helped initiate the new garden project. The event description invited members of the community to “help revitalize a community garden that is under threat from the proposed strip mall construction” and help “reclaim space from private interests and cultivate it in service of our community.” Stephen Krevisky, a professor of mathematics at Middlesex Community College and community activist, predominantly organized the teach-in at the school, which featured several different speakers, including Joanne Sheehan of the War Resisters League, Stanley Heller of the Middle East Crisis Committee, and other Middletown activists. “We wanted to get people involved in a variety of forms of activism, and I think through these different gatherings—encuentros as we call them, or batista-style community gatherings—we can give people from the town and the colleges the chance to speak up about different social issues, be it war, the sequestering of budget cuts, or corporate takeovers,” Krevinsky explained. Krevinsky has been actively involved in activism for decades, participating in peace marches and sit-ins related to a variety of causes, including the protesting of the Vietnam and Iraq wars. Now, as a citizen of Middletown, he has wanted to create a similar environment of striving for change in the community. “We’ve been hoping to pull something together that could energize people, build community and dialogue, and make some things happen around here about a lot of issues that people care about,” Krevinsky said. The May Day events emphasized unifying groups of individuals of varying backgrounds through discussion of shared concerns and interests surrounding current happenings in the world. “For me, it’s really about building community and building a group of diverse people who are connected through the long term through these sorts of [sentiments],” Levin said. “These sorts of events have really come from the existence of that type of community that’s based in resisting oppression and injustice and working towards a better life for everyone.” The general citizens’ assembly that culminated the day of gatherings had a relaxed atmosphere and included free food. “Among the folks at the People’s Assembly, the workers might be concerned about wages, the students about debt, the poor folks about welfare, and the old folks about social security—but when we come together in dialogue with one another, we see that all our grievances are connected,” wrote participant Daniel Plafker ’15 in an email to The Argus. “Our seemingly disparate struggles are really one struggle against capitalist exploitation and the hierarchical state. No problem is an individual problem; these things are products of the structural elements within society.” According to Andrew Olson ’16, the environment was positive. He enjoyed meeting different members of the community and especially liked participating in constructive and insightful conversation. “May Day is about people coming together in the community,” Olsen said. “It was a good-natured sort of meeting, but people were talking about serious issues.” Olson described the assembly as hugely successful, and the group of attendees agreed to start a new tradition of meeting in the park every Friday to partake in similar discussions. “The more we spread our activism into Middletown, the better, and there is so much that we can learn from the citizens of Middletown.” Olson said. “Even if you don’t identify with their backgrounds or beliefs, they are so passionate, and it was an extremely positive experience that I came away feeling so energized from.” If the May Day proceedings are considered successful and spur more interest, Krevinsky and Levin foresee the reoccurrence of these events for future years. “I’m hoping that there could be more on-going connections between the Wesleyan campus, Middlesex Community College, and community people in the long run and in the short run,” Krevinsky said."

		"title": "Pumpkin Fest Welcomes Autumn, Fosters Community",
		"date": "2013-10-09",
		"authors": "by Jenny Davis, Staff Writer",
		"content": "Trisha Arora/Photo Editor Laura Cohen ’14, in overalls and braids, walked over to the long line of people waiting for free veggie burgers. “Marigolds?” she offered, and began passing out fresh yellow flowers. This Saturday, Long Lane Farm was milling with people attending its annual Pumpkin Fest. Elderly folks nodded along to the banjo tunes coming from the stage, young children wandered from stand to stand, and students snapped pictures at booths and stomped in the just-fallen leaves. Cohen was selling homemade baked goods, from whole-wheat bread with honey to slices of pumpkin pie, among other treats. “It’s awesome!” she said. “There are so many people from the community, kids, and professors here. There are great vibes.” Not even wasps could dampen the mood. “I bought homemade bread with apple jam, and it was really funny because there were wasps flying absolutely everywhere,” said Anastasia Almyasheva ’17. “The man putting jam onto my bread had wasps all over him, but he didn’t even care.” Almyasheva enjoyed visiting the other booths as well, which sold everything from smoothies to spices. “It was a good opportunity to try some of the farm’s produce,” she said. “The spice section was really cool, and I loved the crafts that they had. There were also a lot of little kids there, and it was a really joyous atmosphere.” Coady Johnson ’15 and Kate Enright ’15, along with other co-organizers, had been planning Pumpkin Fest since August; both spent the summer working on the farm. “Valerie Marinelli of the College of the Environment approached the group of students who were staying at Wesleyan and asked if any of us would like to volunteer to help plan the Pumpkin Fest,” Johnson said. “This was actually only my second Pumpkin Fest, since it was snowed out my freshman year due to the infamous Snowpocalypse.” Enright, who spearheaded the crafts and bake sales, was overjoyed with the feedback from visitors to the farm on Saturday. “I was mostly really happy with people’s reactions,” she said. “People said it was one of the most positive things they’d experienced at Wesleyan, which was a big deal.” Various environmental clubs, including the Climate Ambassadors, took advantage of Pumpkin Fest to set up booths informing the community about their work. Aly Raboff ’16, one of three student leaders of the Ambassadors, manned her station with the help of two small children from Middletown who sat on her table alternately drinking smoothies and asking questions. “We just started last semester,” Raboff said. “We’re here to talk about our group, and we have a little quiz going to get people interested.” A representative from Raw You-niverse, a Middletown organic food store, was serving up signature smoothies at a booth near the stage where bands were playing. “They asked us to come last year for the first time, and it was so much fun that we had to come back,” said Larry, the smoothie mixer. The sound of whirring blenders was just background noise to the bands performing on the central stage. The first to perform were the Highlanders, a folk group featuring Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts. “I’ve have a band on campus for the past 11 or 12 years,” Meerts said. “This is the latest incarnation. I play guitar, harmonica, and orchestrate with my feet. I also do vocals.” This was Meerts’ first Pumpkin Fest. “I like the farm, and I’m very engaged with it in my official capacity,” he said. “When there was a call out for people to perform, my group and I thought it might be fun.” And fun it was—even for those in charge. Though he was flipping free veggie burgers and painting faces for most of the day, Johnson was happy to observe the Fest. “It seemed like everyone was really enjoying themselves,” Johnson said. “My favorite part was seeing the kids from the Middletown Food Project [MFP]. MFP was a program we organized over the summer for families who had kids on the free lunch program at the Snow School….We all really bonded a lot, and it was great to see them at Pumpkin Fest with other people from their neighborhood, since it really is supposed to be open to everyone and not just people from Wesleyan.” Enright agreed that observing the community engagement was her favorite part of the Fest. “We all had these kids that we made friends with this summer,” she said. “It was great to see them at the Fest, having a lot of fun just being on the farm.”"

		"title": "Community Group Branches Out With Middletown Garden Initiatives",
		"date": "2013-10-10",
		"authors": "by Gabe Rosenberg, Assistant Features Editor",
		"content": "Xinyu Zhu/Contributing Photographer Behind Macdonough Elementary School in Middletown, a garden grows: leafy greens, bell peppers, tatsoi, sunflowers, and strawberries fill the space. Of course, this garden didn’t spring up from nowhere; it resulted from a collaboration among the University’s Middletown Urban GARDENS (MUG) group, the North End Action Team (NEAT), and the elementary school’s students and teachers. “We built a community garden behind Macdonough, took the children out there, got them involved in actually planting, watering, and tending to growing plants there, taught them a little about the lifecycle of plants, and exposed them to healthy food,” said James Carter ’14. By establishing community gardens at local elementary schools and in the north end of Middletown, MUG aims to promote nutritional education and foster a sense of community through the use of shared, sustainable space. After finishing a stint with AmeriCorps, Adin Vaewsorn ’15 wanted to focus his knowledge about community engagement into an effort to improve local relations between the University and the wider community. To this end, he and a few others decided on the goals of GARDENS, which stands for “Generating Agricultural Resources and Delivering Education on Nutrition in Schools.” Pierre Gerard/Contributing Photographer The idea of garden-based nutrition education, Vaewsorn said, fulfilled more than just one of his goals as a University student. “[It] was a thing I found I had a passion for, and I thought it would help establish relations between Wesleyan and Middletown,” he said. “It was a win-win in my mind.” In 2011, Vaewsorn spotted an empty lot on Ferry Street that was owned by a housing corporation but not in use at the time. NEAT, a grassroots community organization that had already built a successful community garden on Erin Street, had also been eyeing the lot as the location for a new public space. “It wasn’t the prettiest thing to look at, but it looked like a place that had so much potential,” Vaewsorn said. According to Pierre Gerard ’15, the garden also satisfied a need for connection within the incongruent Ferry Street area. Large apartments and the Wharfside Commons development, which consists of high-density residences with large turnover rates, surrounds the garden. “[We wanted to] create a space that people who are constantly coming and going can hold onto while they’re there,” Gerard said. NEAT acquired the property, and MUG provided the muscle to make some changes. According to Janika Oza ’15, the group cleaned up the trash, moved the rocks, used a brush mower to clear the five-foot-high weeds, and replaced the lead-laden soil with a healthy mulch of manure, woodchips, and cardboard. As for what to do with the space, MUG asked the community, believing that those who benefit most from shared spaces should have the final say in their use. Members of the group went door-to-door asking if households were interested in owning sections of the garden, and, if so, what they wanted to grow. “It was the kids who made the decisions,” Vaewsorn said. “They were very excited about their vegetables.” MUG then supplied the plants, receiving donations of discounted or free seeds from local stores. The resulting area is a mix of individually owned and managed plots, all of which are currently occupied, and a common area of four beds open to public consumption, which Middletown gardeners volunteer to maintain. The support of NEAT, which has a strong relationship with Middletown, proved instrumental to the involvement of North End residents in the project. “With an emphasis upon democratic neighborhood leadership and community coalition building on an issue-by-issue basis, NEAT has developed successful programs and initiatives aimed at responsible revitalization and has become a grassroots community organization dedicated to the development of indigenous participation and leadership within the North End neighborhood,” wrote NEAT Executive director Bobbye Peterson in an email to the Argus. The team was formed in 1997 in response to the area’s broad disinvestment, neighborhood violence, and widespread poverty, Peterson noted. NEAT makes its greatest impact in providing affordable housing redevelopments, and its experience with promoting public spaces made the garden project more doable. “[NEAT is] the pillar of support in the community that makes this possible,” Vaewsorn said. To further the impact of its nutritional efforts, however, the group makes sure to engage the children of local families in the gardening process. Carter said the elementary school program, which will move from Macdonough to Wilbert Snow Elementary School this semester, provides a necessary resource to students of low socioeconomic status. At Macdonough especially, a large fraction of students receive free or reduced lunches, so the garden supplements their nutritional education. “The quality of the food they’re experiencing at school and at home is fairly low,” Carter said. “A lot of the children don’t have exposure to vegetables in many forms, so we’ve actually harvested food from the garden there that they’ve planted and showed them how to cook it.  We had a little stir fry.” Carter has been working with the administration at Snow to set up a curriculum, with lessons about nutrition labels and the values of different processed foods complementing the garden-based activities. At Macdonough, Carter found, the children responded best to hands-on approaches to learning, and the garden fueled their excitement for learning about and caring for plants. “They really like to get out there and run around through the garden,” Carter said. “For whatever reason, watering became the highlight activity for them; watering and eating, mostly.” Members of MUG said they were inspired by how engaged community members became in their newly created space. “I was most impressed by how much the gardeners cared about the garden individually,” Gerard said. The volunteer gardeners acted as community leaders, and once the project got off the ground in May, MUG realized it no longer had to intervene in the day-to-day necessities of watering and caring for the plants and common area. “Our Ferry Street gardeners have more or less taken over the garden,” Carter said. “They’re responsible for running things, and they just let us know if something is not working out well, and we’ll help them with that.” Especially over the summer, Middletown residents provide the bulk of the garden’s continuing operations. “[MUG] opened up the space for them to organize themselves,” Vaewsorn said. The gradual move away from student management further secures the future of the Ferry Street garden and provides encouragement for both MUG and NEAT to search for more abandoned or blighted lots to convert. “Wesleyan students often do not live in Middletown for the entire year and often leave after they graduate, so it is crucial that the Middletown residents involved have a major stake in the project so that it can be sustainable,” wrote Keren Reichler ’16 in an email to the Argus. The elementary school programs prove a greater challenge in terms of sustainability. While the Macdonough garden continues to thrive, without the involvement of University students, the educational aspects require outside help. “The teachers aren’t paid to do these programs, so we have to show up there and provide the manpower,” Carter said. Now that its roots are planted, MUG plans to branch out. Oza said the group looks to expand its infrastructure by building a small stage or fire pit in the Ferry Street lot. Members also plan to hold more events for the community, including a pickling workshop with the garden’s green tomatoes and a flower-bulb-planting day. And, of course, MUG strives to pinpoint what the community wants for its garden. So far, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. “Everybody loves the idea of something that could bring people in a seemingly disparate area together,” Gerard said."

		"title": "Back With A Vengeance: Art House Brings Creative Energy To Washington Street",
		"date": "2013-10-14",
		"authors": "by Cecilia Cereijido-Bloche, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "Trisha Arora/Photo Editor When the Office of Residential Life (ResLife) sent a message out to students last fall encouraging them to submit proposals for the creation of a new program house, Gabe Gordon ’15 and Genna DeGroot ’15 stepped up. What did they want in the place of Interfaith House? They longed for a re-imagining of the infamous Art House. When they sent the application in for the proposed program house, they labeled it “Studio House.” They feared that calling it Art House would increase its chances of rejection because the former Art House, once located at 69 High Street, was dismantled in 2003. In 2000, The New York Times published an article titled “Naked Dorm? That Wasn’t in the Brochure,” which labeled labeled West College (WestCo) a “naked dorm.” In the article, former Art House manager Michael Bodel ’03 spoke highly of naked parties, a social event for which the house was known. Some students speculate that the house’s affinity for nudity was one of the primary reasons behind its demise. “I don’t know the official reason why, but I know ResLife decided Art House was done,” Gordon, the Art House manager, said. “They lived in this beautiful house, throwing too many parties and causing too much trouble.” After the application for Studio House was accepted, ResLife agreed that it would be a better idea to call it Art House. Art House’s current mission statement on the University’s website is almost identical to the old iteration’s. Both describe the nurturing of a space where all art can be created, displayed, and discussed. Both emphasize the importance of being open-minded and inclusive of art created by anyone on campus. “What I want Art House to be more than anything is a place where people won’t be judged for having ideas,” Gordon wrote in an email to the Argus. “I know I often struggle with finding the confidence to take hold of the creative thoughts I come across, act on them, and put them to life….The Art House community, by being supportive of the work of each other, fosters the initiative to act on creative impulse.” So far, the new iteration of Art House has been a widespread success in attracting students with varied interests. Gordon described the current residents as a diverse collective of students. “We are NOT a house full of Art majors,” he wrote. “We are filmmakers, musicians, dancers, writers, actors, marine biologists, etc.” Art House has already had numerous social events that have established its place within the broader campus community. At its first concert, the Housewarming Show on Sept. 14, student performances included an improv-folk group, a funk-rap band, and a Beatles cover band. Since then, Art House has hosted several other artists. On Oct. 5, they welcomed Lust-Cats of the Gutters, an indie band from Brooklyn, Mannequin Pussy, a Denver-based fuzz-punk band, and a student duo called The Murdertones. Though concerts are clearly a large part of the house’s focus, its residents strive to present a wider variety of the arts, and even to combine them. Gordon hopes that people will come for the concerts and be drawn in to the Art House community by the visual art on display. The first floor is still decorated with art from the Housewarming Show in September, which drew from campus-wide submissions. In addition to student art, residents of Art House hang cat images up on the walls whenever a resident has achieved anything, whether it be a social or academic accomplishment. Art House’s mission to wrap students into a creative haven extends beyond nightlife. Residents use the house as a rehearsal space, and Gordon hopes to hold a short play series there in the future. This past weekend, Art House hosted a 24-hour comic book marathon during which paper and drawing supplies were provided for anyone who wanted to create comics. Finally, contributors created one big comic that its contributors hope to show to the rest of the student body. The house also hosted an event where students were invited to draw nude models. Beyond mixing with other students and planning events with other houses, members of Art House have demonstrated a desire to mix with the world beyond the University. Gordon has plans for the house to participate in outreach programs and host guest speakers. “Community engagement through art is one of the biggest elements of our mission, so we are definitely going to be reaching out around campus and Middletown to get projects going in that direction,” Gordon wrote. “Our amazing faculty advisor is Kate TenEyck, the Art Department’s Studio Technician and professor. She is heavily involved in Wesleyan and Middletown’s art scenes and is an amazing resource.” It’s clear that the revived Art House has its hopes to be a friendly and welcoming environment for people of all persuasions, removed from the older iteration’s rowdy reputation. “While Art House likes to make noise (through our concerts and performances, gatherings, laughter), we consider ourself a safe and comfortable space,” Gordon wrote. “The building is large and shared with Lighthouse, but it feels like a home to both groups.”"

Students that are are unable to return home or who are simply interested in the programs will be able to participate in a community service trip through Habitat for Humanity or to engage in local community service in the Middletown community. The ASB program will be sponsored by the University and will seek to encourage community engagement. The main organizer of the program, Bruno Machiavelo Tinoco ’16, explained that when he recognized that the University did not have any ASB programs, he was determined to help create one. Machiavelo Tinoco, who serves on the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) Student Affairs Committee, published a committee update on the WSA website on Oct. 14 explaining the program. “Unfortunately, Wesleyan does not have any institutionalized, recurring, and consistent ASB program,” Machiavelo Tinoco wrote. “So, I did what any WSA member would do: I set out to change this. After many meetings with relevant administrators and students, Wesleyan’s ASB program was born.” Machiavelo Tinoco added that these options will be especially beneficial for international students, for whom it is particularly difficult to leave campus. “As a previously international student, I had a lot of trouble finding things to do during school breaks while others were off gallivanting around the United States and/or visiting home,” Machiavelo Tinoco wrote. “This was especially true during spring break, especially due to the fact that we have two whole weeks off. Through talking with a lot of my international friends that now attend American universities, I learned that a lot of them were participating in their school’s ‘Alternative Spring Break’ program.” A survey provided by the WSA indicated that many students at the University, both international and domestic, expressed interest in having these sorts of alternative spring break options. For student groups whose mission would benefit from a trip that would be difficult to schedule while school is in session, spring break also provides an excellent opportunity. Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Whaley expressed his excitement about the program. “I am fully supportive of offering some service options to students interested in spending a portion of the recess working on community service projects,” Whaley wrote in an email to The Argus. Coordinator for the on-campus chapter of Habitat for Humanity Alex Drexler ’16 said that he has been planning to organize a trip for Habitat for Humanity since his freshman year. According to Drexler, the details for this trip are still being finalized, but the trip’s itinerary will entail working on building a specific house from Monday to Thursday and then having time off on Friday and Saturday to explore the area. “It is very open,” he said. “It is going to depend on who ends up wanting to go, how many people we have, and how far we are willing to travel.” As for the domestic alternative spring break program, students are organizing a one-week program through the Hunger and Homelessness student group. Group leader Francesca Moree ’14 explained that students who choose to attend this will remain on campus throughout spring break. “Time is long overdue for Wesleyan students to engage in an alternative spring break,” Moree wrote in a message to The Argus. Students who choose this trip will either work on various projects in Middletown or select one larger project to complete throughout the week. Machiavelo Tinoco is hopeful that ASB will prove as popular as the WSA survey suggested it might be. “Personally, I think that students will [take advantage of the program], especially international students,” Machiavelo Tinoco said. “I probably would have gone on an alternative spring break trip if it had been available.” In the future, ASB may not be limited to the two options available this year: Drexler hopes this program will grow over the years, possibly offering a larger array of alternative trips to students. “As far as Alternative Spring Break trips go as a whole, I am really excited about getting more of them put together,” Drexler said. Machiavelo Tinoco added that this trip provides a unique opportunity for many students at the University to get involved with the Middletown community as well as communities elsewhere. “Hopefully we get a good turnout and the trip is successful, fun, and very beneficial for the community,” Machiavelo Tinoco said."

		"title": "Students and Parents Attend Annual COE Symposium",
		"date": "2013-11-04",
		"authors": "by Hilary Brumberg, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "On Saturday, Nov. 2, the College of the Environment (COE) held its annual symposium, “Where on Earth are We Going?”, which featured guest lecturer Deborah Bird Rose and Distinguished Visiting Scholar in the College of the Environment Frédérique Apffel-Marglin ’66. Bird Rose gave a lecture titled “Kinship with Nature in the Time of Loss: Can Animism Help Revitalize the Commons?”, while Frédérique Apffel-Marglin’s lecture was called “Re-imagining the Commons: Natural Resource Management or Biocultural Generation?” Each symposium focuses on that year’s COE Think Tank topic. Director of the College of the Environment and Chair of the Environmental Studies Program Barry Chernoff spoke about the importance of this symposium. “We’ve had very impressive speakers over the years,” Chernoff said. “It is important for our students to get exposed to leading speakers in the environmental field and exposed to unique, cutting-edge voices from outside Wesleyan. It gives our students a chance to test ideas and learn different points of view, even if they disagree. We want our students to engage in the critical issues of our time.” The COE holds “Where on Earth are We Going?” over Homecoming/Family Weekend so that parents and alumni can attend the event as well as students. Chernoff commented on the diverse nature of the symposium’s sponsors, which include the Baldwin University Lectures, the Mellon Fund for Lectures, the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, the Science in Society Program, the Animal Studies Reading Group, Center for the Americas, the Anthropology Department, and the History Department. “The amount of groups and departments sponsoring the event shows that the issues we’re dealing with really affect a lot of people at the university,” Chernoff said. Bird Rose’s talk focused on how her work with Aboriginal people has helped her better understand animism, which she defined as humans’ relationship with all natural objects, including plants, animals, rivers and rocks. “Animism can help us to revitalize our capacity to understand ourselves and our place in the world to restore us to a sense of humanity,” she said. She explained that animism makes life meaningful because it allows people to realize that birds have ceremonies of their own and plants have their own cultures and kinships. “What does it take to live in a culture where other beings are bumping up against you?” Bird Rose asked. “You’re not bumping up against inanimate objects.” She told the story of Australian porcupine hunter, Snowy Kulmilya, who uses a boomerang to slay porcupines. He sees porcupines as intelligent, tricky beings, and consequently talks to them when he hunts them. “You need to acknowledge the multiple knowledges in the universe,” Rose said. “Where the human knowledge stops is not the end of knowledge.” Commenting on the topic of this year’s Think Tank, Bird Rose explained that the entire biosphere is a common space, shared by all. “There should not be property questions, but belonging questions,” she said. “We belong to it; it doesn’t belong to us. It isn’t ours to trash and throw away.” After her lecture, Bird Rose explained why it is important for young people, like University students, to learn about issues such as animism and the commons. “You’re the ones who will have to live through a world of tough changes,” Bird Rose said. “You need inspiration and resources and an awareness of a diverse human experience.” Apffel-Marglin spoke in front of a photograph of the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration, which she founded in 2009, in the Peruvian High Amazon. She analyzed the word biocultural, which comprises the roots for the words nature and humanity. “Nature and humans are always entangled,” she said. Apffel-Marglin showed a short video clip of two boys in Bolivia praying to and discussing the merits of El Tio, who is said to protect miners and eat men. She also explained the idea of moral economy, which, she stated, is humans’ responsibility to the nonhuman world. After her lecture, Apffel-Marglin explained that her goal is to motivate young people to take action. “Thinking is great, but not sufficient,” she said. “If people only do with their minds and don’t connect learning with activities, it’s very problematic.” Apffel-Marglin’s suggested that one remedy to this problem for University students is to work on Long Lane Farm and do other activities with real-world applications. “Long Lane Farm shouldn’t be an elective or a side thing; it should be incorporated into the curriculum,” she said. “There are some community engagement courses, but they are few and far between. Courses should have a hands-on aspect.” Ross Levin ’15 said that he enjoyed Apffel-Marglin’s presentation. “She was able to make connections between types of knowledge and how people relate to each other,” Levin said. “It was exciting that there is a new type of economy, which is at the center of what Frédérique was talking about.”"

		"title": "Middletown Potluck Bridges Community Through Social Events",
		"date": "2013-11-04",
		"authors": "by Kirsten Rischert-Garcia,",
		"content": "“Freshman year, I spent a lot of time in the triangle between my dorm room, Usdan, and the library,” said Ari Ebstein ’16. “When you’re in that loop, it all feels very significant, [but] what does my paper on popular culture and social justice really mean when people are homeless and sleeping on the street in Middletown?” Ebstein and Bulelani “Jills” Jili ’16 began thinking about how to make social change a more constant part of their lives while they were living in 200 Church last year. In the spring, they worked together to form Middletown Potluck with the goal of strengthening ties between Wesleyan students and Middletown residents. The potlucks have been held in partnership with the Green Street Arts Center and aim to facilitate fruitful conversations about social justice over a shared meal. “Wesleyan students are a tad aloof, a bit in our own world,” Jili said. “When you converse, [you might hear], ‘I’m going into Middletown.’ You are in Middletown.” Evan Bieder ’15 agrees that Wesleyan students tend to detach themselves from the greater community. He has tried to combat this issue through volunteering with Middletown Potluck, Food Not Bombs, and Middletown Urban Gardens. “I think a lot of Wesleyan students can get stuck in the Wesleyan bubble and only really experience Middletown on Main Street through the restaurants and frozen yogurt and things like that,” Bieder said. “I am trying to make a bigger effort to interact with the town I am living in for four years.” Efforts to strengthen the relationship between Wesleyan and Middletown have also been increasing on an institutional level. For example, this September, the University hosted its inaugural celebration of Middletown Day, which brought members of the Middletown community to the Wesleyan campus for an afternoon of festivities. It is up for debate, however, whether or not these efforts have been successful at reducing town-gown tensions. “When people talk about tension, we talk about the idea that we have this very wealthy, privileged institution, literally on an elevated landscape, that employs a lot of the greater community as kind of a service class, sometimes in serviceable working conditions and sometimes not, and often [Wesleyan] is criticized for not engaging in more partnership with the community,” Ebstein said. “I think a lot of the activism Wesleyan touts about itself and [which] students engage in is of a paternalistic nature, such as tutoring or food rescue. These things are important, and I’m not trying to criticize these things unilaterally, but they do come from a hierarchical position of Wesleyan as this bastion of privilege and abundance.” Ebstein and Jili said they are making an effort to go about social activism in less paternalistic and hierarchical ways and to involve the Middletown community as much as possible in the decision-making process. In fact, it was Middletown resident Nur Moebius who came up with the idea of having a potluck while talking to Ebstein at a celebratory barbeque for Middletown Urban Gardens. Moebius was one of three speakers at the Middletown Potluck’s first event, “The Middletown Experience,” along with Arthur Moore, a ninth grade student with an interest in spoken word, and Jalen Alexander ’14, coordinator for the Traverse Square tutoring program. “Middletown Potluck is unique in that its focus is social,” Jili said. “We are a group of equals trying to come [together] to make a change.” The Halloween Bash, held at Green Street Arts Center on Oct. 27 and co-sponsored by Middletown Potluck and Green Street, was originally suggested by Middletown resident and parent Beverly Morris. More than 50 children came to the event, and 7 Wesleyan students helped out with the various activities on the schedule, including finger painting and drawing, a freeze dance game, and a chocolate mud-pie station that introduced kids to the idea of composting. One highlight of the night was the haunted house, decorated by After School Supervisor at Green Street Cookie Quiñones. “We are trying to see if next year we can make it even bigger,” Quiñones said. “We want to hear the voices of the community, and we will try our best to make [what they want] happen.” Middletown parent Marilyn Dunkley attended the Halloween event with her kids and plans to attend Middletown Potluck’s next event on Saturday, Nov. 16, from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at First Church, 190 Court St. This potluck will be in collaboration with St. Vincent de Paul’s Amazing Grace Food Pantry and will feature speeches from several formerly or currently homeless people as a way to fuel a discussion on hunger and homelessness in the Middletown community. “We were hit by the economy and layoffs,” Dunkley said. “I have six kids and we go to Amazing Grace [Food Pantry] to get assistance. Middletown is very unique; we are all connected and [people are] willing to help out whenever you need something.” Although Green Street-affiliated families made up the largest portion of “Halloween Bash” attendees, an eclectic mix of people typically attends Middletown Potluck events. Attendees include homeless people from the Eddy Shelter, Wesleyan students, an old-school Marxist named Vick, Green Street administrators, and Middlesex Community College students. Lately, Ebstein and Jili have been reaching out to more faith-based communities and are also trying to encourage more professors to attend and to contribute food to the potluck. “One problem is that we are feeding more of a food-insecure population… [and it could be] offensive to expect a resident of the Eddy shelter to bring food, so we’ve been dimming the potluck aspect,” Ebstein said. So far, Wesleyan students have cooked most of the meals, with Middletown residents contributing several dishes and Mike’s Deli providing sandwiches on occasion. Ebstein hopes to get more restaurants to agree to donate food, one of many goals he has for the future of Middletown Potluck. “I would like to get involved in a local issue of social justice, and use the community facilitated by Middletown Potluck to help out in a significant way in providing partial solutions to issues pertaining to social justice,” Ebstein said. “Whether that is homeless[ness], food insecurity, or educational inequity, they are all part of the same soup.”"

		"title": "Students, WesDEFs Address Issues in Wesleyan-Middletown Relations",
		"date": "2013-11-07",
		"authors": "by Madeleine Stern, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "Students gathered in 41 Wyllys on Wednesday, Nov. 6 for an open forum about the relationship between the University and the greater Middletown community. Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitators (WesDEFs) Keren Reichler ’16, Alexandra Ricks ’16, and Janika Oza ’15 facilitated the forum, which was informally titled “Us and Them.” Oza did not identify any specific events as part of WesDEF’s motivation for organizing the forum, pointing instead to a more general need to open a conversation about the Wesleyan-Middletown relationship. “During orientation we were coming up with possible topics to address this year, and this came up as something that was definitely worth discussing,” Oza said. Reichler added that she, Ricks, and Oza each has a personal interest in the topic. “This was important for us because [the three of us] all work, volunteer, or are otherwise engaged with the wider community in some way,” Reichler said. The forum drew about 25 students, many of whom are also involved with community engagement initiatives on campus. To begin the meeting, facilitators asked attendees to ponder the roots of any animosity between students and Middletown residents. Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Catherine Lechowicz attributed the rift in part to a lack of understanding of the Office of Public Safety’s jurisdiction on campus. “[There are] potentially unstated policies about how people, either Public Safety or others, have approached people on campus,” Lechowicz said. “Incidents don’t always involve town people; sometimes they’re student-on-student. They’re just part of society. It’s a difficult question, then, of ensuring that campus resources are available to everyone in the community while maintaining a safe campus.” Another subject of discussion was the University’s campus climate;  students generally agreed that there is room for improvement. A common point of concern was the attitude that many students hold toward Middletown and its residents. “It seems to me more and more that there are barriers within the student body itself,” said Shira Engel ’14, who heads the Woodrow Wilson Tutoring Partnership. Adin Vaewsorn ’15 agreed that the way many University students conceive of their relationships with the city around them could stand to improve. “Students tend to primarily have service-based interactions with Middletown,” Vaewsorn said. “[Engaging with the community] tends to become less of a process and more one-sided.” Abel Sandoval ’15 echoed Vaewsorn’s sentiments. “Whether it’s from in the community or from outside, [University students] are viewed as being in an elite position,” Sandoval said. “Sometimes I feel like I’m being put on a pedestal…but I would say a lot of Wesleyan students view themselves that way as well.” Ari Ebstein ’16 speculated that the topography of the University and the surrounding community contributes to these perceptions. “Since we’re up here on this hill, sometimes it’s sort of this attitude of, ‘We’re up here, and they’re down there,’” Ebstein said. However, participants in the forum expressed hope for improved town-gown relations. Engel reflected on her own perception of Middletown over the course of her time at the University. “Since my freshman year, Middletown, in my mind, has become so much larger,” Engel said. “I’ve realized that I was defining ‘city’ in such a limited, limiting way…. There’s definitely a lack of awareness. People who don’t necessarily work with populations outside of Wesleyan are exactly the people who need to be exposed to this kind of discussion.” “We tend to forget…but there’s a whole other world out there, and there’s so much happening,” she said. Ebstein offered up a simple but surprising tip for students. “A year or two ago, [Wesleyan] did a survey where they asked Middletown residents, ‘What’s the number one thing Wesleyan students could do to improve their relationship with Middletown?’” he said. “You know what the answer was? Crosswalks. We need to use the crosswalks around campus.”"

		"title": "Open Letter to President Roth",
		"date": "2014-02-18",
		"authors": "by Martin Benjamin,",
		"content": "Dear Valentine, The Substance of President Washington’s Thanksgiving Proclamation (“Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor, and Whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me ‘to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed…’”) fails to appear in yours.  But, hey, it isn’t every Hobbit on High who can honestly claim to be substance-free.  You deem the Founders’ Touchstone untouchable, easily less pronounceable than supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Alas, your reluctance to declare the Substance of Thanksgiving calls to mind the pot calling the kettle black.  You cluck: “The newspapers have squeezed out even more substance to make room for advertising…”  And what, pray tell, was YOUR blog doing?  “…the Wesleyan Fund is conducting a one-day campaign to support our alma mater through contributions.  Your gift through the Fund, no matter how small, helps the university with its current needs, including financial aid.” You oblige the students to gift the Fund, as “…we (should) turn our attention away from buying stuff we may not need…”  “We”?   Where’s YOUR kick-off gift?  You say my request is unusual?  It is, but no more unusual than yours.  Before your formative era (the Sixties and Seventies) hit the fan, Old Wes obliged the students to work to the max in a wholly monastic enclave set in a rundown, backwater town that barely forbore the gown.  We house-boys on High (a dozen lettered Greeks) competed scholastically, high-grade competition paying off in high-grade earnings AFTER graduation, when Old Grads would plow back bumper-year earnings into improving Alma Mater’s unlittered – repeat: unlittered – estate.  Your putting the harvest season ahead of the growing season is something new in the art of cultivation. Regarding what you call “the stuff we may not need” – the hot and cold confections, the soundtracks, whatever, – one soundtrack this verbally guarded schoolyard’s children do NOT need is a Chief Diversity Officer, a schoolyard scold employed by the schoolyard bully.  You urge the students to cheer the new scold’s arrival.  I, for one, shall forgive them if they don’t, for they had no say in the purchase they’ll be paying for.  It wouldn’t cost you a penny to call it “social justice,” and if you get caught with your hand in their pocket, like Barry the Fleecer and Document-shredder, you probably will. You wish to move on?  Dear Valentine, your wish is my command. Ere you’d beaten the substantive stuffing out of the holy day of Thanksgiving, last September the very threshold of Olin was the recipient of a basting, courtesy of hollerfest MASH.  That unlicensed assault-weapon’s evident mission: to drive every thought of grave skullduggery out of circulation one whole week after classes began.  Argus arts editor Gwendolyn Rosen conveys the scene: “I began my Mash experience in SciLi, begrudgingly trying to do some of my homework before all of the fun started.  My concentration broke once I saw from the Fishbowl that President Michael Roth was rocking out with Smokin’ Lillies in front of Olin.  If the president is enjoying the sunshine, there is no better sign that you should abandon your reading to join the music.”  No better sign, that sign you stuck on the lawn in front of Olin. And you would make your MASH a yearly affair.  Must make a note of that: an annual mosh top-billing Mike the Rock, the lyricist whose compositions are stuck in the key of I (“I recently reviewed…”  “I read…”  “I met…” “I viewed…”  “I spoke…”  “And then I wrote…”).  The student body’s mental circuits need another circuit-breaker as badly as you need another I-key. And speaking of beating and basting, you have not yet begun to fight.  Soon you’ll be deleting from its lovely setting Art History’s bibliotheque.  It had too much piquant charm to survive your envy-driven pique.  Your wrecking ball would have trashed Shanklin, had the Market’s crash not erased the funds to replace it with a fitting companion to Exley, the campus’s ugliest structure till Patricelli Pavilion hove into view and staved off a later bid for that honor by Bennet Hall. The students call the Pavilion “the gas station” – an inspired call.  I call it President Douglas J. “Bigfoot” Bennet’s trademark tread-mark stomped on the chiseled face of Brownstone Row.  Doug’s idolatrous Board of Philistines (“What do WE know?”), in panic mode – a prankster had hidden their rubber stamp – until they found it, gave their ritual blessing to record fundraiser Bennet’s project, into the bargain sacrificing (yea, burning up) Art History’s faculty (“What do THEY know?”), aghast at Bigfoot’s foot on the gas. And now it’s deconstructionist Roth’s turn.  Will he complete Old Wes’s effacement within his tenure’s remaining six years?  (“And in the seventh year Roth rested.”)  Michael, first make certain Thanksgiving had been completely effaced.  Yes, you’d managed to park that holy day’s Inspiration in the trash (and that’s no ordinary, fixable parking ticket), but more could be done. Begin with a killer sound bite.  The Mayflower could be rechristened La fleur du mal (don’t mention it), but even you would rue the day – the day your fellow apaches pour over the left bank onto La rue de la paix in war paint.  You’d greet them, ejaculating “Frere Jacques, La fleur du mal est formiDABle!”  They’d heave a despairing sigh: “Another transatlantic expatriot, carried away by the clime, succumbs to Seine-stroke.” Michael, you need to get out of the Seine and give nativism a chance.  Do me the favor of showing that blooming import the compost heap, and I’ll reciprocate: I’ll feed your scrawny Thanksgiving turkey’s lede a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious sound bite.  Hark! the summary wintry remark of a wretchedly tribal apache, the first to have sighted the Pilgrims disembarking: “Palefaces.  There goes the neighborhood.” Benjamin is a member of the class of 1957."

		"title": "Startup Showcase To Feature Alumni Work",
		"date": "2014-04-30",
		"authors": "by Jenny Davis, Assistant Opinion Editor",
		"content": "On Sunday, May 4, the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship will welcome four alumni and one group of current students to present at the Spring Alumni Startup Showcase. The event will be held in the Olson Commons in the Career Center. “Our hope is that events like this will give students an inside look at startup culture and illuminate some pros and cons of working in a small, entrepreneurial setting,” Director of the Patricelli Center Makaela Kingsley ’98 wrote in an email to The Argus. “We also aim to connect students directly with alumni and cultivate a community of innovative Wesleyan people across generations.” Sunday’s participants are Art Feltman ’80, Founder of International Hartford; Ysette Guevara ’98, Founder and CEO of Minds on Fire; Liza Conrad ’11, Fundraising and Operations Manager of Girls Who Code; Zach Valenti ’12, Founder and CEO of Project Uplift and Beastly Productions; and Kwaku Akoi ’14, Founder of JóòMah. JóòMah, the sole group consisting of current students, was founded by Akoi last year. His team includes Sam Giagtzoglou ’16, Oladoyin Oladapo ’14, Olayinka Lawal ’15, Maxwell Dietz ’16, Geofery Yatich ’16, and Michael Yee ’14. JóòMah, a web platform that connects job seekers in Sub-Saharan Africa to employment opportunities near them, has been in development since last June. Though it is a relatively recent startup, Akoi anticipates that it will have an enormous effect in Sub-Saharan Africa and potentially in other regions. “We’re looking at a culture of employment that’s going to change,” Akoi said. “We’re hoping to tackle the problem of accessibility to jobs. If someone could sit on a bus, looking for job opportunities on their phone, receiving notifications from employers who might be looking for them, it’s democratizing the process. We are leveling the playing field for all job seekers so that it will no more be the ones from big-name schools or with powerful relatives who will have access to the best job opportunities out there.” Moreover, Akoi pointed out, connecting job seekers to employers and vice versa will have a widespread impact on the economy. “Giving someone a better job opportunity gives them more income mobility,” he said. “Giving them access to better income would transfer into better revenues for the African governments in terms of taxes. People could save more, too, and afford better education and better healthcare. I want to see JóòMah become a new and more effective way of combating poverty, which is endemic in many African countries.” Valenti, Founder and CEO of Project Uplift and Beastly Productions, is also hoping to bring about a culture shift, this one focused around mental health. “I think about [Project Uplift] as a mental health awareness campaign, and primarily what we do is bring a massive biofeedback-powered tower that we built,” Valenti said. “We guide people in a mindfulness exercise that cultivates the breath. Within a few minutes, users trigger the fan at the base to turn on, and that lifts up the planet earth beach ball. By uplifting yourself, you physically lift up the world.” Though Project Uplift is just one of Valenti’s enterprises, he has big dreams for the still-growing event service. “From the beginning, my vision was to do a national tour in a rock ‘n’ roll tour bus with a swath of professionals in different fields, from behavior therapy to yoga,” Valenti said. “The intention is to lessen the stigma and raise awareness about existing resources on college campuses. I kept hearing how much they’re spending and the amazing array of resources that are available, but the engagement isn’t correlating.” Akoi stressed that the journey to entrepreneurship is a personal one: he realized the need for a company like JóòMah when he went back to his native Ghana after his sophomore year and witnessed firsthand the difficulty that talented job seekers faced in finding employment. Instead of dispensing advice, he sees encouraging younger entrepreneurs as his most important duty to those beginning to consider a startup. “More than great advice or insight, the big thing is for them to be encouraged, inspired,” he said. “It’s not easy. It requires a lot of perseverance, focus, and drive to keep going in spite of setbacks. Feeling discouraged kills a person’s drive and passion very quickly.” Valenti agreed that supporting young entrepreneurs at this weekend’s showcase is crucial. “I am really looking forward to giving hope that it’s totally possible,” he said. “Connecting with students who have big dreams and giving them access to how to execute things while staying as sane as possible is important. Burnout in the startup world is really high, because people throw themselves full force into ventures with no guarantee of success.” Civic Engagement Fellow Jelisa Adair ’13 explained that the Patricelli Center tries to strike a delicate balance between bringing alumni back to campus and launching students’ projects out into the world. “It has to be both, and so far it has been both,” she said. “One thing you’ll realize once you leave Wes is that you’re inducted into a realm of alumni. Not many people get a job from just applying. It’s who you know. Getting alumni back not only allows them to connect with students who are here, but also gives them something to latch onto, new experiences to connect to.” Adair also sees potential for the showcase’s presenters to act as mentors for students. “If you go to your friends, they’ll tell you the same things over and over,” she said. “You need people who can think critically and help the project grow. [The presenters] come back because they know there’ll be student interaction. Mentorship is easier to give than financial support or a job. I definitely saw that happen at our last showcase, and I hope to see it happen again.” Kingsley pointed out that student entrepreneurs stand to gain a lot by connecting with their older, more experienced, counterparts. “Student entrepreneurs face the same challenges as all entrepreneurs: proving that their idea fills an existing need in an innovative way, finding key allies and collaborators, compiling resources, and remaining nimble while staying true to the mission—to name just a few,” she wrote. “Students have the added challenge of juggling their entrepreneurial work with their academic pursuits—which is no easy feat. This event is just one of many ways that students with an interest in or curiosity about entrepreneurship can find support to weather these challenges.”"

		"title": "University Creates Equity Compliance Director Position",
		"date": "2014-05-01",
		"authors": "by Matt Shelley-Reade, Staff Writer",
		"content": "The University is introducing a new full-time position in the Office of Equity and Inclusion, the Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator. The new employee will be responsible for ensuring that the University’s policies and practices comply with Title IX, Title VII, and other Equal Opportunity laws at both the federal and state levels. The search has currently been narrowed to three candidates: Catherine Rombeau, Lance Houston and Deborah Colucci. Title IX of the Educational Amendments Acts of 1972 prohibits educational institutions from discriminating on the basis of sex, while Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, religion, sex, or ethnicity. “The Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator will coordinate, conduct informal and formal investigations, provide and monitor training programs with respect to equal opportunity and discrimination issues,” the Careers at Wesleyan website reads. This past week, the University hosted separated forums for each candidate. Rombeau spoke on Friday, April 25; Houston spoke Wednesday, April 30; and Colucci spoke yesterday, May 1. Each forum had the same structure, beginning with an introduction of the candidate, followed by a Title VII and Title IX training session, and finally concluded with a Q&A section. Community participation was encouraged in both the candidate search process and open forums. Vice President for Equity and Inclusion and Title IX Officer Antonio Farias headed the search committee, which was comprised of Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students Rick Culliton, WSA Student Affairs Committee Chair Kate Cullen ’16, Director of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Jennifer D’Andrea, and Interim Captain of Public Safety Paul Verrillo. Farias commented on the process of choosing a candidate and on the format of the open forum. “This is the Wesleyan process,” Farias said. “…For the the director level, you go through the full day process, and you have a community discussion…. I think for the community, particularly with this issue right now—Title VII and Title IX—it’s a hyper salient conversation, so it makes sense to have an open forum discussion. There’s also a certain level of skill the search committee wants to see in person—the performative aspect of the job.” Cullen spoke to the importance of community engagement in regard to the Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator, a position that will undoubtedly deal with sexual assault on campus. “I expect a good student turnout as sexual assault and Title IX is a hot issue on campus,” Cullen wrote in an email to The Argus. “I also hope we can engage in a meaningful dialogue with the candidates since this truly is an important job that will hopefully have a big impact on campus.” D’Andrea commented on the search process, explaining the qualifications they were looking for in each candidate. “The university conducted a national search to identify qualified candidates for this position,” D’Andrea wrote in an email to The Argus. “All three candidates possess a wealth of knowledge in the area of Title IX and Title VII, and are motivated to work with students in a higher education setting.” In their presentations, the candidates were tasked with offering training on Title VII and Title IX. In addition, candidates scrutinized potential areas of confusion between the two anti-discrimination laws, often offering fictional discrimination situations. Farias spoke on the importance of distinguishing between the two different laws. “Lots of people are experts in Title VII [and] you have less folks…[who] are experts in Title IX,” Farias said. “I need somebody who can cross both streams…. We’re…looking for a dynamic person that understands and has a full grasp of those laws and is able to function in the Wesleyan ecosphere—understanding that they’re not only going to be dealing with faculty; they’re going to be dealing with Wesleyan students, they’re going to be dealing with staff, and they’re going to be dealing with all three of those simultaneously at any given point.” D’Andrea furthered Farias’ point, exploring the capacity for each candidate to work with students. “[A]s director of CAPS, I am deeply invested in the selection of the person who will be interacting with students who come forward with Title IX and Title [VII] issues,” D’Andrea wrote in an email to The Argus. “[I]t is important to me that we select a candidate who is an expert in this area, and who possesses the sensitivity and interpersonal skills to effectively interact with students in the course of doing this very difficult work.” Civic Engagement Fellow Jelisa Adair ’13, who attended Houston’s open forum, commented on her unique perspective on the selection process. “Coming from being…a student and now becoming a staff member, I’m able to so much more clearly see the way we treat staff versus the way that we treat students,” Adair said. “I’ve had training like this before, but I never had training like this as a student…. It’s important that whoever we get in this position is able to relay this information to the student body, because I don’t think it has been done before in a good way.”"

		"title": "In Stitches: Pamela Roose Knits Close Community",
		"date": "2014-10-16",
		"authors": "by Jenny Davis, Haenah Kwon, Opinion Editor and Staff Writer",
		"content": "Pamela Roose, a knitting supplies store, brings the comfort of home to the Middletown community. Haenah Kwon, staff photographer Walking into Pamela Roose is like walking into a nest: the space is warm, soft, clean, and maternal. Yarn and sample knitted items are artfully displayed in wicker cradles and hanging on mannequins. Gentle music plays in the background. We sat down with founder and owner Pamela Steele on the Middletown store’s plush yellow chairs to chat. She explained that she derived the name of her store by combining her name and her husband Roosevelt’s. “He’s my not-so-silent partner,” she joked. Pamela Roose will celebrate its fourth birthday this November, but Steele is no newcomer to the knitting scene. She began participating in craft fairs in 2002, and in November 2010 she opened her first store in the Main Street Market. In July 2013, she moved to her spacious current location at 88 Court St. Steele’s experience with yarn extends to long before this business venture began: she has been knitting for 50 years. “My grandmother taught me,” she said. “We made these little crocheted skirts, and then she taught me to knit, and I made these baby items. Then I decided I wanted to follow a pattern, so I got a ‘how to knit’ book, and the first real thing I made from following a pattern was a baby set: a hat, the mitts, the sweater. From then on, it was just the way I went.” These days, Steele knits not only for family and friends, but also on commission. Lately, knit dresses have been occupying most of her time. “I just did one for my mother, for a cruise,” she said. “It was black with sequins in it, and it had baubles, and it was very detailed. I’m actually working on one now for a customer.” Of all the things she crafts, though, Steele is most moved by christening or baptism gowns for babies and children. “For me, it’s something very, very special,” she said. “I’ve made some for friends, for customers, but for me that’s something special, that they’re baptized or christened with a handmade item and not something from the store. It’s a labor of love for me, so that’s the thing I like the most, I’d say.” But for Steele, knitting is not simply a means to an end; she loves the process itself. “For me, it’s a great stress reliever,” she said. “It keeps me focused…. It’s creative…. You can take that ball of string, as some people say, and [then] at the end of it have something not only great but functional. I can’t sit still or sit in front of a TV or movie, without my hands moving.” Steele’s love for knitting has only grown with her recently acquired knowledge of knitting’s health benefits. “It keeps your mind active,” she said. “[It] lowers blood pressure. It’s not just a habit that people thought years ago was frivolous.” At a big oval table in the center of the store, Steele teaches knitting lessons. For her, it is a way to share her passion for counting stitches and casting. “I personally would rather teach someone to knit than to make something for them because they get past the initial learning curve, and when they sit down and really realize how relaxing it can be…they come back and say, ‘I love it!’” Steele said. “That’s what excites me because it is my passion. It’s nice to share it with someone else.” If she were forced to choose one type of yarn with which to knit for the rest of her life, Steele would be sure of her answer. “Cashmere!” she cried longingly, as though pining after a lost love. “Cashmere yarn is the ultimate luxury, and it’s one of the most expensive outside of opossum. It’s the softest, it’s luxurious, it doesn’t itch…it’s like wrapping yourself in—all I can say is luxury. Just luxury.” And what does Steele see as the future of her business? She’s enamored of Webs, a 20,000-square-foot yarn facility in Northampton, Mass., and dreams of one day operating a similar business. “My dream is to become the Webs of Connecticut,” she said. Time will tell whether or not Pamela Roose will expand, but for now, Steele is content to knit together a community in Middletown. “I want this to be a place where people can come and feel comfortable and warm and like they’ve met a friend,” she said. “I just want this to be like you’ve just walked into my home.” To that end, Pamela Roose has served as a haven for recent divorcees and stressed-out University students alike. “I have people who come in from court and say, ‘I just went through a divorce, and I saw your store,’ and they sit for a few minutes and de-stress from whatever,” she said. “It’s almost like being a bartender. You tell a bartender everything, and it’s kind of the same thing. I see a lot of students right after exams. Yes, it’s a business, but for me, it’s more than that. As my youngest says, ‘My mom collects people.’” Just as every knitted item in the shop has its own story of dropped stitches and countless start-overs, Steele sees every customer as a work in progress. “I always treat everyone who comes through the door with dignity and respect because we never know what their journey is,” she said. “If somebody’s having a bad day, feel free to come in and sit. I don’t bite.”"

		"title": "The Remote Vote: Absentee, But Not Absentminded",
		"date": "2014-10-23",
		"authors": "by Taylor Leet-Otley, Staff Writer",
		"content": "Presented with the choice of voting absentee in their hometowns or as Middletown residents, students cast their ballots where they count most.At the dawn of a fresh round of elections, many Wesleyan students are gearing up for the polls, as are hoards of college students across the country. According to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, college-educated young people were among the most well-represented in the 2012 elections. College students flocked to the polls en masse, favoring Barack Obama by a 23-point margin. However, polls by the Pew Research Center after the 2012 presidential election suggested that fewer young voters registered for that election than for the previous one in 2008, down 11 points from 66 to 55 percent. Many speculated that this was partially due to diminished enthusiasm compared to the 2008 campaign, while others pointed to a slew of controversial voter ID and early registration laws that had been implemented in many states in the months leading up to the 2012 election. Nevertheless, young people traditionally show a lower turnout than their older counterparts regardless of the election, and their overall numbers in non-presidential elections have historically been much lower than in presidential elections. With elections approaching on Nov. 4, political outlets are abuzz with information about upcoming congressional, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections, including 435 seats for the biannual House election, 36 Senate seats, including 3 up for special election; and 36 governors’ offices. Among these is the race between current Democratic Governor of Connecticut Dannel Malloy and the Republican nominee Tom Foley, who lost to Malloy by a narrow margin in the 2010 gubernatorial election. Malloy visited campus in early June to commemorate the opening of Wesleyan’s new auxiliary power micro-grid, which received state funding as part of an ongoing energy project in Connecticut. For those hoping to vote in the election, voting laws in Connecticut have become a focus of controversy in recent months. Connecticut voter laws are relatively strict compared to those in other New England states, forbidding absentee voting without an approved excuse. Veronica Birdsall ’15, a resident of Litchfield, Conn., is currently registered to vote with her home address. “Honestly, they don’t really follow up on whether your excuse is legit,” Birdsall said. “Honestly [I am registered in Litchfield] mostly because I had already registered there in high school and didn’t feel like going through the process of changing it.” Birdsall also spoke in support of a referendum on the ballot in the upcoming election to ease some of Connecticut’s early voting restrictions. “[It’s] not too bad since I had an excuse,” she said. “I couldn’t come home on Election Day due to lack of transportation…. But on the ballot is an Amendment to the Connecticut constitution to implement no-excuse absentee voting! So I voted for that.” Earl Lin ’15 of New Haven, Conn. is also registered to vote in his home district. “I’ve been registered at my home address in New Haven since I turned 18 and became eligible to vote,” he said. “Since it’s only about half an hour away and I wanted to continue voting in municipal primarily, mayoral, [and] aldermanic elections at home, it seemed most convenient and to make the most sense to keep my registration in New Haven.” However, in the past, he has chosen to vote absentee. “I did vote absentee for at least one election, but since one of the reasons for requesting an absentee ballot is that one is absent from town during an election, it was pretty straightforward to request a ballot,” Lin said. “I actually didn’t realize no-excuse voting was something some states do. I think it would be better if Connecticut offered early voting, though, as absentee ballots are sometimes not even counted unless the election is close. Regardless of its impact on the election, it’s nice to know that your vote has actually been counted.” In 2012, Connecticut legislators approved a law legalizing online voting in the state. The online voter registration form is run by the Office of the Secretary of the State, and voters can use the website to register anew, as well as register with a change of address. The site closed on Thursday, Oct. 22 and will remain closed until election day. For students coming from other states, however, there is also the consideration of whether to register in their home states or in Connecticut. Andreas Streuli ’15 has voted in his home state of California for previous elections. “I voted in 2012 out of state,” he said. “San Mateo County constantly sends me materials. I think I may be registered in Connecticut now because I keep getting called for jury duty.” Streuli listed among his reasons for voting out of state a feeling that his vote would go further in California, which receives 55 electoral votes in presidential elections compared with Connecticut’s 7. “I’m afraid my reason for registering to vote in California was just because it holds quite a bit more influence than Connecticut,” Streuli said. Matthew Conley ’15 of New York, another state that tends to vote consistently Democratic in elections, echoed Streuli’s sentiments. “I’m from New York, so I’m voting between two very blue states,” Conley said. “So where I register to vote in any given race depends on who has a more competitive congressional or senatorial race in a given cycle.” Conley also expressed interest in out-of-state voting due to differences in state politics. “I volunteered for a state Senate campaign the summer between my freshman and sophomore years,” he said. “Honestly, state legislature is where important decisions are made, and state legislature in New York is weird because it’s much more heavily Republican than the state as a whole in national elections.” For students considering voting in Connecticut who have yet to register, forms can still be returned in person at the Registrar’s office by Oct. 28. Additionally, vans will be running between Usdan and local polling centers on Nov. 4 for students voting in local elections."

		"title": "Who Wore it Wes: Monica Kornis ’15",
		"date": "2014-11-12",
		"authors": "by Gavriella Wolf, Staff Writer",
		"content": "Monica Kornis ’15 hails from Missouri but dresses for the future.Gavriella Wolf/Staff Writer By Gavriella Wolf Staff Writer   Monica Kornis ’15 has tailored her style over her years at Wesleyan, borrowing ideas from the past and future to inspire her own. Though she doesn’t quite dress like a “country girl,” Kornis is a Missouri native who praises her hometown as a haven for thrift shopping. The English major (who also touts a film minor) looked critically at her own sources of inspiration and shared them with The Argus.   The Argus: To what extent you consider yourself interested in fashion? Monica Kornis: I guess like as a mode of self-expression. I don’t, like, keep up with trends or anything; there’s people that inspire me that I see in movies, and pop culture, etc., but I don’t look up the latest trends or what was on the runway. I don’t keep track of any brands particularly.   A: How long have you been interested in the way you dress? MK: As long as I can remember, I guess. I think like, when you’re younger, you look at clothes, and they’re all fanciful and you’re like, “Oh, I want this, I want this, I want this,” and so that’s always kind of what happens.   A: Describe your personal style in three to five words. MK: I really like futuristic fashion, but I don’t really know if that’s my style. Things that are shiny, not things you would normally see. I guess I’m just attracted to shiny things. I like shiny things, I like leather. But I also like to be kind of minimalistic; I like wearing blacks, grays, whites. I don’t like my outfits being over-the-top. Okay, that’s three!   A: What do you like or dislike about style at Wesleyan? MK: I think people follow, like there are people [who are] really trendy at Wesleyan, which can be a good and bad thing. I guess being trendy is like having others dictate what you wear, but also it says that you care what you look like, which is nice. So there [are] pros and cons of each, but I think that’s one of the things.   A: How has your style changed, if at all, since you came to Wesleyan? MK: I think my style might be a little more mature, I guess, since I came to Wesleyan. Just because it comes with getting older. Like when I was first at Wesleyan, I wore a lot of floral stuff, I wore a lot of grandma sweaters. I think maybe I kind of found what I like, as opposed to when I came to Wesleyan, I’d just like wear anything that I found in the store that I thought was interesting. But now I try to match things more and piece outfits together more effectively.   A: Where are your favorite places to get your clothes? MK: I usually do all my shopping online. I go to like Etsy, eBay; when I go back home to Missouri I go to thrift stores and they’re amazing. It’s beautiful, because all these old women give away their clothes, and people in Missouri have a very different sense of fashion than they do here, so no one wants them. But then you can get things at thrift stores in Missouri for like, a dollar, and it’s amazing.   A: Who would design your dream wardrobe? MK: I guess I would like to design my dream wardrobe given that I had the appropriate skills, which I don’t. But I would like to design it myself and then have someone else implement that.   A: Where do you draw style inspiration from on campus? MK: Pretty much everyone I see. Like, if I see someone wearing something really interesting, then I’ll catalogue in my mind. I think everyone does that, they just catalogue things they see online and on campus, and it all meshes together, and that’s how people create their own personal styles. I think everyone kind of makes their own style; I just draw inspiration from everything and everyone I see.   A: Where do you draw style inspiration from off campus? MK: I draw inspiration from old film actresses from the silent era. I guess that’s kind of opposite of futuristic but a lot of them have dramatic makeup, and dark eyebrows, and wear black gowns, and I think that’s really interesting. And then, I think, Nico from the Velvet Underground, I think she has great style. And then Bjork is one of the people that isn’t afraid to do whatever she wants and wear crazy outfits, and I feel like that’s commendable.   A: What would you like to see more of in the fashion scene at Wesleyan? MK: I see people that create their own style but then again, they just like buy from Urban [Outfitters] and American Apparel, and I wish I’d see more people just like, break away from that, buy different things, and cultivate their style. I guess one of my pet peeves when it comes to fashion is you see something at an outfitters that really looks good on a mannequin, and people just buy a really similar outfit. Like, at least make something. I like it more when people have their own personal touch.   A: How do you think your style is going to change when you graduate and leave the Wesleyan bubble? MK: I guess it’d become more minimalistic. I think we’re in the stage where we can experiment and do whatever we want, and people won’t really judge us. But once we leave Wesleyan, I feel like we’re gonna be forced to conform more, because we’ll have jobs and won’t be able to wear crazy makeup or like, do our hair in the kind of ways we do it now. And so this is like a stage where we can experiment, and then we [will] have to conform, and then when I’m old, I’ll just like go wild. Because people don’t really care, [they] can be like, “Oh she’s senile, it doesn’t really matter.”"

		"title": "A Belated Holiday Gift to Alma Mater: A Set of New Year’s Resolutions",
		"date": "2015-01-25",
		"authors": "by Jason Shatz, Class of 2014",
		"content": "The year is young, and the semester brand new. From my armchair, I would like to propose a list of resolutions for the Wesleyan community. This is not meant to be exhaustive – I would be disappointed if additions were not presented. But here are five to start. 1. Commit to re-establishing trust on campus. The defining characteristic of 2014, both at Wesleyan and beyond, was turbulence. At Wesleyan, I observed a sad irony: the student body contains thoughtful young men and women who are eager expand their social and intellectual horizons – and yet it dangerously divided. Furthermore, students operate in a troubling zeitgeist, one filled with distrust. For example, many students do not trust the administration or Public Safety. The first thing that members of the Wesleyan community must do, therefore, is to commit to a new era where trust, transparency, and integrity are the norm. It needs to revitalize the Honor Code and the Code of Non-Academic Conduct. As a whole, this code needs to be revisited, updated, and put at the forefront of student life. 2. Improve campus safety The new Public Safety chief has been dealt a tough hand. A skeptical student body, a history of inappropriate officer behavior, a disturbing uptick in sexual violence – and that is just the tip of the iceberg. The department has started to enact overdue reforms to Wesleyan’s nightlife, including the enforcement of fire codes at concerts and in wood-frame houses. In order for the social scene to re-emerge, students must work with Public Safety and the administration to address the problems in campus safety. Most pressingly, the community must address the dangers that women face on campus – I want to add my appreciation for the hard work that students have done to illuminate them. Members of the community may disagree on the means, but they must share both the goal of improving campus safety for all – and mutual commitment of good faith toward that end. 3. Continue to fix Wesleyan’s fiscal woes. Since the Great Recession, Wesleyan has struggled to keep its endowment in decent shape, and the financial aid model had to be changed. Returning to the beloved model – 100% need blind for domestic applicants – would be nice, but Wesleyan should not do so if it is financially unsustainable. It needs to find a balance that provides the most possible assistance to needy students while not squeezing out the middle class. 4. Enrich the academic experience Wesleyan may be praised for its academics and the sheer breadth of intellectual thought that emanates from the community. But it does not adequately emphasize that set of core values that students deem essential – creativity, depth and breadth of critical thought, civic engagement, social justice. Some of these values are innate to the open curriculum, but others are not as prominent. I suggest codifying those values through new academic traditions. Firstly, core requirements rather than just general education expectations (or, for that matter, expectations that orientation spiels will stick for all four years). For example, consider a “diversity” requirement that asks students to take classes about different cultures. Whether through foreign-language classes or history classes – or many other types – there will be many ways to satisfy it. Secondly, expanding the “living and learning” program for freshmen (eventually for all freshmen, as Skidmore does). More educators would teach interdisciplinary courses with emphases on the aforementioned values, and students will live with peers who share at least one common interest – easing the transition to college and better facilitating the formation of lifelong friendships. Wesleyan also needs to better prepare students for the workplace. From revitalizing the Career Center to adding workshops for new apps and other important tools, Wesleyan needs to increase – in frequency and in quality – the scope of its efforts. In addition, Wesleyan should ensure that all students have ways to earn academic credit for internships. Employers would obviously love to have student interns, especially if they can compensate with academic credit instead of pay. Students, in turn, can remove a year from the four-year experience and save a year’s worth of money. 5. Revitalize Wesleyan’s social life. Only after Wesleyan ensures campus safety can Wesleyan’s social scene be truly revived. And it must re-emerge as son as possible, for a healthy social scene is crucial for the growth of all students. The shuttering of two fraternity houses, while justified, deprives Wesleyan of two large social spaces at a turbulent time. We need more spaces like those, especially in turbulent times like these. The only spaces that could possibly fit the student body are Foss Hill and the hockey rink. Working with Public Safety, students need to take advantage of existing facilities and create new, regulated environments for gatherings. Hopefully, more traditions will arise and unite the body of students now and to come."

		"title": "Students and Faculty Discuss Unpaid Internships at First Allbritton Talk",
		"date": "2015-02-02",
		"authors": "by Tess Morgan, News Editor",
		"content": "Civic Engagement Fellow Rosy Capron organized a series of discussions about public life, the first of which focused on unpaid internships.c/o Rosy Capron On Friday, Jan. 30, students and faculty gathered in the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life for the first in a series of discussions sponsored by the Center. Simply named “Allbritton Talks,” the series was created by Rosy Capron ’14, the University’s 2014-2015 Civic Engagement Fellow, and seeks to bring community members together for meaningful conversations about public life. The first talk focused on the rise and morality of unpaid internships. Capron explained the motivation that spurred the series’ creation. “Part of the inspiration was thinking about ‘What is public life?’” Capron said. “We have the Allbritton Center, which has classes and hosts speakers, but we haven’t had much of an opportunity to bring students into the fold, to ask them, ‘What does it mean to examine our public life? What does it mean to have a public life?’” One important aspect of the series is that it draws students and faculty from all walks of life to discuss common issues. Capron stated that in the discussions she hopes to recreate and build on the conversations students have with their friends. “I [created the series] thinking about really great conversations that I have with students and that I had when I was a student about political topics and current events,” Capron said. “It’s important to also have those conversations outside of your friend group with people who are less likely to agree with everything you say, to be confronted with difference and to grapple with these issues.” The topic of the first discussion, unpaid internships, was selected as a non-controversial way to begin the series, according to Capron. One attendee, Alicia Gansley ’15, expressed her satisfaction with the outcome of the discussion. “I thought it was a great chance to meet with staff members and students to talk about a really hot button issue for Wesleyan students and students across the country,” Gansley said. “Everyone was respectful and engaged, and I enjoyed it.” Despite never having had an unpaid internship, Gansley said that she still felt included in the discussion. “I feel like the topic [still applied to me], because as we talked about, for some people, including me, unpaid internships aren’t a reality or a choice that we have, so I’m [glad] I got to have a voice in the conversation, saying, ‘It’s just not the same for everyone,’” Gansley said. “I’m doing the Civic Engagement certificate so this is sort of right up my ally. I think it’s a great way to institutionalize the conversations we have in our dorms and around school.” Joli Holmes ’17, another attendee, stated that she enjoyed having a conversation about public life with like-minded students. “I enjoyed the experience because you don’t get to have these types of conversations in class,” Holmes said. “It’s an out-of-class experience where you’re still learning and discussing important and meaningful topics. I think a lot of students could benefit from this type of conversation.” Holmes described her experience at the first talk and her willingness to continue to engage in these types of conversations. “I would absolutely come to another talk,” Holmes said. “I think it depends on the subject matter, of course, but if they are structured like this I would come. It was a good size, too. It would be good to include more people, but at the same time it would be harder to have this type of conversation with a larger group.” Capron echoed these sentiments, stating her excitement for future discussions, which might be about more controversial topics. “I was happy to have students as well as staff and administrators there,” Capron said. “I’m curious to see how it will be with different sized groups and other topics. We started with [the topic of] unpaid internships because it’s of relevance to students but it isn’t necessarily divisive and intense and everyone can speak from their own experiences, but it will be interesting to hear the conversations [that arise] from more controversial topics. We definitely want [topics] that people will get excited about and be passionate about; we just don’t want to be exclusive. We’re going to be branching out and we would love to get people riled up as long as it’s a good atmosphere and it doesn’t get personal. Getting heated isn’t a bad thing.” The calendar for the talks is still undecided; however, Capron hopes they will become a weekly event. “The goal was to have these conversations weekly, and if students want to keep having them, we will,” Capron said. “It doesn’t take a lot of time or money to have people sit in a room and chat. We want to be flexible and respond to current events that come up. I hope people submit topics that are of interest to them so that we can [incorporate them] into our conversations.”"

		"title": "Carnegie Foundation Awards University 2015 Community Engagement Classification",
		"date": "2015-02-19",
		"authors": "by Kathy Yun, Staff Writer",
		"content": "c/o wesleyan.edu The Carnegie Foundation recently selected the University for its 2015 Community Engagement Classification. The award is for institutions that have demonstrated community engagement and founded on evidence-based documentation. The University was also selected for this recognition in 2008. According to the New England Resource Center for Higher Education, the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification considers community engagement a collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. “We did our initial application in 2008, and it’s an extensive process where they ask numbers such as how many learning classes we have, how many professors are engaged, how many students take these classes, specific examples of partnerships and how they have developed, outcomes, and how the community is involved in all of this,” said Director of Center for Community Partnerships Cathy Lechowicz. “This time around, they ask you what has changed since last time, and how you have further engaged with the community.” The projects and activities considered in this Classification involve not just the participation of students, administrators, and professors, but also the community members. According to Lechowicz, the community is Middletown-centric, but can also range from Connecticut to even larger areas. “The whole idea is that the engagement isn’t just about the University, but that it’s about working in the world and how to engage the world in the work that you’re doing,” Lechowicz said. “It’s a partnership where you work with agencies and individuals to try to address some public need or some public project.” The University has accomplished major achievements since its classification in 2010. These include institutional advances such as the establishment of the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, which both did not exist five years ago. Specific projects include the establishment of the Center for Prison Education and the growth of WesReads and WesMath—both of which started out with half a dozen students and currently have more than 70 students who go to the Macdonough School in Middletown on a regular basis. Director of Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship Makaela Kingsley shared her views on the importance of community engagement. “At the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, we believe that community engagement and collaboration are paramount to all social impact work,” Kingsley said. “In fact, innovation or ‘charity’ alone—without cultural competence and involvement by relevant communities—can be destructive. Wesleyan students are better entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs because our students and faculty are highly engaged citizens.” Lechowicz added that the challenge of the institution is helping students to develop these projects and provide them that autonomy that many of the students want, while also providing institutional support for them in a way they can further their project. Another example of the University’s community engagement is the Green Street Teaching and Learning Center, a community-based studio that engages different members of the Middletown community such as students and faculty, local artists, and faculty from Middletown Community College. Most of the classes offered a combination of math and science with art and are taught to students of grades 1-8. Director of the Service-Learning Center Barbara Juhasz commented on the role of this organization. “Green Street is a wonderful example of community partnership that functions in so many different ways that involves students on a regular basis, involves faculty in service-learning courses, and provides a great mechanism for students to be more involved in the community,” Juhasz said. Anna Flurry ’17, student coordinator for Green Street Teaching and Learning Center, commented on what the organization has to offer in terms of community engagement. “Green Street offers this great opportunity for Wesleyan students to get out of the college bubble and interact with the Middletown community in a positive way,” Flurry said. “I think it’s really important to be aware that we’re part of a much bigger community called Middletown. We’ve been able to create many connections with the town around us, which has enabled us to get rid of the idea of otherness. I personally feel like I have a much stronger connection to Middletown.” Through this partnership, the Carnegie Foundation provides classified institutions with feedback on general themes throughout the application process such as insight in areas they can focus on and develop. Lechowicz praised the helpfulness of this process. “We talk with other schools and work with other people, but you certainly have your blinders on in a sense, Lechowics said. “It’s nice to get feedback from outside folks and the framework for engagement they provide.” The next opportunity to apply for Classification will be 10 years from now. This is an extension of the prior five years due to existing partnership, which shows the plan for the long-term relationship the Foundation and the University will have. For information on how to get involved, engagement work on campus, and community events, students can sign up for the ENGAGED newsletter or the Civic Engagement Fellow newsletter."

		"content": "On April 22 and May 5, Scholars in Action, a student group that tutors students at local middle schools, will be hosting its first ever Wesleyan Enrichment Days.Scholars in Action, a student group that tutors students at local middle schools, will be hosting its first ever Wesleyan Enrichment Days. The Enrichment Days, on Wednesday, April 22 and Tuesday, May 5, will take place on Foss Hill and offer a number of workshops to students from schools such as Keigwin Middle School and Woodrow Wilson Middle School. Event organizers, Lily Wittrock ’16 and Rebecca Brand ’16, are currently looking for individuals and groups on campus who would be interested in leading workshops on a variety of different topics. “These Enrichment Days are something we have been planning on doing with our kids [since] this group’s inception,” Wittrock and Brand wrote in an email to The Argus. “We go to Keigwin and Woodrow Wilson every week during their after school program to help with homework, and their enrichment activities (yoga, cooking, video game design, swimming, poetry). We are inviting the students to [the University] as an extension of the work we do with them every week creating a fun, educational environment.” The two hope to help bridge the gap between the University and the Middletown community through Enrichment Day workshops. Potential topics include drawing, dance, science, and creative writing. In addition to these workshops, the days will include a campus tour and other activities. “We are planning on starting with a big icebreaker outside, then taking tours around campus with [University] students,” Wittrock and Brand wrote. “After that, we will break out into smaller groups to participate in activities led by…student groups.” According to the University’s ENGAGE blog, the workshops are expected to include 5 to 15 students for an engaging 40 minutes. “If you are interested in education or just feel like frolicking on Foss with some hilarious preteens, then this may be the low-commitment opportunity for you,” the blog reads. The organizers are hoping to work with different program houses, as well as student groups, to ensure that the days will allow the middle school students a glimpse of college life. In addition, the organizers wish to motivate students to attend colleges while also providing time for them to socialize with University students outside the classroom. Rosy Capron ’14, a Civic Engagement Fellow at the University’s Center for Community Partnerships, has assisted in getting the project underway. “Middle schoolers don’t know very much about what people study and do for fun in college, especially at a liberal arts college,” Capron said. “They take ‘Language Arts,’ ‘Social Studies,’ and ‘Science,’ not ‘Chinese Poetry,’ ‘Latin American History,’ or ‘Conservation Biology.’ The enrichment days are a great way for them to learn about the academic and extracurricular activities that make college worthwhile.” She added that this event is the first of its kind in recent years. “Students from the Middletown area come to campus for High School Humanities and programs in the Davison Arts Center, Van Vleck Observatory, and Mansfield Freeman Center, but I don’t believe we’ve tried anything very similar to the Enrichment Days in recent years,” Capron said. The feedback from the student body has so far been positive. Scholars in Action have been working alongside the Office of Community Service to ensure that the day is possible. “There are a lot of other groups that tutor in Middletown schools during the day but ours is the first specifically working with an established, structured after-school program for middle schoolers,” wrote Wittrock and Brand."

		"title": "Haffner ’76 Reflects on Life as a “Sexologist Minister”",
		"date": "2015-04-23",
		"authors": "by Hyunji Ward, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "Debra Haffner ’76 returned to the University on Wednesday, April 22, to deliver a lecture entitled, “Lessons from a Life in Sex and Ministry,” sponsored by The Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. As an undergraduate, Haffner was co-founder of the University’s first Women’s Center, and went on to hold leadership roles at Planned Parenthood, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SEICUS), and other not-for-profit organizations. Most recently she founded The Religious Institute, a multi-faith organization advocating for justice, sexual health, and education in faith communities and society at large. Now, she describes herself as a “Sexologist Minister.” Haffner began by describing her time at the University and the impact her undergraduate education had on her career. “Wesleyan launched my career in many ways… but not in the ways that I had expected,” Haffner said. “I came to campus in the fall of 1972. I was the second class of women who came in as freshmen, and I think that’s pretty hard to imagine today…. Women like me were still coming to college with the parental message that we were here to find a career that we could fall back on if our husbands died or left us.” Haffner noted that abortion was still illegal in Connecticut. Reflecting on her own experiences, and those of other female students, in terms of sexual misconduct, she emphasized the absence of terms or concepts like “date rape” or “sexual harassment.” “My sophomore year I took a women’s studies class,” Haffner said. “This course just exploded my world. All of a sudden, I was able to make sense of all those conflicting messages and was able to own who I was.” Haffner cites this class as the beginning of her career as a sex educator. She partnered with a fellow student, was given a $500 budget by the University, and founded the Wesleyan Women’s Center. “We struck for a gynecologist…this old guy who didn’t know how to do pelvic [exams], was not okay with us,” Haffner said. “We organized consciousness-raising groups, which were groups of women, but [also] co-ed, so women and men could talk about the impact of sexism growing up. We brought people to campus to teach women how to do plumbing and car repair.” After attending a women’s workshop organized by Our Bodies, Ourselves—in which the female workshop facilitator got up on a table, inserted a speculum into her vagina, and offered workshop attendees a flashlight with which to examine her cervix—Haffner and her colleague began hosting the same workshop every other week in Exley Science Center. Switching from a pre-law path to sexual education, Haffner quit her job and took a position at the Population Institute. She urged students to take their first job based on the organization itself, not on the position originally offered to them. “At the Population Institute… I would come in early and stay late… I started creating fact sheets for them, and I started to do extra research. I would put memos on their desk of interesting things I thought they needed to know when they came in in the morning.” She was promoted at the Public Health Service, after being the only employee still in the office after 5 p.m. At 23 years old, Haffner was given a $14,000,000 national program to set up adolescent health centers around the country. Once Haffner became the Executive Director of SEICUS, she organized health and sexuality organizations around the country in the production of the “Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education,” which are still widely used today. Haffner is also the author of seven books; her first one, “From Diapers to Dating,” continues to be the most successful. She commented on the importance of collaboration in any field. “We are smarter together than we are alone,” Haffner said. “No matter how good you are, how smart you are, how passionate you are, you don’t know everything, and other people can help you think. That’s really been a lesson that I’ve learned over and over again.” Haffner then described the most recent “turn” her life has taken, which began during a talk she was asked to give at her home congregation on sexuality and religion. “In the middle of that talk, I felt a call… this message of ‘this is what you’re supposed to do,’” said Haffner. “I’m from a Jewish background and am a Unitarian Universalist—we don’t get calls from anybody… this was not part of my experience at all.” She pointed to a quote from Frederick Buechner, a Presbyterian minister, to describe her understanding of “call” as the place “where the world’s greatest need meets your greatest joy.” “I’ve often thought, ‘Why didn’t I go into gun control?’ ‘Why didn’t I go into anti-racism?’” Haffner said. “Frankly, I’m always amazed that sexuality issues are the front page issues of political life… as important as I think those things are, I don’t think they’re the most important issues facing America, [but] they’re my issues. When I heard this line, I thought, ‘That’s what it is,’ finding that intersection between what I’m passionate about and what the world needs.” She concluded with some lessons for not-for-profit management, emphasizing the importance of maintaining relationships and asking for help when it’s needed. She also cited proficiency in finances as one of her most important skills, specifically the ability to read an audit or put a budget together. In terms of hiring, she advised students never to offer a position to someone they couldn’t imagine seeing every day. “One of the things I do often now, is take people out for meals before I hire them, and watch how they treat the wait staff,” Haffner said. “If I don’t like the way you treat the wait staff, I don’t want you working for me, because eventually you’re going to treat one of our customers like that, or one of our stakeholders, or me, like that.” Haffner referred back to her belief in working beyond the parameters of the traditional workday. “I have always worked harder than anyone who’s worked for me,” Haffner said. “I am always the first person in the office, and I’m still the last person to leave. I’ve been doing that now for close to 40 years. In order to get the best from people, I think that they need to see that I am full in.” Finally, she expressed the belief in staying involved programmatically, doing direct community outreach, and staying current. Haffner noted that after leaving SEICUS, she assumed she was finished having adventures, but that she realized life is constantly evolving. She described some of her most exciting moments since ministry, including marrying her two close friends after their 50-year relationship when gay marriage finally became legal in New York. “I’ve been to the Easter Prayer Breakfast at the White House,” said Haffner. “I’ve debated Bill O’Reilly several times on television, I did the blessing at Jane Fonda’s 70th birthday—that’s Rosie O’Donnell behind her, and Sally Field, and Lily Tomlin, and me—I got to hang out with these people. This picture is from a transgender day of remembrance… I was invited by the Peace Council to come to a meeting in Thailand with them, to talk about women and religion.” Civic Engagement Fellow Rosy Capron ’14 reacted to Haffner’s talk as an alumna. “It’s helpful to hear from someone who clearly enjoys the work that they do, and who has not only had a satisfying career, but also a really satisfying life,” Capron said. “Not necessarily an easy career or an easy life, but [she’s] always learning and reflecting.” Joanna Paul ’18 reflected on a more personal level. “I’m a Unitarian Universalist [UU] myself, so it was really cool for me to hear a fellow UU who actually went here, because I’m really interested in social justice,” Paul said. “Everything she said really speaks to me. I think the issues she focused on are really important. I liked the point about taking people out to dinner before hiring them… I thought that was really interesting.” Haffner’s final remarks were a testament to her experience at the University. “I’m grateful to Wesleyan for what it gave me and what I learned here,” Haffner said. “It was that girl with the speculum that’s still teaching pretty much the same thing, which is that our sexuality is a wonderful part of life, that we need education and information, and that we can bring our passion to make our world a better place for people.”"

		"authors": "by Amelia Spittal, Staff Writer",
		"content": "On May 2, the Broccoli City Organic Lifestyle Group sponsored the Broccoli City Forum at the University to discuss sustainability.The Broccoli City Organic Lifestyle Group sponsored the Broccoli City Forum at the University on Saturday, May 2. Juliana Manrique ’15, Kate Weiner ’15, and Rina Kremer ’15 were joined on the panel by Director of the Office of Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias and Director of Feet to the Fire Erin Roos-Brown. The event took place in the Bessie Schonberg Dance Studio and featured artwork on display as well as a projected slideshow of different pictures from this year’s Broccoli City Festival. Kimora Brock ’15 and Kafilah Muhammad ’18 facilitated a discussion focused on sustainability and the importance of uniting environmental causes with social projects. The discussion emphasized the speakers’ advice and insight, based on their personal experiences with similar projects. Farias discussed his interest in environmental issues and their effect on communities. These interests stemmed from his own experiences growing up in the Bronx. “I’ve been here for about a year and a half, and what I see is that we need to reconnect some of these questions of environmentalism and sustainability with ones of diversity and inclusion and equity,” Farias said. “I grew up in the Bronx, and I had asthma. And I had this question of…why do I have asthma…. And if you know anything about the environment and how it impacts underdeveloped communities… You can use the term environmental racism.” He added that it took him a while to understand this term. “When I went off and joined the army, we were in Jordan, and for some reason I went from…walking around with an inhaler, to all of a sudden being able to breathe,” Farias said. “It took me years to understand that it was the environment, the pollutants that were in my city.” Campus & Community Engagement Manager Erin Roos-Brown manages Feet to the Fire, a program at the University dedicated to examining environmental issues through multiple lenses. She spoke about her past experiences and mistakes working in sustainability and what she learned from them. “About two years ago, it…seemed like what we were doing in Feet to the Fire wasn’t all that effective,” Roos-Brown said. “The students…were doing a lot of great, creative things, and that seemed to be what people were more interested in…. So that’s when we decided we were going to start transitioning Feet to the Fire to be a lot more about supporting student projects and really engaging students in their own place. What we learned from this is that when you think you’ve got your project just right, it probably needs to change. There’s something you need to tweak, something you need to do. If it is going to survive, it has to evolve.” When asked what makes a project a success, Kremer—a member of the sustainability group WILD Wes and the Local Foods Co-op—said that the ability to compromise is a necessity when you are working on forming a new group on campus. “Communication and an openness to go in a different direction than first intended [are important],” Kremer said. “You can’t make enemies with the University. While they might not be as lenient or think the same way that you do about your project, you will be able to gain ground with them when you make compromises and work with them.” Manrique, who runs the Wesleyan Students for Sustainable Fashion group, said that another important aspect of creating a successful project is perseverance. “I would say that you definitely need determination,” Manrique said. “You need…to get support from the University, from students, and then on top of that, you need funding. You apply for grants and you’ll be turned down numerous times, but you have to persevere and keep your goal in mind. If it’s something that you really want to expand, that you’re really passionate about, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t really see it through.” In closing, the panelists were asked what advice they would give to students looking to get involved with one of the many environmentalist and sustainability groups on campus. “Just join,” Kremer said. “We have so many student groups on campus trying to get their projects off the ground or trying to sustain themselves, and they’re really looking for anyone…who’s willing and wanting to get involved…. Even if you know nothing about the environment and what the group really does, just go to a meeting. They’ll welcome you.”"

		"title": "Princeton Review Ranks University #1 Impact School",
		"date": "2015-09-07",
		"authors": "by Natasha Nurjadin, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "University tops Princeton Review's Best Schools for Making an Impact, with most on-campus student engagement and community service opportunities.The University has been ranked #1 on Princeton Review’s list of “Best Schools for Making an Impact” this year, a new category of college rankings published in the Review’s “Colleges That Pay You Back: The 200 Best Value Colleges and What It Takes to Get In (College Admissions Guides).” According to the Princeton Review, the list of “Best Schools for Making an Impact” are schools that feature the best community service opportunities, student governments, sustainability, and on-campus student engagement. They are also schools with the highest reported percentage of alumni with high job meaning. “Students say that the ‘open and engaging student culture’ is the University’s greatest strength: Students are ‘at the heart of global issues’ thanks to the ‘vibrant student culture and activism,’” the Princeton Review website reads. “The Connecticut school is known for its community service and commitment, headlined by the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship.” The Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship (PCSE) is a campus resource that encourages and supports students and alumni who are interested in social entrepreneurial ventures, including creating and sustaining programs, businesses, and organizations. They hold programs to help develop student programs and also offer grants for students who are interested in developing new programs. Lily Herman ’16 is the founder of The Prospect, a website utilized by high school students to help through the college process. Today, it has around 600,000 users. “It’s awesome that Wesleyan is on the list for being an impact school,” Herman said. “There’s been a lot of work done in recent years by the Center for Community Partnerships, the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and other departments to ensure that students are getting a thoughtful and well-rounded education on what civic engagement is really about.” Makaela Kingsley, director of PCSE, wrote in an email to The Argus that she believes social impact has always been a core component of the University culture and philosophy. “I don’t think [this list] says anything about our community that we didn’t already know,” Kingsley wrote. “I’ve joked that this ranking just means the secret is out, that the world is starting to recognize what we witness every day: students and alumni who are passionate about social change, with an academic and extra-curricular education that uniquely prepares them to have impact.” Kingsley believes that the ranking reflects how passionate the students at the University are about being change-makers tackling social issues. “Today, ‘practical idealism’ continues to characterize a Wesleyan education,” Kingsley wrote. “We attract students, faculty, and staff who think critically, draw important connections between disciplines, and seek ways to contribute to the common good.” With this ranking, Kingsley has high hopes for the development of PCSE and that students take advantage of these resources to continue making an impact. “I hope prospective students choose to come to Wesleyan not just for our academic reputation, but also because we are a premier school for social entrepreneurs and changemakers,” Kingsley wrote. The Patricelli Center will continue to hold and introduce new social impact programs, including the Wesleyan Social Impact Summit, a program that will bring together students and alumni to discuss and share resources on what they are passionate about during the weekend of Nov. 13-14. The event will feature panelists including prominent Wesleyan alumni, small group programs to facilitate discussion, and networking opportunities for students and alumni alike. “A lot of the social impact programs on campus are on the newer side, so I’m really excited to see how those continue to grow and develop in the coming years,” Herman said. Caroline Liu ’18, the intern for the Social Impact Summit, said that the ranking reflects the image of the University of one that promotes social change. “I’m not surprised that Wesleyan is number one [on the list],” Liu said. “But I don’t think it’s a reason to pat ourselves on the back or feel that we’re finished with our work. I think that we received this title because we always had a culture of caring about making change, and it’s not like this title should make us feel that we’ve achieved our goal.”"

		"title": "The Argus Welcomes New Tenure-Track Faculty",
		"date": "2015-09-07",
		"authors": "by Jenny Davis, Features Editor",
		"content": "New tenure-track faculty dish on their journeys to Wes, the projects that excite them, and what they do when they're not teaching.This fall, the University welcomed a broad array of new tenure-track faculty members. The Argus discussed with these professors the paths that took them to Wesleyan, their current projects, and their lives outside the classroom.   Francesco Marco Aresu, Assistant Professor of Italian The Argus: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? Marco Aresu: I work on medieval and early-modern literature: Influential personalities in my field very rarely make it to the news. I prefer to mention “heroes” at the intersection between academia and civil society. Next year is the anniversary of the 1966 flood of the Arno in Florence. Volunteers from around the world (the so-called Mud Angels) convened to Florence to clean the city from the mud, to retrieve books and work of arts from flooded rooms, and to rescue the traces of the past for the spiritual growth of future generations. Very peculiar heroes, indeed.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? MA: With a former colleague from Harvard University I am working on a recently re-discovered manuscript of Leon Battista Alberti, an Italian humanist of the 15th century. I am also working on my first book, which studies how different media (manuscripts, prints, kindle, etc.) affect the composition, circulation, and reception of the literary texts that they transmit.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Any special talents or hobbies? MA: I like to learn languages (I am in the process of picking the ninth language I will study). I work out every day. And I love me some good red wine. Not necessarily in this order.   Joseph Coolon, Assistant Professor of Biology The Argus: What’s the most important thing for you about working with students? Joseph Coolon: I really enjoy seeing the moment when things click for people. One of the things that’s really important to me is reaching students who may have never considered the subject that I’m teaching something that they might care about, or need to know, or be interested in.   A: What’s one project or idea that you’re really excited about? JC: The research in my lab is generally focused on looking at how the DNA that different species contain allows different species to be different. Specifically, the work is looking at how changes in DNA influence these differences between species, not in terms of what products are being made by those genes, but by how those genes are turned on and turned off, and when, where, and how much of them are being made.   A: What do you enjoy outside the classroom? JC: I quite enjoy running. I quite enjoy fishing. I like bike riding as well. So I guess a lot of more active outdoor sports.   Candice Etson, Assistant Professor of Physics The Argus: What’s the most crucial part of teaching for you? Candice Eston: There have been people who have taken time out of their lives to do something small that really made a big difference to me. It’s really critical in fields like science, where there are so many different paths, and it’s not always clear how you get from one place to another, that people take the time to tell you what your opportunities are. People really did that for me, and it made me want to give that back. And then in my own field, there are not a lot women or minorities, so I feel really lucky to have had the opportunities I had. I’d really like to be a part of letting those opportunities be available to more people….When you have people with different perspectives, who come from different places and different backgrounds, everything is better. It’s so much more interesting, you get such better work done, and amazing things can happen. I also just love teaching. I think the stuff I do is really cool, so I like to let other people know about that.   A: What is one research project or idea that you’re really excited about right now? CE: I’m really excited about a project that I’m just now getting going. There are two major projects I’m working on. One is in the lab, and then I have this education research project I’m doing, which I’m actually not going to tell you too much about, because Wesleyan students are going to be the research subjects. I’m really excited to be doing science education research to try to find out how the way people think and do problem-solving is important for science education, and the goal of that is to make the way we teach physics better. I’m excited about that. Everyone at Wesleyan is really into it, and that’s been great.   A: You were a ballet dancer and you’re an artist. What connections have you found between science and art? CE: In ballet, there’s this sort of approach, like a mindset, that you never really feel that anything you do is finished or perfect, so you just keep working on it. When you learn to be a ballet dancer, the first things you learn are pliés and tendus, and until the day you stop doing ballet, you will do pliés and tendus, and you will always try to make them better. And so that kind of approach, and that mindset, and that discipline, has always served me really well—that idea that you can always find something new, even in something really simple that you learned as a kid.   Anthony Hatch, Assistant Professor of Science in Society  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan?  Anthony Hatch: Wesleyan’s intellectual culture and commitment to liberal education as reflected in its faculty and students were the biggest draws for me. I am especially excited about being a member of the truly interdisciplinary Science in Society Program. There are very few programs like it in the country that draw on so many diverse fields of inquiry.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching?  AH: I love the ways in which teaching is a special kind of performance art. I very much consider my time with my students in the classroom as an intimate and personal show. Like the best artists, I aim to bring high energy and serious preparation to every single class and hope that illumination and new understandings emerge for myself and my students.   A: What’s one project or idea you’re excited about right now?  AH: I’m most excited about my new book titled “Blood Sugar: Racial Pharmacology and Food Justice in Black America” that will be published this winter with the University of Minnesota Press. In this book, I analyze and challenge the ways in which “metabolic syndrome” has emerged as a major biomedical category that medical researchers have created to better understand the health risks of high blood sugar, blood pressure, body fat, and cholesterol. I argue that the metabolic syndrome also represents another, very real crisis: Its advent signals a new form of “colorblind scientific racism” that repackages race within biomedical and genomic research.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Talents or hobbies?  AH: I most enjoy traveling, reading, and laughing with my sweet family. I also enjoy early morning jogging—something I never thought I would say! At one point in a past life, I could make a fair claim to be a triple threat in the performing arts: I could dance, sing, and play a musical instrument (the violin). I’m way too rusty to call them “talents” or “hobbies” but I could probably complete a decent grande jete if you put me on the spot.   Jeffrey Naecker, Assistant Professor of Economics  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Jeff Naecker: The entire Economics Department at Wesleyan is incredibly impressive: producing well-published research while also teaching rigorous classes to extremely intellectual students. I’m honored to have a chance to work with everyone here. Wesleyan also reminds me a lot of my undergraduate time at Berkeley: smart, athletic, and socially engaged students on a purposefully inclusive and active campus.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? JN: Teaching is one of the most value-creating things we can do as human beings. It involves organizing a potentially very large set of knowledge into a form that students can digest, re-interpret, and ultimately pass on to others. That creation and transmission of information is exhilarating and rewarding.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? JN: Here’s a little mental experiment: Suppose I give you $10 and tell you that you can split it however you choose between two poor households in Kenya that I’ve identified. After you tell me how you’d like to allocate the money, I’ll flip a coin. If it’s heads, I’ll allocate as you asked. But if it’s tails, I’ll allocate  differently: all $10 to household A and none to household B.  So, how would you like to split the money? Here’s the twist: Suppose that I’ve flipped the coin and I double-check your allocation with you before implementing it.  Do you want to change your allocation? In a paper I’m writing right now with several co-authors, we show in a series of experiments that many people choose $0 to A and $10 to B initially — they are offsetting the default allocation.  But after the coin flip, they want to switch to to an equal split: $5 each.  It turns out this behavior is hard to explain with standard economic theories. Put another way, we as economists are still learning about how people define fairness, and how the definition depends on the context and the timing of the decision.   Paula Park, Assistant Professor of Spanish  The Argus: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? Paula Park: Basing this question on my current research, I would say that four major heroes in my field are José Rizal, José Martí, Eugenio María de Hostos and Lola Rodríguez de Tió. They were all compromised intellectuals and proponents of the independence of their homelands (Philippines, Cuba and Puerto Rico), as well as active seekers of transnational unity against colonial powers.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? PP: When I look back at the courses I have taught in the past years in three universities, stories of all kinds come to mind. But ultimately the most rewarding memory is simple and yet abstract: having provided students with the opportunity to confront something new. My goal in the classroom is to enable students to discover new interests of their own through the study of Spanish language and Hispanic culture. Also, for me, human interaction is at the core of teaching and learning, so I really enjoy seeing my students collaborating with each other for assignments in class or even outside of class.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? PP: Right now am excited about two projects. On the one hand I look forward to being able to work on my first book project, which examines the influences of writers from Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines after 1898, that is, right after they ceased to be connected through the logic of the Spanish empire and became subject to US expansionism. On the other hand, I am also excited about a more personal academic project. Born to Korean immigrants in Chile, I am interested in the cultural productions of diverse Asian diasporas throughout Latin America and the Hispanic Caribbean. I will offer a course that will cover this topic in the spring semester.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Any special talents or hobbies? PP: I like hiking or simply walking around cities, especially if it’s in good company. Since I’ve moved to Connecticut, I’ve enjoyed exploring Hartford. At home, I’m enjoying playing the piano again.   Michelle Personick, Assistant Professor of Chemistry The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Michelle Personick: I’ve known that I wanted to teach at a small liberal arts college as long as I’ve known I wanted to be a professor. I went to a NESCAC school (Middlebury) myself as an undergrad and I think the small liberal arts college is a fantastic model for undergraduate education because it provides opportunities for faculty and students to actually get to know each other and for faculty to be able to take an active interest in students’ success. As a graduate student at a research university, I was responsible for a lecture with 350 students, and at that point it’s hard to reach out to individual students who might be struggling, unless they take the initiative and come to office hours. Wesleyan was a particularly special opportunity for me as a scientist because of the strong research programs here at Wes. Having a small, but talented, group of graduate students in chemistry increases the quality and variety of scientific resources available to all students on campus, and means that I’m able to introduce undergrads to my area of research—metal nanomaterials—which is something I wouldn’t be able to do at a lot of other liberal arts schools.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? MP: My biggest influences have generally been the people who have directly mentored me: a graduate student a year ahead of me in grad school, as well as my undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral advisors. It may not seem as exciting as the big “heroes” of the field, but those were the people I saw every day, doing science and being leaders in their areas. Those are the people you watch and think, “How do they do that?”—whether they’re conducting experiments, or coming up with ideas, or giving presentations. And then a younger scientist comes up to you sometime later and says the same thing to you, and you realize those people have been teaching you how all along.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? MP: One big exciting project for me right now is setting up my research lab and starting to do experiments. I have a brand new space that I’ve been stocking with shiny new glassware and supplies over the summer with help from a couple of research students. The lab has begun to be operational in the last few weeks and we’ve done some initial experiments, which is great. This fall we’ll be building a new piece of equipment and we’ll have some new students joining the research group so I’m excited to see where things are a few months from now.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom or lab? Any special talents or hobbies? MP: Before I came to Wesleyan, I was living in the Boston area and I trained and competed with a masters women’s rowing team. I loved being on the Charles River early in the morning and enjoyed getting to know a lot of awesome women who came from a wide range of backgrounds. I miss it, and I’m hoping to get out on the Connecticut River in the not-too-distant future.   Felipe Ramírez, Assistant Professor of Math  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Felipe Ramírez: It’s a great university and math department. Also, I like that both research and teaching are emphasized equally here. At many other places the faculty are expected to concentrate on one more than the other. But research and teaching are both important aspects of my life, and I wouldn’t want to give either one up in favor of the other.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? FR: I truly enjoy meeting my students, interacting with them, etc. But my answer for this one was a bit more selfish: By teaching, I improve my own understanding of the material. Students often ask questions that I’ve never considered before, and this forces me to think about old ideas in new ways. I enjoy the challenge of seeking explanations from these new points-of-view, and the feeling of discovery when I find them. Also, it is very common for some random piece of a course to make it’s way into my research, often when the two seem totally unrelated. Sometimes I’ll be stuck on something for days, only to discover a solution waiting for me in my own lecture notes.   A: What’s a project you’re excited about right now? FR: Lately (meaning the last couple of years) I’ve been interested in a field of mathematics called Diophantine approximation, where we try to quantify how closely irrational numbers (non-fractions) can be approximated by rational numbers (fractions). As simple as it sounds, there are still many open, profound, beautiful problems in this area, and even some that have potential “real-world” applications. Even better, there are many deep connections between Diophantine approximation and my main line of research: ergodic theory and dynamical systems, where we study the long-term behavior of systems that change in time. I find these problems and their connections to dynamics fascinating.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? FR: I have always loved music. I taught guitar throughout my undergraduate years, and nowadays I play mostly for my daughter, who is one year old and doesn’t let me get through two bars before she’s swatting and banging at the strings. I also love puzzles, especially crosswords. I rarely skip a day. (NYT almost exclusively, though I did take up the Guardian’s cryptics during the five years I lived in England.) I also read, watch movies, etc. Mostly, though, my free time is spent with my wife and daughter. We’re new to Connecticut, so we have a lot to discover!   Ying Jia Tan, Assistant Professor of History  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? YJT: I have always wanted to teach at a liberal arts college with a vibrant and diverse student population, which allows me to develop as a scholar and teacher. There are many programs for civic engagement with local communities and the broader region, which allows the students to see the connection between what they learn in the classroom and the world around them.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? YJT: I certainly refrain from worshipping heroes in my academic field. As a historian of science, I believe that the pursuit of knowledge is not the result of the work of a single genius, but the collective endeavor of all levels of society. Take the light bulb for example. It is too simplistic to say that it was invented by Thomas Edison. Rather, the development of manufacturing systems, the financing that supported the growth of power-generation and delivery systems, and growing perception of the safety of electric light all contributed to the popularization of the light bulb. As a scholar of Chinese history, I am deeply motivated by the educational philosophy of a twelfth-century Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi (1130-1200). Many of his conversations with his students revolve around the meaning of education. He advocated the idea of “Greater Learning,” through which students should be instructed in the extension of knowledge, understand the principles of nature, and learn the basic values of loyalty and filial piety.   A: What’s one project that you’re excited about right now? YJT: I am excited about my book project about the history of electricity in wartime China. My work looks at the East Asian energy crisis, which started with the outbreak of the second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and never really ended. I examine how the Guomindang and Communist regimes dealt with power shortages. The formative years of China’s energy industry overlapped with the years of war, which forced the Guomindang and the Communists to integrate the energy sector with national security interest. This project allows us to understand what the term “energy security” means in China today.   Shellae Versey, Assistant Professor of Psychology    The Argus: Who are some of your heroes or major influences in your field? Shellae Versey: That’s a difficult one! It’s hard to narrow it down, because there are so many people I admire, who are pushing the traditional boundaries of psychology in order to move the field forward. But I think if I had to name heroes, I’d say Kenneth and Mamie Clark’s work initially drew me to study psychology, initially as a graduate student, because their work still impacts social psychology and other fields as well. And then I’m also deeply influenced by the work of Patricia Hill-Collins, Kimberle’ Crenshaw, and bell hooks, who engage in difficult dialogues around issues of gender, race, identity, and engagement in a purposeful way.   A: What’s your favorite thing about working with students? SV: I actually get really excited working with students. I think that, especially in a small, seminar-style class, you get the opportunity to interact with and get to know students, how they’re thinking and processing the material. I often get asked very real and practical, useful questions, either about the content that we’re covering or about my own research, that I’ve not considered before or thought about through a particular lens. It’s refreshing to have that experience in the classroom, where everyone feels that they’re fulfilled and part of the learning experience, myself included.   A: What is one project or idea that you’re really excited about right now? SV: A new project I’m excited about starting is exploring neighborhood social engagement among different age groups. One of the areas I study is aging. I’m always interested in the question of how older adults remain socially engaged as they get older, and what factors facilitate either engagement or withdrawal and isolation, and ultimately [I hope to] have a sense of how being socially engaged—or lack thereof—correlates with mental health.   A: What do you enjoy outside the classroom? What are your passions, talents, or hobbies? SV: I don’t have any special talents! But I do enjoy reading for leisure, which is harder than I thought it would be—just to pick up a book and read it. So when I get time I like to read, I like to exercise, and I like to scrapbook and do photography, which might be a little different. I enjoy anything in general that’s off the beaten path. I like to be outdoors and just enjoy life. I’m trying to live in the moment and embrace the spirit of mindfulness, which I think as a society we’re engaging in as a collective conversation.   Yamil Velez, Assistant Professor of Government  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Yamil Velez: Wesleyan has always stood out in my mind as a university that encourages activism and student engagement. As an instructor, there is nothing better than having a classroom full of thoughtful and interested students.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? YV: Ryan Enos, Dan Hopkins, and Ben Newman are some of my major influences. They’ve caused me to think about my research in a new way and are excellent people to boot.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? YV: One of the most satisfying aspects of teaching is watching students come in with very little background knowledge and leave with a deep understanding of the material. I love when students push back against the literature and craft their own arguments about the material.   A: What’s one project or idea you’re excited about right now? YV: I have a project examining the effects of residential mobility options on the desire for local residents to either fight or flee immigration. Given recent rhetoric on the topic and demographic trends in the U.S., I think understanding how citizens respond to immigrants is of importance. We need to do a better job of encouraging cooperation between native-born residents and immigrants.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Do you have any special talents or hobbies? YV: Music has always been a huge part of my life. I’ve been making electronic music since I was about 12 and I’m a classically trained guitarist. If I’m not conducting research or planning lessons, I’m likely playing guitar or messing with Ableton Live. It’s a stubborn passion of mine."

		"authors": "by Jake Lahut, Staff Writer",
		"content": "Government professor John Finn opens up about the Constitution, French cooking, and law school. c/o thegreatcourses.com Professor of Government John Finn, specializing in constitutional law, is the author of several books on constitutional theory and is currently writing a cookbook on omelets. He sat down with The Argus to discuss civic engagement, the inadequacies of American omelets, and how he drove his college to bankruptcy.   The Argus: Why teach at Wesleyan? John Finn: That’s an interesting question and one that I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about over the 25 to 30 years I’ve been here, because for some of my time here, I’ve had the distinct impression that some of my colleagues in the broadest sense of the term really doubt whether there’s an appropriate role for legal education in a liberal arts setting. And I want to be clear that it’s not my department [Government] that feels that way. It’s in the broadest sense. I get asked this question all the time: Why aren’t you teaching at a law school? I get asked by my colleagues. I get asked by my students. I get asked by Wesleyan alumni, by Wesleyan parents. And my answer is one that has really forced me to think about what the role of law is or should be in a liberal arts curriculum. So broadly speaking, I sort of subscribe to a really old fashioned notion that an important part of being a citizen in a liberal democracy is understanding that you have obligations to other people, not simply rights, and I think it’s a critical part of any liberal arts education to understand what citizenship means and to be engaged in citizenship as a real practical everyday kind of activity. My scholarship is centered around that question and I’d like to think my teaching is as well. I really feel comfortable at Wesleyan. I would not want to teach in a law school, which—without criticizing anything—is I think a little bit too pre-professional and narrow-minded for the sorts of things I would like to do.   A: Could you tell us more about your scholarship and how you would explain what you do to someone who may not even be that familiar with the Constitution itself? JF: My scholarship runs along two tracks that probably don’t have that much to do with each other. Most of it is centered around questions of constitutional theory both comparative and domestic. What I’m really interested in is how constitutional orders maintain themselves, how they survive, how they decay over time. I’m interested in other words, as I put it in my most recent book, what does it mean to live a constitutional way of life? So that’s not the study of Supreme Court cases per se, it’s not the study of constitutional provisions per se. It’s more about what it means to call ourselves a constitutional community and what do we need to do to make good on promises made to that community, as well as how we fail to achieve those promises.   A: When you’re not reading really dense legal texts about a document as vague as the Constitution, what do you like to read for pleasure or to simply inform yourself as a citizen? JF: That sort of builds on the last question. My other area of scholarship is food studies, so I spend a lot of time reading and collecting food books of all sorts. Some of them are as simple and straight forward as cookbooks, which I love to collect and read, but a lot of them are as advanced as food and cultural theory. Some of it exists in the margins. The book I read most recently that I got the most pleasure out of was a cookbook from the early 1970s written by Salvador Dali.   A: Salvador Dali wrote cookbooks? JF: Yeah! Well, one, anyway. [Laughs] If you know anything about Salvador Dali, you don’t have to see his name on the cover to know it’s quintessential Salvador Dali. I’m thinking about making a movie where over the course of a year I cook every single one of Dali’s recipes.   A: So, if I’m not mistaken, you’re a trained French chef. Could you tell us more about what it took to get certified? JF: This is something I probably shouldn’t say out loud, but I took one of my sabbaticals and went to culinary school in New York City at the French Culinary Institute. In any event, I’d like to think that the University got some value out of it, because I do teach food courses here from time to time, and I’ve published a fair amount on food-related stuff. So yeah, that was a blast. It was hard to get that degree. I can honestly say, of all of my higher degrees, I had more difficulty getting the culinary degree than any other one.   A: Could you please list your degrees so we could get some context on how difficult this was? JF: Yeah so, B.A. at Nasson College, which went bankrupt shortly after I graduated, maybe because I didn’t pay back my student loans, but I couldn’t have been the only one who did…. Then I got a law degree from Georgetown and a Masters and Ph.D from Princeton, and then the culinary degree. Of all of them, the culinary degree was far and away the most difficult—it’s the only one that was dangerous. I could and did hurt myself, whereas I was fine getting a Ph.D.   A: What does a good meal consist of for you now that you have this degree? JF: I still love to cook classical French and Continental European food. For right now, a good meal is a finely prepared omelet. I’m actually writing a cookbook on omelets, so I spend every weekend trying new recipes for omelets.   A: This might not make any difference, but I have a friend who’s really interested in the two different styles of omelet cooking, French and American. What’s the difference between the two? JF: One is classic and one is a cheap knockoff. [Laughs] No I don’t really mean that. The French omelet is softer, it shouldn’t have any color, and it’s runnier, whereas an American omelet is cooked more fully, it’s drier, and it’s pretty simple. You just fold the damn thing in half. My book has four master styles for the four kinds of omelets.   A: What advice would you give to a Wesleyan student considering going to law school? JF: First, I would say go into it eyes-open because even though some people think the market has rebounded—if it has at all—it’s a slow process, so it’s not like a law degree is like the Willy Wonka golden ticket to happiness. It’s a tough go, and there’s a reason why every survey on happiness puts lawyers at the very bottom of the list. But that said, the most important thing I would tell anyone thinking about going to law school is to major in whatever you want to major in. There’s no reason at all to think that you have to major in Government or one of the social sciences. I haven’t done this in a while and I’m glad you reminded me of it. When people come to me and say, “Should I go to law school?” I would give them a letter that Felix Frankfurter wrote to a 12-year-old boy that said, “Study whatever you want; learn to love learning.” There is no particular approach that’s going to make you better off or more prepared. I haven’t had the most successful life, but I ended up here without taking any law as an undergraduate. This interview was edited for length."

		"title": "University’s Greek Community Hosts Inaugural Harvest Festival",
		"date": "2015-10-12",
		"authors": "by Camille De Beus, Staff Writer",
		"content": "The University's InterGreek Council Hosted its first-ever Harvest Festival during Saturday's football game. Students and members of the community attended the inaugural Fall Harvest Festival, an event hosted by the University’s Greek life organizations, on Saturday, Oct. 10. “It’s a joint effort by the whole Greek community to bring in both the Middletown and Wesleyan communities,” president of the Inter Greek Council (IGC) and member of Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) Jason Brandner ’16 said. “We want to celebrate fall and allow children to have a safe space and a fun time [on campus].” According to the Coordinator of Greek Life, Zack Pfeifer, the idea for the Fall Harvest Festival came about during the spring of this year. Students involved in Greek life discussed their desire to host one or two large community outreach events in order to gain recognition for their community and the mission of Greek life. “In particular, they wanted to try and reach out to the Middletown larger community, to provide some outreach to the community that has traditionally been ostracized by some of the actions that Greek life has done on campus in the past,” Pfeifer said. “We wanted to reach out to them and give them this opportunity to come back and enjoy some games, athletics, and to play some family-friendly activities.” The six Greek societies that were present at the festival were AEPi, Alpha Delta Phi, Chi Psi, Psi Upsilon (Psi U), Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE), and Rho Epsilon Pi (Rho Ep). The Eclectic Society registered for the event but was absent, so its booth was run by other students in the community. “We figured each society could run one different booth of this festival, and that way everyone could kind of share responsibility and come up with their own games with their own style,” Psi U member and IGC Community Engagement Chair Abby Reed ’16 said. “But really, we’d all be working together so that kids could meet a big range of college students.” This festival is not just a collaboration between the University’s Greek life community. Reed said that they branched out by asking local businesses to join them. “[We] actually got a dentist to come,” Reed said. “We figured since we’re giving out candy and it’s Halloween we might as well have comprehensive health discussions.” The festival consisted of more than just booths and games. Additionally, the Greek community collected a large number of canned goods for the Office of Community Engagement’s Canned Goods Drive. “It’s going pretty well,” Brandner said. “We’ve got a fair amount of kids here. Everyone seems just to be having a great time. It’s putting together a kind of community service and community engagement [event]. It’s like having a fun time and doing Greek the Wes way.” This event is the first of many community engagement events the Greek community would like to organize this semester, in an effort to express its gratitude for, and be more involved in the community. “I personally would love to do it next year,” said Rho Ep member Hannah Skopicki ’18. “I’m just having the time of my life, and I’m really, really enjoying myself. It’s really nice for us to get to know more of the people in Middletown and for them to get to know us, and who we are.” Reed said the one improvement that could have been made to the festival was the way it was advertised. “Our downfall is we only started advertising for it a month ago,” Reed said. “So in future events, we’ll definitely want to advertise a lot more in advance. However, it’s our first time doing it, so by making this an inaugural event we’re hoping that each fall it’s something that Middletown can look forward to.” The festival was geared towards young children and families. Jessica Bisson traveled from Colby to see the football game. While attending the game, she also brought her children to the festival. “It was unexpected,” Bisson said. “We just traveled here from Maine for the football game. The kids really seem to be enjoying it, and it was a good way to break up the game for them. Face painting is always a hit.” The Fall Harvest Festival was more than a community engagement project for the University’s Greek community. “The focus isn’t really on Greek life,” Reed said. “It’s more just on interacting with kids and having fun.” This article has been edited to reflect that DKE was present at the event."

		"date": "2015-10-22",
		"authors": "by Molly Schiff, News Editor",
		"content": "Hyungsoo Kim ’02 returned to campus to share his experiences launching a successful Kickstarter Campaign. Molly Schiff, News Editor With the rise of crowdfunding websites such as KickStarter and Indiegogo, it may seem easier than ever to start a new enterprise. However, this is not the case; launching a successful crowdfunding campaign requires careful consideration and a lot of strategy. Hyungsoo Kim ’02, entrepreneur and creator of the Bradley Timepiece, returned to campus on Thursday, Oct. 22 to share the dos and don’ts of successful online fundraising. As part of the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship’s (PCSE) Fall Workshop series, Kim discussed the steps required to create, market, and effectively crowdfund a new product. He began by addressing how the advent of crowdfunding sites has transformed how entrepreneurs can raise funds for the initial phases of their product or services without having to give up too much of their company to investors or rely on family members. “Even three years ago, there was no such thing [as a crowdfunding website],” Kim said.  “You would have a really great idea, but no way of raising money, so there was no way to start anything if you didn’t have money, or your parents or family didn’t have money. So, the crowdfunding campaign had a huge impact on a lot of startup companies as well as people who run social campaigns.” As opposed to the traditional investment model, where one develops a product with financing from investors—to whom one generally gives a large stake of their companies in exchange—the crowdfunding process maintains the entrepreneur’s independence by reversing the process by which a product or service comes into existence. “Now, [when] you have the prototype, and then you post it on Kickstarter, and then all of the marketing…is free, basically,” Kim said. “Five percent of the money you raise, you pay to Kickstarter, but it’s not that much. And, if you don’t make any money, you don’t pay.” Kim then used his own product as a model, detailing the way in which he successfully crowdsourced the initial phases producing the Bradley Timepiece, a watch that allows wearers to tell the time through the senses of sight and touch. The project was inspired the discontent expressed by one of his classmates at the MIT Sloan School of Management where he earned his MBA, who was blind and could not find a watch that was both stylish and functional. Though talking watches and watches with open faces were available, the former was disruptive and the latter rather useless, as the hands would easily be shifted. “I was really surprised that there was nothing else,” he said. “There should be something else.” So, with a team of engineers and designers, Kim created the Bradley Timepiece and embarked on the process of marketing, crowdfunding, and selling it. He stressed the importance of generating buzz around a product before launching a Kickstarter campaign, as the first few days that it is can make or break its success. Kim and his team did this by making a video as well as social media pages. Generally, Kim noted that the most effective advertisements for mainstream products were those focused on the design of a product and were generally about a minute and a half long. However, his video, featuring the story of Brad Snyder, veteran and Paralympic champion who lost his sight while on active duty in Afghanistan clocks in at about six minutes. Katya Sapozhnina ’16, founder and president of the Wesleyan Entrepreneurship Society, asked Kim about his risky decision to create such a long video that advertised the product from a personal angle. “I wanted to ask about the video and why you chose to focus on the personal story of someone who is blind versus the cool design aspects,” Sapozhnina said. Kim responded that he took such a risk because he felt the story was compelling (so much so that he named the watch after Snyder) and would achieve one of Snyder’s goals of bridging the gap between the blind and the sighted. “We wanted to connect people, those who are visually impaired and those who are sighted,” Kim said. “We wanted to break down the wall between them.” Additionally, Kim reached out to many bloggers in order to begin circulating information about the product and impending Kickstarter campaign. In total, he got media attention from about a dozen different sources prior to the page’s launching. All of this preparation work led to a strong start, which put him on the front page of the website for four days. That exposure, gained either by popularity or staff picks, is what can make or break a project’s crowdfunding campaign. He also made note of the modest goal he posted on the site : $40 thousand. “Our internal goal was $80 thousand,” Kim said. “But we put $40 thousand because if you don’t reach your goal, you don’t get any [of the donated funds].” Employing these strategies, Kim was able to raise approximately $500 thousand in the 30-day period during which the page was live. Sapozhnina found the presentation informative and encouraging. “I think crowdfunding is wonderful because it makes being an entrepreneur more accessible,” she said. “We can now use very little money while raising thousands, even before making the product.” Jennifer Roach ’14, Civic Engagement Fellow for the Center of Community Partnerships, noted the universality and applicability of Kim’s work to students’ work at the University and beyond. “Whatever project they end up doing, whatever organizations or business they end up starting, crowdfunding is one of those tools that might be useful to a lot of students working on any number of projects,” said Roach. “It’s applicable if you’re doing nonprofit work, if you’re at an educational institution…it can even be used for a political campaign. It’s very cool to be able to have [the opportunity], any time that you get a chance to learn from someone who has started their own business, who has done something that you’re interested in after graduation, whether or not you’re interested in crowdfunding.” For all students, there is a lesson to be learned from someone who has been there before. “You never know what you’re going to get out of one of these workshops,” Roach said."

		"title": "WSA Approves Legislative Pathway for Student Petitions",
		"date": "2015-11-12",
		"authors": "by Molly Schiff, News Editor",
		"content": "Resolution 4.37, passed at the Nov. 7 Senate Meeting, aims to increase transparency and participation in the WSA's legislative process. In an effort to improve its representation of the student body, the Wesleyan Student Assembly Senate passed new legislation on Sunday, Nov. 8 that will enhance students’ abilities to directly influence the legislation that make it onto each meeting’s agenda. Resolution 4.37 will set up new protocol for students to introduce resolutions directly to the Senate. It passed by a measure of 23-0, with four votes abstaining. Previously, students interested in introducing legislation—such as petitions that have gained popular support through signatures—had to find an elected WSA member to sponsor the bill and present it on their behalves. The resolution acknowledges this situation, amending section 5.05 of its bylaws to provide a mechanism by which these students can directly submit their proposals to the WSA. WSA Senate member Jacob Maiman-Stadtmauer ’19 introduced the resolution as a way to provide a pathway for the often-confusing process. He feels that this will provide a measure of transparency to the WSA’s legislative processes. “Personally, I’m really excited about this resolution because it makes the WSA more transparent and democratic,” Maiman-Stadmauer wrote in an email to The Argus. “Through crystallizing and publishing the process for the WSA responding to resolutions we’ve been able to make the Assembly that much more transparent. Additionally, through allowing the larger student body to directly propose solutions to problems or bring new problems to light through resolutions, we’ve been able to make the WSA more democratic.” Student-introduced resolutions must meet a set of eligibility requirements in order to be considered. First, all pieces of proposed legislation must be formatted in the same way as all Senate member-introduced resolutions. Students who have trouble meeting this requirement are encouraged to meet with the Chief of Staff in order to ensure their proposal is properly written. Current Chief of Staff John Henry Vansant ’18 elaborated on the role he will play in drafting legislation. “As the Resolution specifies, my role as the Chief of Staff will be to facilitate this effort by assisting ‘the author/s of the proposal to change it into appropriate form,’” Vansant wrote in an email to The Argus. “Since the WSA votes on resolutions, petitions need to be translated into resolution form. The Chief of Staff’s role is then to alleviate this burden of having to format a petition by helping students out with the editing. The WSA recognizes that procedures should not inhibit student voices from being heard, so my role as Chief of Staff is to make sure that petitions will be introduced and discussed without any setbacks.” Second, each resolution must obtain a minimum number of student signatures, determined by voter turnout and subject to change from year to year. “[The] number of signatures required will be set equal to the number of votes that the elected Wesleyan Student Assembly member who was elected with the least number of votes garnered,” Resolution 4.37 reads. While this process may appear overly intricate, Maiman-Stadmauer explained that this particular requirement was determined in the interest of democracy. “This formula may seem complicated, but we felt that if a student could be given the full privileges of any senator with a given number of votes, there’s no reason that students shouldn’t be able to introduce resolutions with a number of supporters equal to that,” he wrote. Students whose proposals meet the standards outlined by the document will also be responsible for presenting their resolutions to members of the WSA. This increased level of direct student non-member participation in the WSA legislative process was instituted with the overall goals of the WSA in mind. “Through allowing the larger student body to directly propose solutions to problems or bring new problems to light through resolutions, we’ve been able to make the WSA more democratic,” wrote Maidman-Stadmauer. “This resolution will also make the WSA more democratic by allowing the larger student body to have a direct and formal say in the WSA through more than just the [biannual] elections. This resolution builds on the recent steps in the last year or so towards becoming more democratic, transparent, and responsive to the student body.” WSA President Kate Cullen ’16 looks forward to seeing the positive impact this resolution intends have on the University. “I commend Jacob for bringing this resolution forward and pushing all of us on the WSA to think more critically about our commitment to transparency, accountability, and greater civic engagement,” said Cullen in an email to The Argus. “This new resolution well exemplifies those values and I am excited to see what opportunities it will bring for open discourse.”"

		"title": "Douglas Cannon Society, Demystified",
		"date": "2015-11-16",
		"authors": "by Emma Davis, Rajaa Elidrissi, Staff Writer & Community Editor",
		"content": "The Argus examines the secret society with custody of the infamous cannon.The University is host to a number of not-so-secret societies, including Skull and Serpent, Mystical Seven, and Theta Nu Epsilon. Perhaps the most mysterious is the Douglas Cannon Society, known only for its association with the lone campus cannon. The Cannon Society has taken responsibility for multiple sightings of the Douglas Cannon, a brass cannon at the heart of one of the University’s longest-running pranks. The cannon itself is a relic from the mid-19th century, when the University was in session during the Fourth of July and celebrated the holiday with a student-led volley of cannon fire. After the academic calendar changed in 1859, the University incorporated the campus cannons into annual festivities for George Washington’s birthday. An intense interclass rivalry developed between the first-years, who were assigned to fire the cannons on the morning of Feb. 22, and the sophomores, who tried to thwart the first-years’ efforts. The clashes evolved into a tradition known as “cannon scraps,” which became so extreme that by 1916 the student body voted to discontinue the use of the cannons. During the 1867 cannon scrap, the Douglas Cannon was borrowed from a local artillery regiment named after former Middletown mayor Benjamin Douglas. The cannon was given to the University as a gift at the turn of the century, and in 1931, it was filled with lead and installed in what was intended as its final resting place on campus. But 26 years later, a mischievous group of students hacked the cannon away from its pedestal and began placing it in locations around the world. The cannon has traveled to New York, Iowa, Washington, D.C., London, Paris, and Venezuela and was almost part of a delegation to the U.S.S.R., according to the University’s blog and an online exhibit from Olin Library’s Special Collections and Archives. The cannon has also materialized at several University-sponsored events. In 1981, the cannon was baked into the University’s sesquicentennial birthday cake, and in 2007, it made a brief appearance during President Michael Roth’s inauguration reception. In 2012, former Argus editor-in-chief Claire Bradach ’15 speculated that the cannon had come under University control. Previously, during the 1960s, a group called “Cannon Retrievers United South of Heaven” (CRUSH) had claimed to be the cannon’s handlers, sending letters to The Argus detailing its whereabouts. In 2000, a group called  “Cannon Liberators Aiming West” (CLAW) took over the role. The two organizations may have been precursors of the current Douglas Cannon Society, which has also reached out to The Argus about the cannon’s location (and recently began communicating with wesleying). Last spring, the Society shared what appears to be a photo of its members, their faces covered by black hoods. Unlike members of other secret societies, who reveal themselves by wearing pins on their gowns during graduation, members of the Cannon Society never disclose their identities. Today’s Cannon Society has approximately 10 members, making it the smallest secret society on campus, an anonymous source explained. “The fewer members, the fewer people know we exist,” the source said. According to a second source within the group, the Cannon Society is a senior secret society, with new members initiated during their junior year. Initiations are normally held in the spring, but there might be a second initiation if a selected member is abroad during that semester. Aside from its guardianship of the Douglas Cannon, the Society’s purpose is unclear, leaving some students to wonder whether it functions as much more than a social network. However, the Cannon Society seems to have had an affiliation with WesUnity, a now-defunct student group. While active, WesUnity was a “student-run organization which maintained a compendium of links and news relating to activism on the campus of Wesleyan University as well as links to national and local resources,” according to WSA archives. Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Whaley hinted at the connection between the two groups in an email to The Argus, describing the mission of the Cannon Society as highly similar to that of WesUnity. “The members [of the Douglas Cannon Society] are dedicated to discussing campus issues and building bridges on campus to promote unity and enhance the sense of community,” Whaley wrote. Yet WesUnity is best known for hosting concerts, such as Girl Talk in 2008 and Matisyahu and Chiddy Bang in 2011. The latter was announced to campus in an email titled “Douglas Cannon” and prompted so much controversy over its funding—$55,000 allotted to WesUnity anonymously—that the WSA’s Concert Committee was forced to reevaluate its bylaws. In 2013, WesUnity created a Twitter account with the description “DUGG LESS CAN NAAN.” That same year, the group hosted “Chalk de Franzia,” an event to protest the University’s bans on the Tour de Franzia and chalking on campus. But when asked about the link between WesUnity and the Douglas Cannon Society, the sources declined to comment. Likewise, the current WSA, despite having provided funding to WesUnity in the past, denies any involvement with the Cannon Society. “Neither the WSA nor the SBC at large funds or [has] any knowledge of funding the Cannon Society,” said WSA Office Manager Arpita Vora ’16. “I don’t think we fund any secret societies, actually.” Current Student Budget Committee (SBC) Chair Evelysse Vargas ’17 concurred. “The SBC doesn’t knowingly fund the operational costs of exclusive societies, [which] includes secret societies,” Vargas wrote in a message to The Argus. “[But] I can’t speak to any funding before 2013, when OrgSync was first instituted.” So who are the Douglas Cannon’s elusive custodians? What will they cook up next? And whose money will they use? These are questions that only the Society can answer."

		"date": "2016-02-11",
		"authors": "by Jake Lahut, Assistant Opinion Editor",
		"content": "c/o berkshireonstage.com Pamela Tatge ’84 (pronounced “Tad-gee”) has been serving as Director of Wesleyan’s Center for the Arts (CFA) for the last 16 years, but she’s been a part of the University community ever since arriving to campus in 1980 as a first-year student. She is moving on in April to become the Executive Director at Jacob’s Pillow, a dance center and school in the Berkshires with the oldest summer dance festival in the United States. Tatge spoke to The Argus about the arts at the University, ranging from her time living in Eclectic to Wesleyan’s renowned dance pedagogy and diversity.  “Wesleyan has an incredible history in the arts,” Tatge said. “First off, by dedicating 11 buildings to the arts in 1973, the idea that we built a center for the arts and that a small liberal arts college would have this kind of rich dedicated space for each of the disciplines, was really extraordinary.”  When asked what the state of the arts was by the time she returned to the University as director of the CFA in the fall of 1999, Tatge noted that the University was already a unique place for artistic activities.  “When I arrived in 1999, there were already astonishing facilities,” Tatge said. “Wesleyan was one of the few universities in the country in the 1960s to think about teaching non-Western Art. So, in the music department in particular, they felt that they had to go beyond our sights. They invited artists from Indonesia, India, and West Africa to teach in the program, and the World Music and the World Dance Programs were born there. The richness [of these programs] was in the ether, it was in the fiber; it was a very international place.”  Although the arts were rich and rather cosmopolitan at Wesleyan when Tatge arrived, they were conversely also insular in that they were mostly oriented towards the campus alone. Tatge noticed this conundrum right away, and began to try to make Wesleyan an artistic center for Connecticut at large.  “The programming at the Center for the Arts was generally directed towards the campus, and artists of great note were brought [in],” Tatge noted.“But there was not, I would say, an active engagement with the community, in other words, active marketing. There was no box office system, it was hard tickets. You didn’t know who was coming and going through the door. So, [there was] an incredibly solid foundation for the arts at Wesleyan, but without, let’s say, a real dedication of resources to engaging with the community.” One of the main reasons why Jacob’s Pillow noticed Tatge as a formidable candidate was because of her innovations in dance at Wesleyan. She found to be a way to make not only her mark at the school, but also Wesleyan’s mark in the arts more broadly, due to the pedagogical opportunities dance presents, as well as how the performance of dance can synthesize the arts into a total work of art.  “When I looked around to say, ‘How can Wesleyan make its mark? How can it distinguish itself in the total ecology of the arts in the state?’ I realized two things,” Tatge recalled.“First of all, Wesleyan had a rich history in dance. It was one of the first liberal arts colleges to have dance [as] an academic subject separate from theater or, as Williams [designates it], the physical education department. So, number one, Wesleyan had a history circularly in dance.” The second part of Tatge’s realization lay in the power of the pen: “Wesleyan University Press is one of the premier publishers of dance scholarship in our country.”  Finally, Tatge looked at the student engagement in dance at Wesleyan. “I don’t know what the statistic was when I started, but right now forty percent of Wesleyan students graduate having taken a dance class. Forty percent. So with all of that being true, I then looked outward and realized that there are very few places to see contemporary dance in our state… I thought, ‘Okay, this is where we can create a niche for ourselves.’”  Then, with the cooperation of the Dance Department, Tatge cofounded the Breaking Ground Dance Series in the fall of 2000. The goal was to identify three companies annually that would represent the “next wave,” as Tatge calls it, of innovation in dance that has a social justice message and also an international component to it.  “That’s one of the distinctive things about Wesleyan,” Tatge expressed. “Instead of having an independent curator come in and say, ‘You should have this, that, and the other,’ and then scurrying around to get engagement by the departments and students and faculty, we actually dialogue with the faculty and students up front, and say, ‘Who are you excited about?’” Tatge also weighed in on how Wesleyan has changed culturally from her time here as a student and over the course of her tenure at the helm of the CFA. Her answer was different than those of most alumni.  “I do think that society has changed and our culture has changed so that students have much more pressure on them in terms of their career choices and because of the cost of their education, repaying debt, etcetera,” she said. “So perhaps they don’t have the freedom of choice that we had when I was graduating.” When asked if students’ choices are now more utilitarian than they were during her time as a student, Tatge pointed to the phenomenon of double majoring and making what one studies more “marketable.”  “[Students now have] more direction in terms of how marketable their major is going to be,” Tatge said. “I think there’s pressure on students to question that in ways that we didn’t have to. How have students answered that? There are many more double majors than there were when I went to school.” Tatge also noted that students are more diverse and international than they were during her time here in the 1980s, which she thinks has enriched the culture of the school greatly. She also pointed out the “entrepreneurial smarts” that students seem to have today that they didn’t a few decades ago, which, coupled with technology, has astonished Tatge in the kinds of endeavors that students have launched while still undergrads.  Wesleyan’s music scene is also a source of great pride for Tatge, who was a member of Eclectic and lived there.  “We always have had a music subculture that was just incredible, like at Eclectic,” Tatge said. “I lived at Eclectic [because] I loved to dance, so there were great bands that were there all the time. I always felt like I never took this place for granted and I went to a place that allowed me to do so much, and I think that’s still true.”"

		"title": "The Future of a Wes Resource Center",
		"date": "2016-02-18",
		"authors": "by Azher Jaweed, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "Last November, the Is This Why campaign presented five demands to University President Michael Roth, one of which was the “Establishment of a Multicultural Center and a Director of Multicultural Affairs.” The center, according to the Is This Why website, was envisioned as a non-residential space that would facilitate community and support among students who come from historically marginalized backgrounds. According to the website, the space would be used by students interested in social programming, advocacy, education, and community engagement. The idea of a multicultural center may seem similar to other places at the University, like the University Organizing Center (UOC) or the Center for African American Studies (CAAS), but the UOC is a student run space and CAAS is specific to African American Studies and students from the African diaspora. The multicultural center would be funded by the administration and open for all students from marginalized backgrounds.  Current Discourse A lot has changed since the Is This Why campaign presented its demands on Nov. 18. On Nov. 20, Roth announced a new task force, chaired by Professor of Anthropology Gina Athena Ulysse, Shardonay Pagett ’18, and Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias. “At the end of last semester I indicated we would be creating a task force to explore the establishment of a multicultural resource center as part of our broader effort to improve equity and inclusion on campus,” Roth wrote in an email to all students on Jan. 7. The structure is now referred to as the Resource Center instead of the Multicultural Center, and may also encompass the roles of a gender resource center and first-generation, low-income student center.     This is actually not the first committee tasked with drafting recommendations for a multicultural center at the University. Back in 1990, a “Multicultural Committee” co-chaired by Khachig Tölölyan, now Director of the College of Letters, and Diem Ha ’93, along with eight other members, was similarly tasked with, according to the minutes of the first meeting, creating recommendations about the establishment of a multicultural center. On May 1, 1991, the committee recommended hiring a multicultural coordinator, but decided against establishing a physical multicultural center. On Feb. 8, Roth stated that he had yet to form personal opinions about the establishment of a center.  “I’m waiting to hear what a multicultural resource center will do,” he said. “How do we know it’ll be successful? How will it relate to other things we do? So I’m just waiting to hear what students want and what it will do.” Part of the reason Roth is waiting for final recommendations, he said, is due to problems with student use in previous resource centers. “We’ve had resource centers in the past and they haven’t been used very much by students after they initially opened, so I want to make sure this is something that will have a meaningful impact,” Roth added.   Lily Kong ’16, one of four students involved in drafting a proposal for the Gender Resource Center, thinks that the administration should play a larger role in maintaining such spaces once they have been established. “Part of the reason why the administration is concerned is because there was a Women’s Center in the 80s and another in the 2000s,” Kong said. “The administration’s question is why would it be different now? It’s like the same as the multicultural center…. My response to that question is that the reason the center hasn’t worked out in the past is because the administration has not been supportive of the students, not because the students don’t care.”  The Equity Task Force published its interim report online Feb. 14. The report succinctly discusses the history of how Wesleyan has faced the challenge of dealing with issues of inclusion and discrimination. “Previous committees and task forces show that Wesleyan has made multiple attempts to address issues of difference and racial tensions, but to limited success at best,” the report reads. “The same problems keep recurring.”  The report continues by stating its initial recommendation.  “[This Report recommends the] creation of an integrative educational experience that will continue to reach across all parts of campus life including students, staff, and faculty, through a physical center and institutional initiatives for the indefinite future,” the report reads.  It is important to note that these are not the final recommendations, but only the work that the committee has done so far. The final report will be published on May 1 after the task force finishes the discovery phase and conducts field research on the topic.  Resource Centers in Other Universities Unlike Wesleyan, other schools in the NESCAC have established physical spaces for historically marginalized students. Bowdoin College has the Student Center for Multicultural Life, the purpose of which is to create a supportive space dedicated to historically underrepresented students.  “[The Student Center for Multicultural Life provides] a home away from home for students from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented at Bowdoin (specifically first generation students, students of racial and ethnic minorities, and low-income students),” the Bowdoin College Center’s website reads.  Bowdoin provides a functioning example of a space that the Is This Why campaign envisioned, and it is not an exception.  Amherst College has the Multicultural Resource Center. “The Center fosters the development of identity consciousness, allyship, leadership, and social justice within the Amherst community,” the Amherst College Center’s website reads. “As such, it designs programs, facilitates discussions, advises student groups, and provides workshops and trainings.” Hamilton College has the Days-Massolo Center at Hamilton College.  “The center’s mission is to promote community inclusion, engage in intercultural dialogue, build collaborations, and establish partnerships that help make Hamilton College a welcoming environment for faculty, staff, and students,” the Hamilton College website reads. The Pugh Center at Colby College, the Davis Center at Williams College, and the Office of Multicultural Education in Bates are also examples of centralized services for historically marginalized groups.  Although Tufts University, Trinity College, and Connecticut College do not have similar services in one physical structure, they offer services for groups like LGBTQ+ students, international students, and women in separate locations. Prospects for the Future Some individuals from the Is This Why campaign and the student advisory board have looked to the other groups for essential knowledge about submitting proposals working with administration. One such group is the Gender Resource Center (GRC) team, which is chaired by, Kong, Nina Gurak ’16, Isabel Alter ’17, and Michelle J. Lee ’16, four students who have spent the last two and a half years creating a concrete GRC proposal with the help of students, faculty, and staff.  The team has a similar rationale for demanding a space as the Is This Why campaign.  “Often what we were doing was replicated by groups before us, and how that information is lost because there is no strong mechanism,” Gurak said. “And part of that has to do with having a space. Although a space is not the answer to gender equity, racial justice, or anything like that, it just creates a space where people can go if they have questions. And especially…we were finding feminist activism to be so fragmented that having a space to center that would be really exciting.” According to Kong, the GRC continues to face recurring problems when making proposals to create a gender resource center. “There has been a lot of back-and-forth with the administration where they tell us what edits we need to make, us making them, and then giving us even more concerns, or even telling us do the opposite of what they told us to do in the past,” Kong said.  The “back-and-forth” between students and administration, Farias said, is often a critique by students who work with administration.  “If something as complex as a research paper requires many drafts, then something even more complex such as creating a center, something that will last, is far more complex than that,” Farias said. “The back-and-forth is not about dragging feet, but it’s actually about making the suggestion better.” The current status of the GRC may serve as a forecast for future hurdles that the Equity and Inclusion Task Force, Student Advisory Board, and other groups working on the Resource Center may face.  One suggestion Caroline Liu ’18, a student member of the Equity Task Force, has for the community is to hold the task force accountable and take all feedback under consideration.  Going back to the plans of the current resource center, Hailey Broughton-Jones ’18, a student who contributed in drafting the demands and also a member of the Student Advisory Board, believes that the task force must have a long-term commitment to promoting equity and inclusion. “We need a structure that is embedded in the institution of the university and will be positioned so that it will continue to represent our presence far past when we graduate,” Broughton-Jones said. She also suggests that to properly solve problems of equity and inclusion on campus the task force must exist beyond May 1, the expected date for the final report from the Equity and Inclusion Task Force. “The equity task force was born out of student pressure, and if that pressure is gone the committee will most likely dissolve,” she said. “We need to address boundaries between student, faculty, and staff and also combat the hierarchies between those groups to properly discuss the creation of a Resource Center.”  Farias says such a proposal was discussed in the interim report. “There was a recommendation that the president consider continuing a task force in some iteration, whether the same members, or a recompilation of members, and then also an eventual standing committee that has to do with diversity and inclusion and equity,” Farias said."

		"title": "Age Beyond Numbers",
		"date": "2016-02-29",
		"authors": "by Sammi Aibinder, Opinion Editor",
		"content": "c/o damronchiropractic.com A little over a year ago, my 88 year-old grandmother took a fall that ended up sparking a whole slew of medical problems that landed her in the hospital for a while. Both the fall and her stay in the hospital took a major toll on her body, eventually leading to a transfer to a rehabilitation center and nursing home complex so that she could regain her strength. Of course, Grammy’s time in the rehab center had its disheartening moments: She was in a lot of pain, and it took a level of endurance to get herself back on her feet (literally) that none of the rest of our family, relatively young and spry, could imagine. But I thought the place was nice. She was getting quality therapy and assistance, and made quite a few friends and admirers among the other residents during her time there. My mother could agree with about as much in terms of the center’s benefits, but she was nevertheless pretty miserable in that space. She expressed to me on more than one occasion how spending the last years of her life in a nursing home is one of the more depressing things she could imagine. This got me to thinking about the different ways in which we typically conceptualize old age, how the elderly engage with the rest of society, and how to improve senior living spaces to the advantage of everyone. One of the obvious things about a nursing home, a retirement community, or an assisted-living space is that the residents are old. But I think that a lot of people who feel dispirited by these kinds of environments aren’t necessarily upset by old age in general; after all, old age is often a cause for celebration and joy. The experiences and knowledge we can gain from older generations are invaluable. Instead, the reason for the aversion to senior living spaces has a lot more to do with how society typically defines aging well, and how residents in those places tend to illustrate the criteria commonly associated with having aged poorly. Last November, Professor Shellae Versey presented a lecture at the College of the Environment’s annual symposium, “Where on Earth Are We Going?” that raised this very question of what it means to “age well,” and how the common definition tends to be pretty narrow. She discussed biological factors that come into play—like being free of disease, having high physical and mental functioning, and generally being self-sufficient—as well as socialfactors, like the extent to which a person engages with other people and their general surroundings. Professor Versey emphasized the importance of establishing our own personal gauges for what it means to age well, and her own research additionally suggested the significance of the social engagement component. As we climb up into old age, we are likely a lot more apt to consider the conditions of our personal bodies over our social environments in relation to our physical and mental health. But Professor Versey’s research indicates that what she calls “generativity” (the satisfaction of giving to others) increases with old age, that feeling useful (through your social environment) can make or break your physical health, and that as we get older and older, the influence of genetics on health declines while the influence of environment goes up. This knowledge points to the ways in which senior-living spaces could be made better, and why people may feel they are unfavorable in general. My particular qualms with senior living spaces have to do with how they encourage residents to connect with others outside of the residence, in light of the positive impacts that “generativity” and feeling useful can have on health (especially in old age). I think that this connection could be improved by shifting how we think about integrating different-aged communities, like connecting pre-schools and elementary schools with surrounding older-aged communities. For example, I can recall countless choral and dance performances of my childhood at senior living communities. Granted, I think that the residents were very pleased by these recitals—regardless of how well they could hear the music. Such is the effect of having a break in the monotonous age dynamic typically present in those spaces. But there are better options. Another activity in which my elementary school partook was having special days for residents from senior living communities to come to school and teach us how to sew. There is clearly much more of an engagement component in the latter example; the residents were taking an active role in our learning experiences, thus giving back to their community in a more effectual way than being passive audience members. This kind of intergenerational engagement has been developed in different ways, all over the world, for a long time. A nursing home in Seattle called Providence Mount St. Vincent shares its facilities with a pre-school five days a week. Established in 1991, the program is called an Intergenerational Learning Center (ILC) and provides social interaction between the two age groups to flourish and develop a reciprocal relationship of learning and care. Seattle is not the birthplace of this idea: It originated in Japan and has spread across the U.S. and Canada. Another example of intergenerational engagement from Professor Versey’s research is the idea of having university-based retirement communities; in other words, setting up a senior living space in proximity to a university to promote the greater community’s use of university resources. Wesleyan’s Wasch Center for Retired Faculty currently runs the Wesleyan Institute for Lifelong Learning, designed to extend Wesleyan’s educational resources beyond just enrolled students. Perhaps this program can be extended to senior-living communities in the greater Middlesex County area, and also be developed to increase student accessibility.  Moving towards intergenerational spaces, and keeping an emphasis on how they can foster social engagement that is key to human health, is one way to have a positive impact on how we view old age and care for the aged. These spaces can help expand common conceptions of what old age entails, and break the stigma that being old means being static and out of touch with the rest of society.

		"title": "Raising the Bar: Wesleyan and Vines on Church",
		"date": "2016-03-28",
		"authors": "by Julian Johnson, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "It’s hump day. You have a 9 a.m. tomorrow, but you still want to go out and let off some steam. That guy you’ve been eyeing will be there, and you’ll be able to dance your heart out. Maybe your friends will be way too sloppy drunk, but it’s okay because it’s BAR NIGHT! Especially if you’re an athlete and you have games on the weekend, this is your night. But in the midst of the drunken small talk and getting sandwiched by two brawny basketball players, have you thought about the story of Vines on Church? Meet Neil Baloga. He grew up on the other side of the bridge, and he took over Vines on Church about a year ago with the intention of turning it into the “quintessential Wesleyan bar.” He’s dealt with everything from customers stealing paintings, to paranormal activity, to the case of Obama’s visiting nephew peeing in his closet (according to Baloga). With the hoard of people who storm the bar every Wednesday, you’d think the bar was making a killing. But Baloga says the opposite is true. “To tell you the truth, since I started here, I haven’t taken home a paycheck, and we’re always on the verge of closing,” he said.“I have to spend so much on security, inventory, cleanup, and, when it happens, theft. I’m barely paying the electricity bill with what happens on Wednesday nights, which is sad because it’s really the only night I have here.” Most Wesleyan students pregame before they go to bar night because they want to save money or they want to partake in the ritual with their friends. But this is taking a toll on Vines on Church’s business. Neil had to stop taking Middletown cash because he couldn’t pay his Internet bill. When asked about the possibility of closing, he expressed more concern for his employees and the tenants. “I hired primarily people that were coming from addiction backgrounds,” he said. “A lot of the people that live here upstairs are in programs. There’s a family of four and three workers that depend on housing.” If the place shut down, “the people that put their pride and faith into this place and work so hard for next to nothing” would be “ass out.” For most of us University students, this is the one place in town that we truly frequent, and it’s barely off campus. We already don’t have a great relationship with the Middletown community. As Neil puts it, “the two crowds are like oil and water.” There are many excuses for this, including age differences and socioeconomic division, but as a school that prides itself on inclusivity and community engagement, there is certainly room for improvement. Neil, on the other hand, has a strong relationship with Middletown residents. During our interview, a man walked into the bar and asked Neil, “How often do you use the garage?” Without even asking, he said, “Use it,” and told him to make a copy of his key. In contrast to his generous character, we tend to come into bar night and abuse the space with very little reciprocity. On Wednesdays, according to Baloga, Middletown residents “avoid this place like the plague.” Instead of focusing on the negatives, let’s focus on the positive possibilities. People complain about frats being shut down and parties being overcrowded because there are so few options on campus, but this is a space that we are welcome to use. To all of you who want to show your art and who are confused by the event planning process, this is your new place, and it’s unregulated by Wesleyan. This is a call to anyone involved in music, stand-up, photography, painting, improv, poetry slams, interpretive dancing, performance art, etc. Let’s seize this opportunity to foster a better relationship with the town and help improve the night life. Not to mention, Neil has been cooking for 14 years and he can make some dope food. If any of you have any ideas for this space, feel free to reach out to me (and I could also get you in touch with Neil). Johnson is a member of the class of 2019."

		"title": "The Wesleyan Condition: Endless Intellectual Curiosity",
		"date": "2016-04-11",
		"authors": "by Jake Lahut, Opinion Editor",
		"content": "The Wesleyan Condition is an endless curiosity that can never go far enough. No matter what academic category our curiosities may fall under, we find ways to make them relevant to many others. This never-ending intersectional curiosity leads us to question the very underpinnings of almost everything, including our own time. This is why Wesleyan is called a “radical” school, because we are radical in the truest sense. We question the very underpinnings of everything, often to the annoyance of our friends and family back home. This questioning can and should lead us to be quite uncomfortable with many aspects of modernity. Although we do not all share the same tactics in our efforts to make the world a better place, some form of civic engagement is what unites Wesleyan students in their collective, intellectual endeavor while they study in Middletown. There are certainly students at the University who consider themselves apolitical, but there is really no such thing as being apolitical, both in the “real world” and at the University. We are all connected, and we all have opinions and beliefs that affect how we act, whether we know it or not. For most people, Wesleyan is a hyper-liberal atmosphere where it feels like the far left is never far enough. This leads many students to conclude over their time here that they “became more conservative,” or discovered what they “really believe.” Conversely, we all know someone who has become substantially more radical in their beliefs over the course of their time at the University. I would argue that these phenomena stem from the same root: a confrontation with progressive thought that can be so new, foreign, and even scary that it profoundly changes us, whether immediately or over time, whether for better or worse. I would like to believe that people changing at a progressive school is a good thing, especially because I truly believe that this stems from genuine intellectual curiosity. However, we are also producing a new form of intolerance at Wesleyan that I hope will be merely a flash in the pan rather than the beginning of a new trend in the twenty-first century. As many prospective students like we once were descend upon campus for WesFest, we are reminded of our own hopes and preconceived notions of the University, and one of the most common ones is that it is an incredibly tolerant place. Although inclusion is part of the ethos of this school—as can be seen with our gender neutral bathrooms, African American Studies program, experimental artwork, and speech code—all of these cases are at the very least the partial result of grassroots student activism that worked to improve the status quo that was at one point, and in some ways still is, intolerant. The Is This Why movement is the latest form of a long line of racial justice campaigns on this campus that go back to the very origins of the American Civil Rights Movement, where even Wesleyan professors went down South to join the Freedom Riders. Wesleyan is still a school with a majority of white students, and there seems to be a large disparity between who appears on the University home page and who is valued as a member of the community. Another important aspect of tolerance to address is that of dissenting opinion at one of the most progressive schools in the country. While we should never tolerate hate speech, we must allow room for dissent in our political discourse on campus. In fact, we should encourage dissent so that our views can be stronger. Yet in practice, the tendency of students trying to “out-left” each other when weighing in on topics on social media or even in the classroom can lead students who haven’t made up their minds or who have a different opinion to remain in silence. This is not the kind of civic engagement we should be producing at a school of this quality. Of course there are historical narratives that are important to keep in mind regarding more conservative opinions that are more predominant in the United States, such as white-supremacy, male-supremacy, heteronormativity, and the countless others that we ought to learn more about while we are here. This is not, however, an excuse to shelter oneself from dissenting opinion during one’s time at the University. Many students already cannot shelter themselves from societal forces that are supposed to be absent at Wesleyan, such as being asked to present one’s student ID as a student of color when using University transportation, or being asked where one is “really from” as a student of color. Although Wesleyan is a bubble to a large extent, it is never separated from the world or the U.S. in its problems. This unease with what is and what ought to be, with the past and present, with off-campus and on-campus, is what drives the intellectual curiosity that makes our school so great. Our campus debates do not always have two sides, with sometimes three, four, or more viewpoints being represented on issues ranging from Israeli-Palestinian relations to cultural appropriation in program housing. As our vocabularies grow with words that will be unrecognizable to our friends and family at Thanksgiving dinner, we also grow as people during our time here thanks to the deep reservoirs of emotion and knowledge within each of member of the Wesleyan community. While I’m not promising a complete identity crisis or makeover to come with one’s degree from the University, I do believe that the coupling of this school’s culture with its intellectual rigor will drive you to always want to learn more, and to hopefully never settle for what is, choosing instead to question the underpinnings of whatever is in front of you, and to put the pieces back together in a better way as you move forward. So the next time you walk by the names and faces of our alumni, whether in the athletic center or in your department’s senior theses, take a moment to engage with their legacy to remind yourself that they never stopped questioning, and neither should you.

		"title": "A Dead Electorate: The Case for an American Monarchy",
		"date": "2016-04-18",

		"content": "When Benjamin Franklin left Independence Hall after the Second Drafting, he was approached by a woman on the street. The woman said, “Mr. Franklin, what manner of government have you bequeathed us?” And Franklin replied, “A republic, madam, if you can keep it.” The Founding Fathers viewed democracy as something to be earned and then vigorously defended. Election by the masses, a daring gambit at the time, could only be pulled off with the backing of a politically engaged, educated, and responsible electorate. The system would only work if all citizens performed their civic duties to the fullest, schooling themselves on the most pressing issues facing the union and casting an informed vote accordingly. These vaunted ideals and lofty goals make it all the more painful to admit that Americans have forfeited their right to Benjamin Franklin’s republic. The Great Experiment has failed. The American public today is a far cry from the model electorate envisioned by the Framers, as evidenced by the country’s massive civic literacy crisis. Americans are woefully unequipped to make the kinds of nuanced voting decisions that a modern democracy demands. Whether and to what extent this failure is attributable to poor education and general political apathy is difficult to pin down, but the statistics behind flagging civic literacy are as compelling as they are disturbing. According to the Associated Press, only one in four Americans can name a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. Most Americans believe their taxes are rising when they are actually falling, are unable to name the current vice president, and can’t clearly differentiate between most presidential candidates. The gap between what voters know and what they need to know will only widen as the workings of the government become more complex and civic education flatlines. If Americans can’t be bothered to learn even the most rudimentary facts about the federal budget, how can they be expected to make sound fiscal decisions? If they can’t find Afghanistan on a map, much less explain why the country waged a war there, how can the voting public possibly navigate an issue as complex as a rising China or a nuclear treaty? The unfortunate answer is that they probably can’t. In the latest ISI citizenship report, 51 percent of the country couldn’t pass the basic civic literacy examination required of incoming citizens. Not only are Americans not qualified to be voters, but apparently most of them aren’t even qualified to be Americans. America’s failings as a democracy don’t end there because in addition to being shockingly uninformed, the average citizen doesn’t even show up to vote. Attendance for House and Senate elections is appalling, with voter turnout for congressional races at its lowest point since 1942. The trend toward lethargy in national elections is just as pronounced. In the 1880 presidential election between James Garfield and Winfield Hancock, voter turnout was nearly 80 percent, and the single biggest issue in that race was the partial demonetization of silver. The most recent presidential election centered around some of the most pressing and vital political issues the country has faced in recent history: rallying after a recession, the budget deficit, a potentially nuclear Iran, the Affordable Care Act, and two full-scale land wars. Voter turnout barely broke 50 percent and the youth turnout was about 10 points lower. Demonetizing silver not being much of a bodice-ripper when compared to the threat of a nuclear winter, American voter engagement seems to have slumped somewhat since its heyday. Voters are completely disengaged from the political process and have abdicated their responsibility as citizens in a democracy. Statistics suggest that Americans don’t know the first thing about the country they live in or the policies they support, yet they are entrusted with electing the most important governing body in the world. In a decade of historic importance, turnout is at an equally historic low. Fear, ignorance, and misinformation dominate a political arena bereft of reason and intellect because the voting public can’t be trusted to read up on the issues or cast a ballot. A return to the monarchy probably isn’t in the cards, but when faced with an electorate that could seemingly only be drawn to the voting booth in the event of an alien invasion, leadership by heredity doesn’t seem like such an awful alternative.

		"title": "A Coachable Moment: Bringing Transparency to Campus Sexual Misconduct",
		"date": "2016-09-01",
		"authors": "by Emma Solomon, Opinion Editor",
		"content": "The classic phrase of coaches from Little League dads to Bill Belichick is “We have a target on our back.” Usually, this line is meant to both incite grandiose notions of stardom while also excusing a potential loss as the result of other teams specifically gunning for them. Recently, this sports cliché has taken on additional meaning in collegiate athlete settings; not only does the proverbial bullseye rest on individual teams, but it is now supposedly placed on men’s college sports as an institution. The notion of the target on the back has become reappropriated by schools, athletes, and coaches alike as an explanation for the link that has been drawn between sexual assaults (both allegations and convictions) and male collegiate athletes. I know of many coaches who have met their significant other through college athletics, and perhaps this leads to a shared idea that intra-team fraternizing will inevitably lead to long-term and healthy relationships. Alas, as both NARPs and athletes know, postgame celebrity and congratulatory drinking does not a lasting courtship make.  I am proud to be friends with many respectful, intelligent, and hugely talented athletes at the University. I was also one of two female members of the men’s varsity rowing team, which has allowed me significant insight and a distinct perspective into the complex inner workings of a varsity-level team. Additionally, my long-term boyfriend plays soccer at a different Little Three school, and his recounting of experiences offers an additional resource and ethos. I do not believe that sports are inherently bad, or make people so, and I remain somewhat skeptical that a so-called “male athletic culture” is solely responsible for the actions of all male athletes.    Although being a liberal arts institution, and a notably progressive one at that, does not by any means exempt us from harmful cultural attitudes toward women and sex, I recognize that our liberal bubble offers valuable protection from a relatively harsher global atmosphere. While most University students at least recognize that sexual assault in any form is horrible and indicative of underlying systemic issues, the current prevention strategies and post-trauma training continue to be discussed under the thick cover of euphemisms and a thin veil of discomfort.  A good coach is one that is invested in fitness and finesse and final scores; a great coach is one who cares about the game, the squad, but most importantly about the individuals that actually make up their team. At the very least, a college coach should be not only a leader, but also an observant and relevant presence, both on and off the field. Each year, both the head coach and student-athlete must sign the University’s Department of Physical Education and Athletics Athlete Contract Form, which states its mission as the following: “Along with the opportunity to participate in athletics it is the student’s responsibility to conduct oneself in a manner that supports the team’s goals and behave in a manner that will reflect well on your team, your coach and Wesleyan.” This contract details the promises of the athlete to refrain from violating policies relating to everything from alcohol and drugs to hazing to social media presentation.  Additionally, in signing this contract, the student-athlete waives the right to privacy with respect to their grades, agreeing to “allow my coach to have access to my academic records so he/she can accurately discuss my performance with me.” The publicity of a student’s college grades is an unsurprisingly contentious issue, and the most recent regulations outlined by The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) have purposefully and strictly denied guardians (tuition-paying or not) access to their child’s academic records. A concerned parent may wonder why their little Jimmy has racked up so many charges at “Forest City” while demonstrating zero interest or proof of Environmental Science engagement, but no amount of panicked calls to President Michael Roth himself will allow them to see his grades and courses. Yet, for a coach who wants to know whether a top scorer needs a little…tutoring…in Intro Econ, he can easily access current course grades. In addition to their access to personal academic information, coaches are made aware of various other highly private issues such as medical conditions, family emergencies, or other significant personal issues that may require skipping practice. There is nothing inherently wrong with coaches seeing their players’ grades (athletes are often reminded that they are called student-athletes and not athlete-students for a reason) or being privy to other exclusive knowledge, and I mention it only to highlight the clear discrepancy in information availability.  A more morally comprehensive and socially respectable contract for student-athletes would explicitly grant permission for coaches to be alerted when an athlete has formally had a sexual misconduct charge filed against them. An alert would simply notify, without judgment or accusal, a relevant adult figures that someone under their jurisdiction may or may not have committed anything from online harassment to multiple-assailant rape.  Given awareness of this information, a coach may choose to look skeptically but silently at the accused student: A subsequent “family emergency” that is suddenly requiring them to miss practices may be viewed from a coach’s more informed perspective. Instead, the coach may take the opportunity to have a discussion with the team about issues relating to sex and relationships. Predictably, some coaches will take no conscious action at all, but their ears may unintentionally perk up and be more attuned to the hushed conversations occurring between drills or at the back of the bus. Informed coaches may be inspired to nominate and encourage team leaders who talk respectfully about their girlfriends and/or female friends in general and may discipline the guys who recall a win by discussing how they “raped Midd last year.” In the current college climate, the only thing worse than an over-controlling coach is a lazy one who believes that his players’ actions off the field are beyond their pay grade or goal-oriented expertise.  A foreseeable counterargument from the athletic community might inappropriately utilize anti-death penalty or anti-mandatory minimum rhetoric and discuss the repercussions that may arise from potentially false allegations. Unlike the death penalty or jail sentences—which, among other issues, are disproportionately applied to men and women of color—however, alerting a coach that a member of the team is the alleged perpetrator in an active investigation with the Title IX office offers little to none of the irreversibility factor implicit in jail time or lethal injection.  From a player/coach standpoint, the worst-case scenario potentially arising from this alert system would be that a falsely accused athlete suffers from increased speculation by a coach. In consideration of this demographic’s deserved reputation vis-à-vis sexual misconduct, a coach’s increased attention might be far from harmful. Roxane Gay, in her acclaimed book “Bad Feminist,” offers a wise perspective on the false accusation issue (or really lack thereof): “I give the victim the benefit of the doubt when it comes to allegations of rape and sexual abuse. I choose to err on that side of caution. This does not mean I am unsympathetic of the wrongly accused, but if there are sides to be chosen, I am on the side of the victim.” Furthermore, even if every player on every sports team was falsely accused (an extreme and statistically improbable hypothetical), a greater focus on sexual crimes amongst coaches might act as a needed panoptic reminder for student-athletes. At worst, these hypothetical players might gain valuable insight into the investigation process and be further deterred from engaging in any sort of behavior that would again land them in the midst of a process designed to protect women from a violent culture that sports heroes have perpetuated and celebrated.   If coaches want to take pride in their team’s achievements, they need to step up to the plate and start taking responsibility for the other actions of those same valuable students. If they’re going to spend six days a week yelling about “crushing the back end” or “stealing third base” or “just because there’s a goalie doesn’t mean you can’t score,” then they also need to start speaking up a lot louder and a little less euphemistically about sexual responsibility."

		"title": "New Muslim Chaplain Hopes to Increase Interfaith Relations and Awareness of Islam",
		"date": "2016-09-15",
		"authors": "by Natasha Nurjadin, News Editor",
		"content": "Following the departure of Kaiser Aslam, the University has hired Sami Abdul Aziz as the new University Muslim Chaplain. Also known as Imam Sami, he began working at the University in August and hopes to focus and create events dealing with issues of Islamophobia and interfaith relations between different religions. As chaplain, his role is to facilitate religious services on campus, as well as provide pastoral counseling to all students, regardless of religious beliefs. “If somebody on campus is of another faith, doesn’t matter which, I’m also there to listen to them,” Aziz said. Aziz emphasizes that although he focuses on Muslim events, everyone is invited to all events, including weekly Friday prayers and support groups. The support groups are created for Muslim students to have a safe space and to interact with one another. Speaking to the political climate in the country with respect to Islam, Aziz highlighted the importance of openness in the campus community. “Being a Muslim in America can be difficult right now, [as] we are minorities not only in religious group, but also a minority group in the color of our skin,” Aziz said. “There is a lot of fear in the Muslim community regarding the political situation, [such as] what is going to happen. Is Islamophobia going to increase, and are people going to judge us based on our religion? There is some of that fear here among students on campus, and I want to help them be comfortable and let them know that this campus is open to you.” As Aziz works only part time at the University, he discussed his efforts throughout Connecticut in spreading awareness of Islam as a whole. He is the founder and CEO of the Common Grounds Services Institute. Through the institute, he travels to churches, libraries, and schools, educating members of these institutions on a variety of topics, including ISIS, Islamophobia, and women in Islam. He has also hosted joint services in churches, giving talks on the relationship between Islam and Jesus Christ. Aziz hopes to host an event at the University on the difference between ISIS and Islam. Interfaith relations are also something on which Aziz focuses, as he works with the on-campus Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish leaders in hosting interfaith events and exploring ways that they can work together. Aziz is also a member of the Bloomfield Interfaith Council. “I would like to see more interfaith collaboration events, maybe we talk about our faiths and what’s similar,” Aziz said. “The similarities are amazing between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. We have so many things in common that we don’t have an excuse to divide ourselves, in my opinion.” As Monday was Eid Al-Adha, a sacred Muslim holiday, Aziz has already hosted six events on campus. He hopes to also create a Muslim film series and bring in more Muslim singers and theater performances. Aziz is also working with Bon Appétit, the campus food service provider, in developing meals during Muslim religious holidays. Currently, Bon Appétit has special meals during other religious holidays, but not during Muslim ones. Aziz, who has also worked as a prison and hospital chaplain, noted that his time at the University has been enjoyable not just because of the campus environment, but also the welcoming atmosphere he has encountered. “For the first two weeks, I would walk around campus and not say who I was and people would think I’m a student,” Aziz said. “It showed me that people are willing to talk to me regardless of my beard or skin color. They would approach me. That was a nice feeling.” Aziz joins the line of Muslim chaplains who have served the University in one of the oldest Muslim chaplain programs in America. “I would say 80 percent of college campuses don’t have a Muslim chaplain,” Aziz said. “It’s been many years, probably a decade. I really appreciate that.” He also noted that he appreciated how the University provides budgeting for events. Aziz connected his experiences as chaplain now to how he felt in college and high school and how he used to be shy about practicing his religion openly. “Maybe some students don’t feel as open about their religion on campus, but I want them to know that no one is going to judge you. They should have the right, and Wesleyan does give you that right to be open,” Aziz said. “I want to provide more programming to make the Muslim kids feel more comfortable.” John Hossain, a graduate student at the University, admires Aziz for his engagement with students. “I’ve found the new Muslim Chaplain, Imam Sami, to be deeply invested in his students,” Hossain wrote in an email to The Argus. “He’s put significant effort into reinvigorating Muslim life on campus, for both practicing and non-practicing students, and providing a close-knit and diverse community for us to support one another. I’m hoping he builds momentum with this over the next couple of years and increases the visibility of Muslims at Wes.” Alicia Strong ’18, President of the Muslim Student Association, also discussed her confidence in working with Aziz in the upcoming school year. She had also previously collaborated with him in the wider Connecticut community. “He is very friendly and genuine and I know he’ll be able to reach Muslim students of varying religiosity,” Strong wrote in an email to The Argus. “I know him from my work in the Connecticut Muslim community and he is incredibly motivated. I’m particularly fond of his work educating people about Islam and his interfaith work. Hopefully the Muslim Student Association can have a bigger presence on campus with his help.”"

		"title": "University Releases Annual Sexual Violence Report and Next Steps for Equity and Inclusion",
		"date": "2016-09-19",
		"authors": "by Camille De Beus, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "The University’s Annual Sexual Violence Report and Next Steps for Equity and Inclusion was released in a campus-wide email on Friday, Sept. 16. Written by Vice President for Equity & Inclusion/Title IX Officer Antonio Farias, the annual update discussed the 2015 sexual assault report and continued measures to prevent sexual assault; the formation of a new Equity & Inclusion Steering Committee; and a new program to increase faculty and staff diversity. “The next steps to promote equity and prevent sexual assault include infusing that language and information into as many conversations as possible,” Farias wrote in an email to The Argus. “Critical to preventing all forms of sexual misconduct including harassment, stalking, intimate partner violence, and sexual assault is continued conversation and preventative education.” Although there was a decrease in reports of sexual violence at the University in 2015, there has been an increase in the number of initiatives to prevent sexual violence. “In addition to the online Haven program for all incoming students, we are working to have as many students participate in Bystander Intervention as possible,” Farias wrote. “The Residence Life staff have been provided more resources than in the past in terms of both training and passive education to expand the conversation to include consent and communication as well as healthy relationships. WSA is currently implementing the No Red Zone campaign, which we applaud and with whom we will be working in partnership.” Farias expressed concern over the decreased reports of sexual violence over the last year. “It takes significant time to change the societal culture we are a part of,” Farias wrote. “While seemingly counterintuitive, increased numbers are a positive sign that the climate for survivors is getting better as they feel supported enough to come forward and seek services as well as adjudication of their cases.” President Michael Roth agreed with Farias’s sentiment regarding fewer sexual assaults reported. “We see this in many schools around the country, some schools have no sexual assault, or so they say, which just means nobody’s reporting,” Roth said. “So there’s no comfort in having high reports, or high numbers, or high incidents. It’s good that people feel they can report, but it’s terrible that incidents are taking place. We continue to work with student groups that tell us how we need to a better job supporting people who have been assaulted, who’ve reported assaults. We continue to get advice about how we can have a more equitable procedure that finds people who are responsible, that deals with them appropriately, and also finds that some people aren’t responsible, people who have been accused. And then last is to raise awareness and create programs like the Bystander Intervention Program and others that reduce the likelihood of assault taking place.” Another way in which the University is hoping to improve processes and procedures for sexual violence survivors is by ensuring that everyone has access to information for reporting and support services; helping survivors connect to support and resources without speaking to multiple people; and having a faculty and staff that know how to respond to information related to sexual misconduct. “Constructive criticism is key to improving support at the same time we continue to shift a societal culture of disrespect and violence,” Farias wrote. “If you find yourself not thinking about how sexual violence has an impact on your life—that, dear Wesleyan community member, is your starting point—get educated and use that incredible brain and empathic heart to understand how your ‘out of sight, out of mind’ attitude contributes to the problem and more importantly, how you are the potential embodiment of the solution.” According to Roth, the University also signed an accord with some groups in Middletown to make it easier to work with the criminal justice system when sexual assaults take place. “Many students choose not to go to the criminal justice system because it can be a very challenging path on top of the awfulness of the event itself,” Roth said. “I’d like to see students who feel that that’s the appropriate path, to have the University’s support to do that with confidence and support. I don’t know there’s really more we can do, but just to make sure people are aware of the choices that they have. So in cases of rape, we can expel the student, but the criminal justice system can put that person in jail. In cases of rape, I’d like to see that person in jail, but that is up to the survivor of the assault, and we are conscious of the fact that it is up to that person if she or he wants to go ahead. Raising awareness of the issues so that students who are not directly involved in the incident can play a positive role in decreasing the likelihood of incidents taking place. Whether that’s men, women, everybody can play a role in stopping assaults from happening.” Additionally, the update described the new Equity & Inclusion Steering Committee that will be building on the work of the Equity Task Force. “The steering committee will review last semesters work, take in continual feedback from students, faculty, and staff, and begin the process of developing a timely work flow designed to address short, medium, and long term challenges to making Wesleyan a more equitable and inclusive educational environment for all,” Farias wrote. The Steering Committee will consist of the Vice President for Equity & Inclusion, the faculty vice chair, the WSA president, and the chair of the Board of Trustees Campus Affairs Committee. The committee is currently looking for volunteers to work with them. “We set up a Google form that lets the Wesleyan community members volunteer in areas where they feel they are best able to contribute,” Farias wrote. “No one on this campus has the luxury of loads of free time, so we’re asking you to prioritize your choices as I believe sweat equity is the catalyst for sustained change. So if you’re committed to change, step up and sign-up now.” The University is also implementing a new program for opportunity hires that will help increase faculty and staff diversity. “The Office for Equity & Inclusion is collaborating with both Human Resources and Academic Affairs to look at increasing the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce,” Farias wrote. “Part of this collaboration includes review of current practices, revision of these practices as needed, listening to ideas from current faculty and staff, and brainstorming new and innovative ways of outreach for each search process. Institutionally, we’ve begun to see successful changes in faculty hiring over the past few years, and that’s just the start of a long-term process of seeking, developing, and mentoring our increasingly diverse workforce.” Though there is still much progress to be made surrounding sexual assault and discrimination, Farias is pleased by the members of the University community who are working to help end sexual assault and discrimination. “If I’m pleased with anything, it’s with the relentless energy and activism around the elimination of sexual violence and identity-based discrimination that shows up in the overwhelming volunteerism of students, staff and faculty who serve on the Title IX Policy, Education, Core, Athletics, Student committees,” Farias wrote. “I’m also pleased with the WSA starting the year with the [No] Red Zone project. The reason we went with One Policy toward all forms of identity-based discrimination is because we want to see this level of engagement manifest to eliminate all forms of discrimination. My hope and the work I plan on for the coming year has to do with engaging in reparative work across all our communities, and encouraging the ‘generosity of spirit,’ that is one of our core values and should be our guiding beacon through whatever storms we encounter.”"

		"title": "Trustees Convene in Official and Private Meetings",
		"date": "2016-09-26",
		"authors": "by Jake Lahut, Features Editor",
		"content": "The Argus was told to direct all communication with The Board through the president's office while trustees met with students and faculty over the weekend. c/o Joe Mabel The University’s board of trustees convened over the weekend amongst each other and student representatives in break-out sessions available only to a select group of invited student and faculty representatives. A relatively unknown body to most students, the board has wide-reaching powers beyond any administrators, and even the president himself, and is endowed by the University’s charter. The Argus was unable to speak with trustees over the weekend because their meetings were private events, according to Lisa LaPlant, Executive Assistant to the Chief of Staff, who told The Argus that all communication with members of the board must go through the President’s Office. Specifically, requests were to be made to William Holder, Director of University Communications. The University’s Manager of Media and Public Relations, Lauren Rubenstein, is currently on maternity leave. Rubenstein is normally South College’s liaison with The Argus, and there is currently no interim replacement for her title within University Communications. Holder did not respond to multiple emails requesting media availability with trustees over the weekend. The selection of which trustees would be allowed to speak with The Argus was left to Holder’s discretion, though some suggested preferences were included in an initial email. Requests for interviews with selected trustees were made just before 6:30 p.m. on Saturday outside of a board event in the Career Center, where LaPlant directed The Argus’s requests to Holder after forbidding entry to the event. Requests to Holder, following LaPlant’s suggestion, were made via email at 6:33 p.m. Holder responded 38 hours later on Monday morning in an email to The Argus. “It’s not feasible to arrange interviews with trustees on the spur of the moment,” Holder wrote. “We can talk more about this, but in the meantime, if you have specific questions about the trustee meeting this weekend, send them to me and I’ll see what I can do.” Follow up questions on when the latest report on the Board of Trustees’ decisions will be released and why all communication with trustees must go through the President’s office were not answered as of this article’s publication late Monday evening. Because the requests for press availability were made on short-notice—and out of respect for LaPlant’s requests and orders—The Argus has not attempted to contact trustees in person, by phone, nor via email since speaking with LaPlant. Outside of their official meeting, trustees engaged in several break-out sessions with members of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) and attended private events with invited members of the University community. Members of the WSA were able to speak with trustees about student concerns, including the Resource Center suggested by the Is This Why movement, social spaces on campus, and general education requirements, according to Nila Ravi ’18, Vice President of the WSA. “The board thinks more long-term than President Roth or members of the cabinet do,” Ravi said. Because of that focus, Ravi sees the WSA and its members’ engagement with the board as crucial to informing them of current student needs so that they can make better long-term decisions. “[Our suggestions] were mostly what a lot of students need on campus right now instead of in, [say], 50 years,” she said. Much of this dialogue between student representatives and board members occurred during the Board Retreat, where ideas for the University’s future were exchanged. “The Board Retreat was just an introduction in setting the tone for this upcoming school year and what the Board wants to focus on,” Ravi said. “So there were a lot of full-board sessions that talked about Wesleyan more broadly and plans for the future. And then there were some dinners and games for the board to interact with members of Roth’s cabinet and things like that.” Ravi participated in several sessions along with other members of the Wesleyan community outside of the WSA. “The student reps were there for all of the board sessions, and there were faculty reps as well,” she said. “The only part we weren’t allowed to be at was a closed board session with President Roth, and then there’s a separate session with just the board of trustees.” According to the University’s charter—which was last amended in 2003—the President of the University must be one of the 29 to 33 members of the board, where Roth currently serves alongside his duties in South College. Ravi had a positive experience in her interactions with trustees. She found them receptive to collaboration with WSA representatives. “It was pretty good,” she said. “The board members that I interacted with were really open to student input, and we tried to come up with different things that I think were relevant to students right now. We’ll be writing a report of that in the near future.” Members of the board come from a wide range of professions and ages, with the Wesleyan experience tying them all together. From Kennedy Odede ’12—the youngest trustee who has garnered worldwide acclaim for his community organizing in Africa after coming to the University from Kibera, the largest urban slum in Kenya—to mainstay campus names like Adam Usdan ’83 and Andrew Brandon Gordon ’86, members of the board bring disparate experiences back to Middletown in an effort to preserve and improve elements like the campus culture and academic prowess. The board also has significant logistical burdens, such as electing the President of the University and determining the salaries of faculty members, according to the University’s charter. The board also has the power to determine and revise the University’s courses of study, along with its disciplinary procedures. The only mandatory meeting time for the board, according to the charter, is within 10 days of commencement. All other meetings are to be called by the Chair of the Board, Donna Morea ’76. Besides the President of the University, only trustees emeriti and the Chair of the Alumni Association or their delegate may be present for official board meetings. The charter also includes a section pertaining exclusively to conflicts of interest. If a potential conflict arises, trustees must disclose it to the board, and their vote may not be counted in the quorum of the meeting, though they are allowed to make their opinion on the matter known. The board was most recently reported to have voted to increase tuition and residential comprehensive fees by 3.3 percent for the 2016-17 academic year, according to a University blog post by Rubenstein. Tuition was set at $50,312 for all undergraduates, with room and board set at $13,950 for first-years and sophomores and $15,858 for juniors and seniors. Rubenstein contextualized the Board’s decision to raise tuition above the national CPI average for inflation as of the Feb. 27 meeting. “In order to continue supporting financial aid, as well to invest in high-quality faculty and innovative pedagogy and programs, the Board has adopted an increase modestly above the current inflation rate, and in line with our peers,” Rubenstein wrote. “As always, Wesleyan will meet the full demonstrated financial need of all admitted students. Recent initiatives have eliminated loans for our neediest students and lowered overall student debt to levels far below the national average.” The board’s most recent decisions, along with the WSA’s report on the Board Retreat, will be announced in the near future, though no firm dates have been publicly released."

		"title": "Students Look to Vote Amid Low Turnout",
		"date": "2016-10-03",
		"authors": "by Ariel Adler, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "In less than 40 days, Americans will elect the next President of the United States. However, if past presidential elections are any indication, roughly 42 to 46 percent of eligible voters will not show up to vote on Election Day. Pew Research Center conducted a poll in 2012 showing that only 129.1 million of 241 million eligible voters cast their ballots when President Obama was re-elected, and the numbers have not varied significantly within the past 50 years, nor are they expected to change this election. Comparatively, approximately 54 to 58 percent of Americans who are eligible to vote (i.e. 18 and up, not convicted of a felony, etc.) will elect the next President of the United States. Only 38 percent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 cast their ballots in 2012, according to census data. This group of voters, known as “Millennials” or “Generation Y,” has the lowest voter turnout among all age groups, including Generation X, Baby Boomers, and The Silent Generation. Even so, low voter turnout is not a rare phenomenon for young voters who, in 1964, peaked at 51 percent in voter participation. When asked why young people have such an abysmal voting record, Jack Warren ’20 spoke to a perceived futility in voting. “They feel like their vote doesn’t matter,” Warren said. “The electoral system is incredibly flawed…It’s very difficult to feel like your vote matters when you know that, no matter if you vote or not, your state’s going blue.” Oftentimes, the presidential election comes down to certain swing states like Florida and Ohio. For Warren, one vote may not decide the election, but each vote is important, especially if more and more people don’t vote. “If everyone adopted that mindset of ‘my vote doesn’t matter,’ then that wouldn’t be true,” he said. Co-Chair of the Wesleyan Democrats Simon Korn ’17 contends a similar argument. “Even if you don’t personally affect the outcome of the presidential election, or any election…you still should vote,” he said. “People who run for office spend lots of time and lots of money figuring out who votes, why they vote, and how best to represent you….If we as Millennials consistently vote in elections large and small, presidential, local, and state….People who run for office will take notice of that, and they will care about our interests.” In the 2012 presidential election, President Barack Obama received 67 percent of the youth vote, compared with Romney’s 30 percent, according to a study by Politico. In a study released days after President Obama secured his re-election, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University concluded the following: “If Governor Romney had won half of the youth vote, or if young voters had stayed home entirely, then Romney would have won instead of Obama.” Though the data itself includes figures from swing states like Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, it nevertheless articulates the influence the youth vote can have on presidential elections. Despite nearly 54 percent of the millennial voter population not voting in the 2012 presidential election, the percentage that did vote guaranteed Obama another four years in office. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump recognize how integral the youth vote is to the success of their individual campaigns. This is especially evident when comparing Clinton’s agenda before and after winning the Democratic nomination; she absorbed much of Bernie Sanders’ rhetoric on the economy and education, hoping to reproduce the enthusiasm millennials felt toward Sanders during his campaign. In fact, according to census data the the Pew Research center has analyzed, millennials are now a bigger voting force than any other generation, including the Baby Boomers. This means millennials could likely sway the vote in either Clinton or Trump’s favor. If those two options are unsatisfactory, Kati Young ’19 has an alternative. “This is an election where third-party candidates have had the strongest backing they’ve had in a long time, so if you’re interested in stopping the two-party system, then this might be a great opportunity,” she said. Young developed on the potentially monumental effect the youth vote can have on the presidential election. “Too many people have sacrificed to give me the privilege to vote for me not to vote,” she said. Young references, among other things, the fight for women’s suffrage, which ultimately led to the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, but her statement encompasses all groups whose voices, at one point or another, were silenced as a result of unjust laws, discrimination, and prejudice. Local and state elections, though often overlooked, play an equally important role in civic engagement. In an article written in The Washington Post on May 9, 2013, it was revealed that “Congressional approval averaged 15 percent, the lowest in nearly four decades of Gallup polling. And yet, 90 percent of House Members and 91 percent of Senators who sought re-election won last November. By 2014, the incumbency rate increased, while Congress’ approval rating decreased. This correlates with an article released by The Washington Post on Nov. 10, 2014 presenting statistics that showed “voter turnout for the 2014 midterms was the lowest it’s been in any election cycle since World War II.” Furthermore, outside the United States, in countries where leaders are not elected by the populace or where it is dangerous to vote, people are risking their lives to procure and uphold their right to vote. In the 2014 Afghanistan presidential election, approximately 7 million people voted despite recent attacks “carried out by Taliban militants,” including one on “the Afghanistan’s election commission headquarters,” according to a report by The Washington Post. Nonetheless, some argue that it is too difficult to register to vote, or that the process of filling out an absentee ballot is confusing and tedious. College students, who make up a large majority of the youth population, struggle to find time to register to vote in between classes and extracurricular activities. The requirements for filling out an absentee ballot vary from state to state, so it can be challenging to find information on a college campus pertaining specifically to one’s home state. Fortunately, Wesleyan offers ample resources to make the process as simple as possible. On the Wesleyan Office of the Registrar webpage, students can find under “General Information” links to information about registering to vote in the state of Connecticut, filling out an absentee ballot, and checking your voter registration status. If the information on the webpage is insufficient, Korn disclosed that the Wesleyan Democrats, in addition to collaborating with the Wesleyan Republicans on voter registration events both prior to and on Election Day, have found a possible solution to the anxiety that accompanies the absentee voting application process. “We’re going to have people in Usdan telling students how to vote in their home state,” Korn said. “People are going to come up to us, and we’re going to help them out individually one by one. That’s the only way to do it.” If none of that works, Korn strongly suggests turning toward the Internet. “Just Google ‘How to vote absentee in my state,’” Korn said. “What’s more, once you type ‘How to vote in my state’ in the search bar, Google automatically provides a template of information with step-by-step instructions explaining how to vote absentee. The same goes for when you type in ‘How to register to vote.’” Or, eligible voters can go to http://www.canivote.org/ and select their state, and the webpage leads directly to the state’s voter registration site where citizens can learn about deadlines and necessary documentation. “When it comes down to it, people have to make the decision on their own to vote and who to vote for,” Korn said."

		"title": "Breaking Out of the Bubble: A Look into the Gap Year of Sydney Taylor-Klaus ’20",
		"date": "2016-10-03",
		"authors": "by Nikhil Ghosh, Contributing Writer",
		"content": "c/o Sydney Taylor-Klaus Having spent almost a month at Wesleyan, the class of 2020 is quickly adjusting to the school climate and settling into the rhythm of balancing academics, extracurricular activities, and social events. As paper deadlines fly by and midterms approach, many students recall high school as the last time they had to take a test. Students who have taken gap years, however, have to look a bit further. Among them is Sydney Taylor-Klaus ’20. A 2015 graduate of The Paideia School in Atlanta, Ga., Taylor-Klaus spent the equivalent of two semesters traveling in New Zealand, Fiji, and Australia and volunteering on a permaculture farm in Nicaragua. The Argus sat down with Taylor-Klaus to hear about her experiences abroad, as well as her insights from the past year. When asked about her motivations for taking a gap year, Taylor-Klaus cited the need to separate her high school experience from college. “I wanted to break out of the routine of ‘school school school,’ and since college is really the beginning of the rest of your life, I wanted to take some time and figure out who I was before starting,” she explained. “I knew I could enter college more confident about who I am, but I also knew it was going to be a lot of work, so I decided to learn more about myself as a person.” More than five percent of Taylor-Klaus’s graduating class at The Paideia School opted to take a gap year, and she referenced her peers’ experiences as having helped her decision. “I knew as a freshman [in high school] that there were some students who took a year off and did really cool things,” Taylor-Klaus said. “During my junior year, my Ultimate [Frisbee] co-captain took a gap year, and I knew a lot of others who chose that path.” While Taylor-Klaus revealed her plans for a gap year to only a few of her classmates, she said she was pleased to receive their support. “Even though I didn’t talk about it a lot at school, when I finally told my friends about my plan, they were really supportive,” she said. “That was a really big help.” When planning out the finer points of her gap year, Taylor-Klaus searched for a cultural immersion trip that would take her abroad and engage her in community service. Opting not to take courses for credit, she signed up with Carpe Diem Education. Based in Portland, Ore., the company specializes in gap year programs and experiential education. Signing up for the Latitude Year program, Taylor-Klaus embarked on a 14-person, three-month trip to New Zealand, Fiji, and Australia. During the second semester of her gap year, Taylor-Klaus enrolled in a Focused Volunteer Placement (FVP) program, which allowed her to intern on a permaculture farm in Nicaragua through Project Bona Fide. “The essential project was applying permaculture principles to designing a piece of land for a hypothetical client,” she said. “We learned all about how these natural elements interact and about the strategies which promote sustainability and keep the Earth’s well-being as the first priority.” Discussing permaculture, Taylor-Klaus commented on the universal applications of the field. “It’s really a principle, or concept,” she said. “You can apply it to anything, like city planning, farming, or even which classes you take in college. For our purposes, we applied it to farming systems and structures, and agricultural design.” Taylor-Klaus also elaborated on how the study of permaculture opened her eyes to the cyclical processes of nature and how technology doesn’t have to work against or be at odds with the Earth’s natural balance. “Chickens are a great example,” she added. “They create manure that’s a great fertilizer for the soil and composting; they break down compost, produce eggs, food, and so much more. The food waste from the kitchen supports them, so you see the balance of elements supporting functions, and these functions supporting said elements. It’s multifunctional!” Balancing resources is another key concept that Taylor-Klaus learned and then utilized in her field work. “It’s a great way to use all of your natural resources, but not overtax them and have them run out,” she said. Though she had never previously considered working on a permaculture farm, Taylor-Klaus realized that her favorite portion of her New Zealand trip was working on an organic farm. Building water troughs, for example, helped her see more clearly the interconnectedness of nature. “While staying in a marae, or a Maori—an indigenous New Zealand population, that is—community, we toured another and saw how they planted native trees to rid surfaces of impacted soil and grass which caused a once-flowing river to become subterranean, and bring the river back over time,” she said. Taylor-Klaus was struck by the foresight of the Maori community and their determination to bring the Earth back to its true wealth of natural beauty. “My experiences on the group trip in New Zealand really helped determine where I would work during the FVP,” Taylor-Klaus said. “Because I had an affinity for manual labor and my interest in nature was there, my advisor strongly recommended the permaculture project. She recognized that it was a good fit, and I’m really glad that I ended up where I did.” Braving weeks of limited contact with her family and friends while thousands of miles from home, Taylor-Klaus truly embraced the hands-on approach to learning. “I’ve always known that I thrive on a mixture of classroom learning and hands-on engagement, and it was really something to go from one extreme to another, [and] for a year, at that,” she said. Self-care also became a major element of Taylor-Klaus’ gap year. “I learned so much about taking care of myself, and how to step back and take alone time,” she said. “I spent a lot of time sitting up in a mango tree, just reflecting and watching the natural beauty around me.” The immersive experiences, she maintains, helped open her up and observe the differences between various cultures. “When we got to Fiji, it was a first for a lot of people to not be in a First World country,” she said. “I could see my friends maturing around me, and though I didn’t realize it at the time, so was I. It was amazing to grow together, and so much of how I feel I grew is still inexplicable.” Skyping her family from Australia on Thanksgiving at 6 a.m., after weeks of no contact, provided Taylor-Klaus some positive feedback. “I remember that after the Skype [conversation], my family remarked on how happy, energetic, mature, and ‘me’ I sounded,” she said. “It’s not that I wasn’t ‘me’ before the trip, but I evolved, in a sense. It was truly incredible.” Having completed her first month at Wesleyan, Taylor-Klaus reflected on how her gap year has already influenced her University experience. “My gap year definitely made it easier to adjust, and I think that the confidence I gained by traveling made me much less scared,” she said. “I realized that if I could go to a Central American country by myself, without any knowledge of Spanish, and do well for myself, then I would be just fine in college.” The experience drastically broadened her horizons before coming to Wesleyan. “I really burst out of a bubble by leaving Atlanta,” Taylor-Klaus said. “Traveling the world, then coming to Wesleyan was bursting into an entirely new one, but the skills and self-knowledge I gained over the past year have stuck with me.” Comfortably reclined on a couch in the Clark basement lounge, Taylor-Klaus intoned that the past year has solidified her sense of self, while also strengthening her resolve. “I’m so much more at home in my own skin after the entire experience,” she said. “College was nothing to be scared of, and I’m now able to treat this as yet another adventure.”"

		"title": "Tensions Heighten in the Wake of Scott Backer Scandal",
		"date": "2016-10-07",
		"authors": "by Jenny Davis, Aaron Stagoff-Belfort, Gili Lipman, Jake Lahut, Editor-in-Chief, News Editors, Features Editor",
		"content": "Protestors hung posters on poles, windows, and walls across campus. c/o William Halliday, Photo Editor Before the Boston Globe article, before the calls for President Roth’s and Dean Farias’ resignations, and before the social media pandaemonium, there were only rumors. The lawsuit against former Associate Dean of Students Scott Backer and Vermont Academy has been in the public record since 2011, and two alumni claim that past students had been aware of Backer’s sexual misconduct. “The WSA executive committee and student affairs committee members seemed to know about Scott Backer’s firing at around that time,” a former WSA executive close to the matter said. “It was usually brought up in jest, to make fun of him behind closed doors.” According to the former WSA executive, students made jokes involving Backer’s texts with a 15-year-old student at Vermont Academy. Nothing, however, was reported to the administration. “I never reported it or really mentioned it because one, at the time, I thought it was just a rumor,” the WSA executive said. “Two, I thought it could also be a pair of WSA members in particular making shit up because Scott Backer sucks, and three, I figured the administration knew and didn’t care, or had investigated it somehow and came to the conclusion that they had nothing to worry about. In retrospect, I probably should’ve followed up, but I assumed that the Vermont Academy stuff was just a rumor and not verifiable.” Another former member of the WSA, who also wished to remain anonymous, also had suspicions about Backer, but did not follow through with official reporting to the administration. “I definitely had concerns at the time, some of them I raised, some of them I didn’t,” the former member said. “Now it’s too late. It is what it is.” The fallout from Backer’s recently revealed sexual misconduct by the Boston Globe has sent the University community into a tailspin of anger, grief, and confusion. Along with examining an additional court case involving Backer, The Argus spoke with current students, administrators, and alumni to shed light on the full repercussions of his concealed past.   “Everything Is Inherently Sullied” Hidden from students he interacted with throughout his nearly decade-long tenure at the University, Backer’s past has drawn forth raw emotions and troubling realizations after the fact for students who dealt with him in reporting sexual misconduct. Former Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) Intern Maggie Cohen ’12 brought a sexual assault case to the University through Backer. Finding out about his past at Vermont Academy re-opened a traumatic wound from her time on campus. “The unearthing of Scott’s past twisted the knife,” Cohen wrote in an email to The Argus. “It made me feel that my already fragile safety was nonexistent if the administrator responsible for adjudicating cases of sexual violence—not to mention other ethical infractions—was himself guilty of preying upon young people.” Cohen remembers her interactions with Backer as being unpleasant. “My interactions with Scott were strained and uncomfortable,” she said. “I knew that he was telling me he had my best interests in mind but that he represented Wesleyan and he wanted to keep any controversies to a minimum. Scott treated my case like it was routine.” Cohen, however, noted that the issues surrounding sexual assault at the University go far beyond Backer. “The lack of transparency goes beyond him & beyond President Roth,” she wrote. “The entire process has always been rigged, and I never knew what my rights were as a student coming forward to report sexual assault. In the year that I reported [2010-2011], Alysha Warren had not yet been hired, Tanya Purdy had not yet been hired, and the SART intern had only been a formal position for one year. The [previous] SART Intern was the only person who wholeheartedly supported me.” For Chloe Murtagh ’15, the recent Backer revelations put a cloud over the cases she was familiar with involving her friends, who she helped in the reporting process when working through the former dean. “He was the one handing out these moral judgments and verdicts, and he clearly had no standards of ethics and respect,” Murtagh said. “Everything is inherently sullied.” A student examines a poster detailing the Roth administration’s failures. c/o William Halliday, Photo Editor Elias v. Wesleyan University One of the most thoroughly documented examples of how Backer operated in sexual assault hearings is the federal lawsuit Elias v. Wesleyan. The case, which involves Backer as the adjudicator of a contested sexual assault ruling at the University, was recently settled out of court on Sept. 29, 2016 and calls into question Backer’s credibility in adjudicating sexual assault cases. The plaintiff, Scott Elias ’14, who served as the chair of the WSA’s Public Safety Advisory Committee and was a brother of Beta Theta Pi, was found guilty on two of three counts of sexual misconduct at the end of his senior year: one for sexual harassment, the other for sexual assault. The central argument of the Elias suit contends that Backer’s ruling on Elias’ sexual misconduct and its subsequent punishment—which allowed him to graduate but prevented him from attending senior week and commencement—was unfair and overly burdensome, mainly because of the political climate and controversy surrounding sexual assault at the University in 2014. In a text correspondence with Jane Doe 1, Elias was intoxicated and sent a flurry of disturbing messages. He wrote, “Don’t be that girl” after Doe didn’t reply to a text about meeting up while he was leaving the Beta Fraternity. After Jane Doe wrote, “you know we’re not hooking up, right?” at 12:48 a.m., some of Elias’ 14 unanswered texts in response were “I rally like you a lt,” “I kinda wana do dirty things to slut,” and “I Anna sleep with you babe.” Given the nature of his own case, Backer ironically dismissed the severity of Elias’ text messages. “Later that day, Plaintiff met with Dean Scott Backer who assured him that because Jane Doe’s allegations appeared to involve a ‘stupid drunken message a long time ago,’ which was an isolated occurrence as opposed to repeated behavior, it would not be ‘a serious Title IX concern,’’’ a court document states, quoting Backer. “Plaintiff left the meeting under the impression that he would be able to participate in the WSA meeting on April 20.” Upon reading the amended complaint available online, Murtagh argued why Backer was in no position to preside over sexual misconduct cases. “It’s stuff like that, that quote really illustrates how, even if we don’t dig up the fact that Scott Backer ever said some ridiculously fucked up thing…it’s just like this reality that, that’s [Backer’s] threshold of something that’s fucked up,” Murtaugh said. “If he doesn’t think that that’s fucked up, it’s very clear that the stuff we were reporting to him is fucked up.” Elias’ attorney, Kimberly Lau of Warshaw Burnstein LLP, has been a vocal opponent of many aspects of sexual assault adjudications writ large, such as: the definition of consent; assumptions about those accused in false reports, which account for somewhere between two and eight percent of all accusations according to a commonly cited study by UMass and Northeastern professors; and the methods behind sexual assault statistics themselves. In an article entitled “Is there a rape culture on college campuses?,” Lau, who is the piece’s main contributor, argues that the statistics surrounding sexual assault on college campuses, such as the proverbial “one in four” or “one in five,” are fundamentally flawed in methodology. For Lau, this flaw is connected to what she calls an “over inclusive” definition of consent. “The way the term is defined in the Survey is over inclusive and appears to be more the product of political and social agendas than what most people would consider ‘sexual assault,’” Lau said. The article further contends that the definition of “incapacitated” is too vague, advocating to void all assaults based on a lack of consent due to intoxication in the revised statistics. When asked if former Dean Backer’s credibility as an adjudicator would have been undermined given recent revelations about his personal past of sexual misconduct, Lau declined to comment when contacted less than a week after the settlement of the case. Because of the recent settlement, Lau said that she was unable to comment on any aspect of the suit. In defending Elias, Lau and Warshaw Burnstein focus extensively on the damages caused to the plaintiff, such as his loss of employment on Capitol Hill by a “prominent” member of congress, the loss of tuition, his future employment and graduate school prospects, and his deteriorating mental health. Elias’ legal team claims that the investigation, and mainly Backer’s judgment in the proceedings, ruined his post-graduate ambitions. “Plaintiff has not applied to any post-graduate institutions of higher education due to stress, depression, and anxiety associated with coping with Wesleyan’s wrongful findings,” Elias’ lawyers said in the plaintiff’s response to the University’s request for production of documents. Following graduation, Elias was employed as a staff assistant in 2014 for Congresswoman Ann Kuster (D) of New Hampshire’s second district. Elias left the team after just a couple of months in the summer of 2014 and complained that losing his position served as sufficient punishment. In Exhibit L of the court documents, Elias obfuscates his reason for departing, citing “personal reasons” rather than his exposure as a perpetrator. “I also interned and briefly served as a Staff Assistant on the House side before leaving for personal reasons earlier this summer and beginning a government affairs internship with the Solar Energy Industry Association this fall,” he said. Elias ended up applying to many prestigious companies, including APCO Worldwide, an independent global public affairs and strategic communications consultancy, and Group Gordon, a public relations and strategic communications firm. The chief claim of the employment section is that Backer’s verdict prevented Elias from finding employment. Despite this, just one month after resigning from his job as a staffer, Elias joined Solar Energy Industries Association as a business development associate in September 2014. He was promoted to membership development manager in July 2015. “Scott Elias has been with the Solar Energy Industries Association since 2014, where he operates at the intersection between renewable energy policy and renewable energy business development. Scott currently focuses on identifying and connecting solar industry thought leaders through membership development and strategic alliance opportunities that build the size and influence of the U.S. solar industry,” Elias’ current bio on his LinkedIn account reads. President Roth argued in his Sunday blog post that Backer’s authority in sexual assault investigations was checked by a multi-person process that struck the “appropriate balances.” Although he worked with other deans, mainly Dean Rick Culliton, it became clear in the Elias suit that Backer played an instrumental role at every level of the sexual assault reporting process. Backer was responsible for recording the entirety of the testimony and proceedings in Elias’ three cases. In addition, a photo of Elias and Jane Doe 1 at a formal was deemed “irrelevant and off limits” by Backer and the University during the course of the investigation, according to Exhibit M of the court documents. Backer also issued a no-contact order and restrictions on University facilities to Elias. This is included in Backer’s letter to Elias informing him of the University’s decision. Backer’s signature is on almost every document concerning Elias’ case in the suit, and he worked with all three of Elias’ accusers throughout the reporting process. In Elias’ account of the night, he claimed that there were no signs that Jane Doe was unable to consent to his sexual advances. “I assumed that she had also drank at least some alcohol, but I had no reason to believe that [redac] was in a state of drunkenness or intoxication because she seemed to have complete control of her balance, and did not speak to me with slurred speech,” Elias said. “[redac]’s steady gait on the walk towards the Butterfields tunnels and her verbal confirmation that she wanted to enter the Butterfields, continued to lead me to believe that she was not incapacitated in any way.” However, the Administrative Panel’s written judgment on the hearings, signed at the bottom by Scott Backer, found Elias guilty of violating the University’s sexual misconduct policy from 2010-2011. Overall, the panel found the details Jane Doe provided to be more persuasive than Elias’ account. Critical to the panel’s assessment was their belief that Elias had presented self-incriminating evidence, indicating in his written account that there was no verbal consent to repeated sexual contact. While the two parties in the case differed on the details on what happened in the Butterfields tunnels, the panel determined that there was enough overlap in the accounts to validate central elements of Jane Doe’s testimony. Elias seemingly called into question the reliability of his own account when describing his alcohol consumption that night and how it clouded his judgment. “The respondent also admittedly misread or misinterpreted nonverbal from the complainant which should have indicated the lack of consent,” the decision said. “Further, the panel found that the respondent’s aggressive engagement with the complainant did not allow for the acquisition of consent before the sexual contact commenced.” After Backer’s ruling on behalf of the University, Elias was given nine judicial points out of a maximum of ten between the two counts, and subsequently graduated despite being barred from commencement and senior week.   Responses: Administrative and Activist On Monday, Oct. 3, two days after the Globe article ran and one day after Roth published a blog post addressing Backer’s firing, Amy Mattox ’17 and Avigayl Sharp ’17 penned choice words from Roth’s post in Sharpie markers on their chests and left their shirts at home. Mattox ’17, left, and Sharp ’17, right, protest the administration’s response to Backer’s firing. c/o Jacob Karlin “Avigayl and I had been hanging out all day, fuming and not sure where to put that,” Mattox said. “We were talking about the importance of rendering pain visible. Everything kept coming back to the material reality of pain in the body, and the fact that those emails, which seemed so casual and so unimportant, and so symbolic of bureaucracy—sending a lot of emails—landed with a lot of pain….Avigayl and I both felt the need to exteriorize the pain in some way and make people who were going about their daily lives, knowing the information but really electing to suppress it, aware of the fact that this was landing in some sort of material, real way.” Mattox was particularly struck by the words “nothing amiss,” which Roth wrote in his blog post to discuss the findings of the Pepper Hamilton investigation; she wrote those words on her body, while Sharp penned “an abundance of caution.” “It was, like, the most absurd statement to read in the aftermath of eight years of this shit,” she said. “And then the whole apparatus of the administration not dealing with violence against students, and their own violence against students.” Nudity was vital to Mattox and Sharp’s protest. “There’s a direct analog of…the fact that the body is where sexual violence occurs, and the nude body is generally where it occurs,” Mattox said. “My body in particular, and Avigayl’s body, have been subject to that sort of violence, and it’s normally concealed for fear of shame and fear of people not caring….It’s also just a freaky thing to see people’s naked bodies….It’s something you’re supposed to keep at home, something you’re supposed to keep under your clothes. That tension is never going to go away.” Later that same afternoon, Roth sent a brief, campus-wide apology email (subject line: “An apology”), noting that he’d neglected to include one in his blog post and preliminary staffing update. Later that afternoon, The Argus asked him what he would say to survivors who were still upset in the wake of the information about Backer’s firing. “I think that dealing with the aftermath of sexual violence is hard enough, and the worst part of this episode with Scott Backer is that we are adding to the anguish that some of those people feel,” Roth said. “That’s one of the things I most regret about the current situation.” Roth reflected on his dismay at the news that Backer had been fired from his previous position for sexual misconduct. “The first thing I asked when we heard this—I was actually away; it was in the summer—was, ‘How did we hire this guy?’ and ‘How did we never hear?’” he said. “Well, of course we don’t do background checks once someone is on the job. And so should we have known? Well, in retrospect, yes, we should have known. Do I have an avenue where I think someone was negligent and not pursuing a reasonable report about this? I don’t. I have confidence in the Dean of Students office, that they would never have concealed this. In fact, once we heard this, Backer was immediately confronted and fired.” Paige Hutton ’18, though, was hardly appeased by Roth’s apology or his explanation. Finding fault with Roth’s decision to not inform students immediately after Backer’s firing, Hutton pointed out the administration’s apparent lack of attention to students’ needs. “They clearly didn’t see this as a big deal, or a big enough deal, and that happened in two different phases,” she said. “Years ago, when students were raising concerns about him, and they [the administration] didn’t listen, and now when Roth is saying, basically, that in this not telling it was clear that they didn’t think it was important enough to tell us. That, to me, is probably the worst thing.” Immediately after firing Backer, the Roth administration hired the Philadelphia law firm Pepper Hamilton to investigate his handling of sexual assault cases while at the University. Although the firm was criticized in a BuzzFeed article for being notoriously soft on administrators, as well as failing to consider student complaints of administrators in their review process, the firm’s report at Baylor University resulted in multiple firings and resignations, most notably with the school’s football coach and president. “We believe that they are best in class,” Roth said of Pepper Hamilton. “Of course, BuzzFeed, and other publications, perhaps, will say that they don’t always satisfy the students who bring the complaints. Well, that’s going to be true with any law firm; they don’t always satisfy people who bring these issues to the fore, because sometimes they don’t find what those people want. Not that they’re immune from criticism. They’re not perfect. But I don’t know that any other firm has a better reputation.” Besides, Roth continued, the University had sought the firm to identify issues with Backer’s performance. “We were not looking for a clean slate,” Roth said. “We were looking for problems, because if there were problems there, we wanted to fix them.” Sarah Chen Small ’18, however, wasn’t so sure. “The administration continues to set student needs as a last priority and then tells us that we’re too stupid to understand why this continual state of neglect and abuse is actually not that bad not the administration’s fault,” she wrote in an email to The Argus. “For example, Michael Roth said he didn’t take complaints [about Scott Backer] seriously or utilize them in the Pepper Hamilton review process because people only complain when a case doesn’t go their way, essentially throwing a tantrum. Last year not a single rapist was found guilty on this campus. So by basic logic and deduction, something this administration clearly lacks, complaints about Backer are not neutral, evenly distributable, or disposable. The people ‘complaining’ are majority female, of color, queer, trans, and low income. You cannot explain away the repeated harm the administration has done to these students.” More than just criticize Roth’s choice not to reveal the reasons for Backer’s firing, students have railed against the administration’s failure to address what they see as a flawed sexual assault policy. Much of Tuesday’s open town hall meeting focused on these perceived failures. “It’s consistently clear that the administration will always fail students as it’s set up right now,” Yael Horowitz ’17 said, who co-organized the town hall called “WhoRunsWes: an open town hall about community events.” “And it’s also pretty obvious that students really need to talk about this, and need to heal. The administration isn’t going to create those spaces for us, so if these spaces are going to happen, they’re going to have to be created by students.” Horowitz reflected on what she sees as a legacy of administrative failure, noting that it extends far beyond sexual assault policy. “I’ve seen the administration fail, always, like when [Vice President of Equity and Inclusion/Title IX Officer Antonio] Farias signed onto the letter about [defending free speech in] The Argus, and Farias’ actions in general of not supporting students of color, and Roth’s actions about sexual assault and about divestment and about a lot of issues on campus,” Horowitz said. “I think there’s been a ton of attempts to mobilize in the past around this, and there’s always another one. This is building off of that legacy.” In her eyes, the Backer scandal reveals skewed administrative priorities. “Right now, it’s clear that the administration and the school are concerned about continuing to make money and covering their asses in terms of liability, and they don’t care at all about survivors or victims or people who are underrepresented or experience microaggressions or anything like that,” she said. “They care about ‘fairness,’ but fairness is a coded word that doesn’t actually acknowledge the systemic power dynamics that are at play in most of these situations.” At the end of the over two-hour long town hall meeting, the group engaged in a blind consensus to decide on action items discussed throughout the night. Abby Cunniff ’17 felt heartened by the group’s cohesion. “I was hearing a lot of people really interested in investing in collectivism, and investing in prioritizing the needs of the student body in response to the administration clearly failing to do that routinely for the past four years,” she said. “I think that those two things were incredibly empowering for me to hear from other people, and I think that this is one of the highest levels of collective analysis that I’ve ever seen in a group, especially in a group of two hundred people.” Perhaps the most significant moment was the consensus to pursue measures to remove Roth and Farias from their posts. Hutton commented on that decision. “I think no matter who’s in charge, it would be roughly the same, but even just the image of Roth and Farias gone will encourage students to expect more of the next people,” Hutton said. “It’s unprecedented that two hundred people here called for the removal of the top two administrators at this school,” Henry Prine ’18 agreed immediately following the consensus. “In looking at the many failures of the admin, we are recognizing the overall trend of a detrimental lack of transparency, accountability, and leadership when dealing with situations. The way they dealt with the firing and investigation of Backer was only the latest iteration of this.” Another main point of action on which town hall meeting attendees focused was the lack of an advanced practice registered nurse, or an APRN, who has the ability to prescribe medication, on the Counseling and Psychological Services staff. “The fact that there’s not a psychiatrist in CAPS is craziness,” Hutton said. “I really think that that should have been their main priority from the beginning.” Despite the necessity of an APRN, this year’s Sexual Assault Response Team intern Lex Spirtes ’17 reiterated that when it comes to sexual assault, ad-hoc counseling is not enough. “I feel like the administrators bring you to CAPS, as if it’s an emotional issue rather than a policy one,” Spirtes said.“It may be an emotional issue as well, but I’ve been seeking emotional help, and you can’t just put me on CAPS to resolve this issue that has arisen because of policy issues that have nothing to do with my emotional stability.” In a Monday interview, Roth defended his administration’s sexual assault policies. “I do think that we have to ensure a fair procedure so that a person accused of sexual assault also feels that the procedures are fair, because it is possible that someone is accused who is not responsible,” he said. “So on the one hand, fairness and due process are important. On the other hand, supporting survivors and making sure that their complaints are held, or heard in a speedy and fair way is also important.” Roth also reiterated his commitment to protecting those who are vulnerable to abuse of power, as well as his deep regret about Backer’s tenure at the University. “I think that the abuse of power by men and by people in administrative and professorial positions is disgusting,” he said. “It’s unjust, and it is counter-educational. So finding ways to make sure that people who are vulnerable to those with power can defend themselves has been one of the most important things that I’ve tried to do. For this to happen on my watch is a terrible thing for the University, because I do think that fighting for more equality for women, and for LGBTQ students, and for minority students, is what I try to do every day.” Spirtes still has myriad issues with the administration’s handling of sexual assault cases, including her own. “I’m feeling frustrated,” she said. “I’m currently going through something with the administration right now. It’s about a sexual assault, and I’ve had to go to various parts of the administration, and I’ve been told, ‘Nothing can be done!’ I’m like, ‘Can nothing be done? Or are you just shrugging off my case?’” Spirtes further spoke to the ways that the wake of the Backer case opens up conversations about transparency. “They’re saying that conversations are happening that then I’m not included in, and I think people keep hiding behind policy instead of engaging with students and having these conversations,” she said. “At this point, in my situation at least, I feel like I’m at a loss with the administration and academic accommodations. I never interacted with Scott Backer myself, but it’s definitely stirring up these things. It’s terrible, and what happened with Scott Backer is terrible, but it’s part of a larger system in which Scott Backer, to some extent, is being able to be used as a scapegoat for other members of the administration, who are in smaller ways not helping survivors and defending perpetrators.” As for Scott Backer, his whereabouts are currently unknown."

		"title": "Why We Won’t Talk About War",
		"date": "2016-11-03",
		"authors": "by Jake Lahut, Features Editor",
		"content": "With less than a week to go until Election Day—and given the collective nausea surrounding the 2016 presidential campaign—it might be better to wait to stave off debate about how we ignore our perpetual wars. If anything, this article is intended more for the archives than it is for the proverbial “undecided voter” whose mind might miraculously change because of a vapid opinion piece in a college newspaper. Nonetheless, the fact that we continuously compartmentalize and ignore our military conflicts abroad is shameful. The arena of our second-longest war, Afghanistan, was only mentioned once in this year’s presidential debates. The Vietnam War, our longest war, was seared into the minds of baby boomers, 9.7 percent of whom were involved in the conflict. Two thirds of those who served in Vietnam enlisted voluntarily, dispelling the relatively popular myth that most Vietnam veterans were coerced into combat by the draft. Without the draft and a comparable feeling of civic duty, millennials and Gen Xers have served in the Gulf War and the War on Terror in far fewer numbers. Less than one half of one percent of Americans have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2.5 million who have served in the War on Terror have seen more combat than previous veterans because the military now outsources non-combat-related services to contractors. Depending on the year, close to 30 percent of defense spending has gone to independent contractors who do anything and everything from serving food to gathering intelligence, and even to fighting in combat. There has been a litany of articles in media publications and academic journals about the outsize influence of Private Military Contractors (PMCs) on the United States Department of Defense, most notably with Halliburton and its connections to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Less removed from the machine of the military industrial complex is the widespread problem of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among veterans, with the greatest concerns arising from an alarmingly high suicide rate. Over 20 veterans commit suicide each day. Veterans face a 21 percent higher risk of suicide than the rest of the American population. Though there have been mini documentary segments about this on just about every major nightly news program and on myriad alternative news outlets, the American public by and large ignores the suffering of veterans, at best compartmentalizing it, and, at worst, outright not caring about it. How this has happened is a complicated question. Academics like Byron Nichols, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Union College, have suggested that one turning point in the American public’s attitude toward wars and engagement with service members came when military parades ceased after the Vietnam War. Longer term trends include a lack of news coverage from arenas of war by foreign correspondents. With the exception of a few organizations, Vice, for example, most major news organizations have cut back on foreign correspondents. Yet, at some point, we have to stop blaming institutions and accept that we are the institutions that perpetuate what we don’t like in the world. Blackwater didn’t get its money out of nowhere; we elected the members of Congress and president that made those appropriations. The inadequacy of coverage for vets with PTSD didn’t happen on its own; we made the conscious choice to care more about other issues when electing our representatives who sat on the Veterans Affairs Committee. We’re the ones who condemn the moral atrocities of war by not even showing up at the ballot box when it counted. We are the generation that would rather spout off on social media than write a letter or make a phone call to our elected officials telling them why we’ll vote them out if they don’t stand up against a lack of funding for the VA. We are a generation that spends billions of dollars on contractors who swear allegiance not to the flag, but to the almighty dollar. Even closer to home, we can support our Posse Veterans, of whom now there are around 30 on campus. While they don’t expect us to frantically go around thanking them for their service everywhere they go, we can do simple things like listening to their different experiences and refrain from morally judging their past. How we treat veterans on campus is a direct extension of how we treat veterans in our society writ large, and on a campus this small, we can make much more of a difference than on most other fronts. Given that we are four days away from a potential Trump presidency—which is closer than ever to happening, based on the latest forecast from FiveThirtyEight—many of the problems we face now that already seem awful could quickly become absurdly abhorrent. Given this country’s compartmentalization of our global military presence, the conditions for the rise of a fascist tyrant are all the ripe. One public figure who has made a consistent effort to engage with the grave realities of our military is NBC’s Willie Geist, who frequently brings up casualties and PTSD on “Morning Joe” and tweets out the daily number of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rukmini Callimachi of The New York Times is perhaps the best terrorism reporter in the world, finding her way into the chatrooms of the Islamic State and following major players that most people outside of the intelligence community otherwise wouldn’t know about. So after Election Day, and hopefully after Donald Trump picks up his toys and goes home, let’s start talking about the most impactful and largest scale thing this country does: waging war. If we keep compartmentalizing and ignoring it, we cannot claim the moral high ground once we start paying attention. Lahut is a member of the class of 2017."

		"title": "Why We Must Talk to Trump Supporters",
		"date": "2016-11-10",
		"authors": "by Jake Lahut, Features Editor",
		"content": "After reading the scores of heartfelt Facebook statuses, calling my parents, venting to my housemates, and seeing my Facebook friends who have supported President-Elect Donald J. Trump—or suddenly revealed that they voted for him despite concealing their support publicly—I am compelled to plead for something that will be deeply unpopular on Wesleyan’s campus: Please talk to Trump supporters, especially before the President-Elect is inaugurated. This is far easier and more accessible for some among us, mainly the proverbial cis-gendered heterosexual white male. Because of safety concerns alone given the violence provoked and perpetuated at many Trump rallies, talking to Trump supporters is far more difficult for people whose identities have been openly attacked by their candidate, notably—but by no means limited to—the Latino, Middle Eastern and South Asian diasporas, as well as black and Jewish Americans who have seen a precipitous rise in overt racism and anti-Semitism brought out by many Trump supporters, especially members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. Nonetheless, those among us who are able, but potentially not yet willing, must step up and speak to some of the 50 million or so Americans who voted for a historically defined fascist, or at least someone who pretended to be to initially promote his brand and later win the presidency. I worked on a book about Donald Trump for Mark Singer of The New Yorker. In the final product, “Trump and Me,” Singer holds two lenses to the rise of the real estate mogul turned fascist demagogue: his experience writing a profile of The Donald in 1996 that took several months, and the research we could come up with together on just about everything the man had said in public life relating to political positions, insofar as he has positions. Though I have nowhere near the amount of expertise on Trump as someone like my boss or Trump’s ghostwriter would have, I gained a healthy dose of perspective on Trump’s ability to alter what he says based on the audience in front of him. For many people reading this, that audience has never been us. One of the shocking things I’ve come to realize in the last few days—and, as Trump would say, ‘believe me, folks,’ there have been plenty—is the fact that, much like the so-called Beltway Elite that got the election wrong, many of my friends and colleagues at Wesleyan do not know any Trump supporters personally. I do. Some are former teammates, others closer friends, and some are family members. This proximity to dissent is becoming increasingly lost on our generation as we perpetually self-select and enclose ourselves in social media and our institutions of choice. Perhaps the most influential Trump supporter I’ve known is my late Uncle Woods, my mother’s youngest brother who died suddenly over the summer. We constantly argued about politics, sometimes with pleasure, others with anger and disdain. Whatever our feelings were, however uncomfortable we felt, we never shut each other out (unless my mom told us to take a break for the sake of the rest of the extended family at dinner). The important thing about debating with my proverbial conservative uncle wasn’t that it humanized a Trump supporter, it’s that we were better off engaging and disagreeing than talking past each other and letting animosity fester. Many Trump supporters were once on our side. There are over 200 counties in this country that elected Barack Obama twice, yet voted for Trump on Tuesday. This is hard to square with the fact that much of the momentum behind Trump’s rise stems from the backlash to the election of the nation’s first black president. Despite all of the progress made during the Obama administration, over 900 democratic state legislators were defeated over the course of his two terms. I don’t know how to explain all of this coherently and convincingly. I’ll leave that to the tireless journalists and academics who sacrifice sleep and their cherished relationships just to figure these things out. All I have is a hope that engagement with our political opponents can fight off the toxicity and danger of an intramural scrimmage turning into a war between alternate realities. Though I may not have known how important these debates were until my uncle was gone, I believe more than ever that just about everyone would benefit from having someone in their inner circle to vigorously disagree with. I’m fully aware that it’s far easier for someone like me to make this argument than it is for the people I’ve mentioned above, but there has to be a limit to our safe spaces and social justice jargon when people’s lives are at stake. Places like Wesleyan can become breeding grounds for fascism despite our best intentions. We have bred Trump supporters here, one of whom wrote at length about his conversion in today’s New York Times. No matter how invigorating it may be to live on the frontier of the political left, our rhetoric and sheer lack of empathy—mostly those of us who are not under attack by Trump’s rhetoric—for those who don’t share our verbose jargon make us no different than those on the alt-right and in the Tea Party who spurred Trump’s rise in the first place, minus a dictionary worth of terms 98 percent of the population doesn’t understand. Talking to Trump supporters and checking our jargon at the door doesn’t mean that we have to absolve them for political views that invalidate human lives, nor does it make us complicit in the dialectic of the neoliberal patriarchy and the post-truth rise of fascism, or whatever else we’ll call it from our classrooms high above in the ivory tower. What talking to Trump supporters does do, however, is make them realize that the PC liberal elite they hate, the abject Other they hate, and whoever else they want to take their country back from, are complex human beings just like them. Engaging with those we vehemently disagree with also reveals something about our character. It shows that not only can we reciprocate the humanization we lend them, but that we can take Michelle Obama’s high road and resist matching their hatred and ignorance with our own. Most importantly, this is what a civic society is all about, and we cannot preserve or improve it on our own. When I think back to how I felt by my uncle’s side, I don’t fear the loss of the republic or the horrors of fascism. Instead, a ball begins to grow in my throat as I long for one more shot to be in that position to change his mind, and to question my own assumptions. While I can’t confidently argue that a justifiable amount of good will come out of this national catastrophe, I have to believe that there’s still something we can do to make a difference. It all starts with a face-to-face conversation, a raise of the eyebrows, a huff of frustration, and a handshake—or even a hug—at the end, followed by an “until next time,” where you’ll vigorously disagree and be better off for it all over again.

		"title": "New Bookstore to Open on Main St. this Spring, Broad St. Books Employees Blindsided",
		"date": "2016-12-01",
		"authors": "by Jake Lahut, Features Editor",
		"content": "c/o Northeast Collaborative Architects In preparation for the most financially significant unification of the University and the City of Middletown, President Michael Roth ’78, along with over a dozen Middletown dignitaries, announced the opening of a new campus bookstore, which will be run by R.J. Julia of Madison, Conn., on Main St. in a ribbon cutting ceremony on Wednesday, Nov. 30. The next day, rank and file employees of the current campus bookstore, Broad Street Books, were in disarray after being blindsided by the announcement. While employees were aware of a change in locations for the bookstore, most did not know that their parent company, Follett, had lost the bid for the Main St. location until they found out about it through the evening news, Shawn Beals’ story for The Hartford Courant, or the University Communications newsletter. “We don’t know if we’re keeping our jobs,” said a Broad Street Books employee who wished to speak under the condition of anonymity so that they could speak candidly. Several employees also cited a corporate policy that prevented them from speaking with the press. The University has made efforts in the past to let employees of companies whose contracts have ended continue working on campus with the next vendor, such as back in 2007 when many current Bon Appétit employees stayed over from Aramark, the previous campus dining vendor. However, these workers were all part of a union, Local 217, which was most recently covered in an Argus feature on Bon Appétit’s impending contract negotiations. At the ribbon cutting ceremony, R.J. Julia CEO and founder Roxanne Coady said that she is interested in employing Wesleyan students at the bookstore, and that the bookstore would look to hire 15 to 18 people upon opening in the spring of 2017. “Tell them to send us their applications!” Cody said at the ribbon cutting ceremony, referring to potential student employees. While several Broad Street Books employees expressed discontent and shock over the news that their parent company, Follett, had lost the bid to run the new bookstore, none of them were willing to speak on the record about the decision, citing a corporate policy. Several senior management level employees were absent the day after the ribbon cutting ceremony. Regional manager Bert Ramgren, who runs Broad Street Books for the Follett Corporation, did not comment after repeated requests from The Argus before the publication of this article. Follett Corporation communications officials also did not comment after repeated calls to the company’s headquarters in Westchester, IL. Spokesman Thomas Kline, who was unfamiliar with the Broad Street Books situation from his position in corporate headquarters, only suggested consultation with University administration. Director of University Communications Bill Holder told The Argus that Follett had been notified about the decision to go with R.J. Julia, though he did not know who specifically was contacted at Follett. R.J. Julia’s winning of the University’s bid for a new bookstore vendor is just one in a series of achievements for the Madison-based company, which has another location in the Hamptons on Long Island in addition to its original store and its soon-to-be third location in Middletown. “R.J. Julia hosts more than 300 events each year in Madison and has won several major awards,” a University press release given at the ribbon cutting ceremony read. “Among those are Publishers Weekly Bookseller of the Year, Lucile Pannell award for bookselling excellence, and Connecticut Magazine Best Bookstore.” Coady was impressed with the coordination required to pull off the project. “It is both rare and exciting to see a community come together the way Wesleyan, the City of Middletown, and the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce have,” Coady said. “Together we can create the kind of bookstore that will be the new standard for a college bookstore that is an integral, active member of its town.” Set to be completed before the end of the 2017 spring semester and ready for the 2017-18 academic year, the bookstore will boast an innovative yet historically preserved aesthetic in the 1930s art deco building that used to belong to Itkins Decorators. Northeast Collaborative Architects, the firm contracted by the school to design the new bookstore, created a two-level plan for the building that doubles its square footage from 6,000 square feet to 12,000 square feet. c/o Northeast Collaborative Architects Jeffrey Bianco, one of the firm’s partners, said he was particularly inspired by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, whose aesthetic was particularly concerned with the Gesamtkunstwerk, or Total Work of Art, whereby the design, not just the building, but the interior surfaces and furniture are all coordinated toward the same goal. “Alvar Aalto did a beautiful bookstore in Helsinki that I looked to,” Bianco said. “I’m an historical architect. The rule is, it’s who you steal from that counts. Everything’s already been done, and this is a high quality to steal from.” Featuring an open basement level and a ground floor with bookshelves winding around the parameter on the first floor, the architectural plan is held together by sleek glass panels and preserved metal columns. This look is similar to the newly renovated Boger Hall, which houses the Gordon Career Center, the Art History Department, and the College of Letters. The bookstore basement space will have room for over 100 spectators during book talks, plus onlookers from the next floor up. Coady plans to put on around four events per week at the bookstore, which should make it the go-to venue for visiting authors rather than traditional venues like Russell House and the Daniel Family Commons. At a time when most universities are scaling back their bookstores and retracting them toward campus, Wesleyan is moving ahead to establish an even larger bookstore on the busiest section of Main St. between Washington and Court streets. The added unity between the campus and the city has all parties involved hoping for the best, especially under a Roth administration that has made a greater effort to engage with Middletown than previous administrations. “President Roth’s engagement with the Middletown community has been outstanding,” said Larry McHugh, president of the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce. “Wesleyan makes Middletown a better community just because of their presence here, and their diversity and everything else that they add to us. As you can tell, I’m excited.” “We’re committed to strengthening the ties between campus and Main Street,” Roth said. “Relocating Wesleyan’s bookstore is a major step in the direction, and I am so delighted that R.J. Julia Booksellers, with their phenomenal reputation, will be our partner in this effort.” The hype behind the project has been building rapidly once the markups were released, especially among Middletown dignitaries who have been wanting more retail on Main St. for years. “The new Wesleyan bookstore will be a transformative development for downtown Middletown and for the city as a whole,” said Middletown Mayor Dan Drew. “We’re going to have the best college bookstore in the country,” McHugh said, pumping his fist adorned with a gold and garnet ring in his support for the venture."

		"title": "Students at University Participate in Nationwide Jewish Resistance Movement",
		"date": "2016-12-01",
		"authors": "by Camille De Beus, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "c/o Jonas Powell, Photo Editor Jewish students and others at the University came together on Wednesday, Nov. 30, demonstrating on Andrus Field in a Day of Jewish Resistance. The event was part of a nationwide effort to draw the line against the appointment of Steve Bannon and the normalization of hate and violence, among other calls to action. The University was one of over 30 communities in the country that participated in the Jewish social justice organization IfNotNow’s national day of action. “For too long, our Jewish institutions have spent the majority of their political capital on ensuring that the American government supports Israel unilaterally,” a statement from IfNotNow read. “Now, that stance threatens to make them complicit with newly-emboldened white nationalists that swept Trump to power on the back of anti-Semitic tropes. Bannon, Trump and their ilk are relying on our silence as they quietly normalize the sort of hate that characterized the Trump Campaign.” Students who participated gathered at 12:15 p.m. in Boger Hall for a reflection and dialogue before taking action. At 12:45 p.m., they marched out to Andrus Field forming a line, singing two songs, and reading a statement adapted from IfNotNow’s script. “The talk was basically for framing the action and what was going to go down,” one of the students who helped coordinate the event, Anna Cohen ’17, said. “The reason why we thought that was important was because anything that goes around with Israel or Jewish identity politics in general can get really complicated. We didn’t want people to be participating in an action where they didn’t know what they were standing for.” Talia Kaplan ’18 spearheaded the University’s participation in this movement. “I remember being really energized when reading about the actions that IfNotNow held last week, calling for Bannon to be fired,” Kaplan wrote in an email to The Argus. “When I saw they were holding a National Day of Action to escalate the call and looking for lots of communities to step up, I immediately thought of Wesleyan. We’re fortunate to have a very social justice-oriented campus, and a good number of student activists also identify as Jewish.” Participating in this event was about more than the Jewish community drawing a line. In particular, the reflection served as a place for students to be critical about how the Jewish community could improve internally and externally. “Within our community we talked a little bit about how we haven’t been as queer friendly as we could have been, especially with Hillel and the whole Mosaic United movement that went around them,” Cohen said. “….Then outside of our community we talked about how there’s been a way in which Jews have benefited from a model minority stereotype. We haven’t spoken out enough for other groups, because we’re maintaining our position of privilege within the United States.” The movement faced some criticism. According to Ella Israeli ’17, who helped lead the event, many people wondered why it had taken the Jewish community this long to draw the line. “Why is it that a white supremacist has to be elected and put in place, or in Steve Bannon’s case a senior advisor?” Israeli said. “Why do we have to wait? Why are we drawing the line here? We should have been drawing the line a dozen years ago.” Israeli acknowledged that there are Jewish organizations that have been working toward drawing this line for a while, by helping with movements such as Black Lives Matter. “I think it’s important for the Wesleyan Jewish community to do this now, because now more than ever they can’t just be the same people who have been working,” Israeli said. “What is happening now is not normal, and we need as many people fighting against it as we can possibly get….Wesleyan is a campus that for better or worse, the nation looks to in certain instances….I do think it’s not just we need as many people as we can get; we can’t just turn away right now.” Yael Fisher ’18, who helped organize the event, echoed this sentiment. She also discussed the importance of bringing to light the importance of helping students see Judaism as part of their identity and a source for their activism. “A lot of us feel alienated by the fact that most Jewish engagement on this campus is tied to religiosity,” Fisher said. “It doesn’t have to be that way. Judaism is both a culture and a religion, and it has a longstanding tradition of social justice and of activism and being at the forefront of activist causes, including our own liberation.” However, the event brought in some new faces to the Jewish activist scene. Jacob Karlin ’17 helped plan the event, but had previously not been involved with the Jewish community at the University. “It was really nice to be in a room full of people who I’d never seen also talk about their Judaism,” Karlin said. “It was really cool just to see a bunch of people just dissecting the moment that we were currently in. It was just really exciting to see an energy surrounding this conversation, and I’m really excited to see where this goes.” Many of the students involved with Wednesday’s event are hoping that this is just the beginning of the Jewish Resistance movement at the University. “I both hope and anticipate that Jewish (and other) students at Wesleyan will continue to act on their values,” Kaplan wrote. “Judaism has a long tradition of social justice. For example, after marching with MLK, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel talked about how his feet were praying. My Jewish tradition compels me to pursue justice for all people, regardless of race, religion, or socioeconomic status.”"

		"title": "University Plans External Title IX Review",
		"date": "2017-02-02",
		"authors": "by Jenny Davis, Molly Schiff, Executive Editor and News Editor",
		"content": "The University has announced its plan to examine its Title IX policy as well as its adherence to the Violence Against Women Act in a two-day long series of meetings with members of the University and external reviewers from the Victim Rights Law Center (VRLC). In an all-campus email, Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias outlined the upcoming review by the Victim Rights Law Center (VRLC) in conjunction with the campus-based Title IX Student Advisory Committee, Title IX Policy Committee, and members of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA). The review will take place on Tuesday, Feb. 7 and Wednesday, Feb. 8. “Title IX is a multi-pronged process of continuous improvement, meaning there is end to the struggle for gender equity,” Farias wrote in an email to The Argus. “The Title IX external review Wesleyan conducted 4 years ago provided the Title IX committees with a functional road map of changes that needed to be done.” The VRLC is a nonprofit law organization with offices in Boston, Mass. and Portland, Ore., that serves survivors of sexual assault nationwide. Deputy Director Lindy Aldrich, Education Program Senior Attorney Amanda Walsh, and affiliated attorney Candi Smiley, who is also Title IX director at Howard University, will be coming to the University as members of the external review team. “Founded as the first law center in the nation dedicated solely to serving the legal needs of sexual assault victims, the VRLC is the leader in representing sexual assault victims within the civil context,” the group’s website reads. The organization was chosen in a collaborative process that began by communicating with Title IX coordinators at other universities to acquire names of reputable consultants. After narrowing the field to four contenders, the Student Advisory Committee and the Policy Committee debated and made the final recommendation for selection. Additional information on each reviewer as well as a schedule of events are available on the Office of Equity and Inclusion’s website. “We agreed on VRLC for a few reasons: their credibility with many campuses, their lens toward creating fair process as well as supporting survivors and their ability to provide a diverse team,” Farias wrote.  Equity Compliance Director and Deputy Title IX Coordinator Debbie Colucci outlined a few goals of the review, citing specifically the need to perpetually seek improvement in the University’s policies. “We have two primary goals.  First, we know what our policies and procedures are and we know how they have evolved over the past few years through the work of a number of committees of student/faculty/staff; what we hope to learn from this review is if the current policies and procedures are working for our community,” wrote Colucci in an email to The Argus. “The second goal is ideas; we are looking for feedback and best practices from the consultants in order to continually revise our processes.”  Nila Ravi ’18 and Kate Macken ’19 were the members of the WSA who co-chaired the Title IX advisory committee.  “They’re meeting with a wide range of groups on campus — administrators, faculty, and students — and hopefully they will be able to understand the pain points of the Title IX process from all of these important perspectives,” Ravi said. “Personally, I’m hoping to advocate for increasing accessibility to the process for all students. I have been working directly with the Title IX office for two years now to improve Wesleyan’s process and this has been a personal focus for me.”  In particular, there are three established issues the review will aim to address, as mentioned in Farias’ email: the lack of clarity of resources; accessibility of the process to all, including underrepresented populations of students, faculty, and staff; and the interaction between the Title IX Office and other first responders. These key weaknesses were brought to the attention of the University as a result of the attention hard work of all on campus working to better the community through improving its policies. Farias paid tribute to the efforts of this group in the years since the external review was undertaken. “I also want to note that the Title IX Committees, composed of faculty, staff, and student representatives, have been working these issues for the past three years non-stop; and the changes made are the direct result of engagement with all aspects of the campus community as well as on and off-campus support resources,” wrote Farias. “The external assessment of Title IX we are about to undergo is the next step in our continuous improvement ethos.” “The primary reason for the consulting group coming to Wesleyan, I believe, is to make the Title IX adjudication process and Title IX related resources accessible to all students who potentially want and need it,” Ravi said. “In recent years numbers have shown that fewer students have been utilizing the Title IX process as a resource. This, coupled with the circumstances surrounding the departure of Scott Backer, and the subsequent student activism calling for reform, were big reasons why the consulting group is coming as well.”"

Before Yale renamed a residential college that commemorated a staunch defender of slavery, before Wesleyan had an African American Studies Program, and before just about every student here was born, Black faculty, staff, and students took a stand against racism and occupied Fisk Hall on February 21, 1969. After a request for classes to be cancelled to honor a memorial service for the recently murdered Malcolm X was denied by Wesleyan’s administration, Black members of the campus community took over Fisk Hall, shutting down all regular operations in what was, at the time, the main academic hall on campus. Using the language lab, they broadcasted messages from Malcolm X’s speeches. Spectators gathered around to listen, and the takeover became a watershed moment in the University’s history. A statement outlining the mission of the takeover was announced. “In occupying Fisk Hall, we seek to dramatically expose the University’s infidelity to its professed goals and to question the sincerity of its commitment to meaningful change. We blaspheme and decry that education which is consonant with one cultural frame of reference to the exclusion of all others.” The cohort then made a series of demands, including the establishment of both housing and a cultural center for Black students, an exchange program with the University of Atlanta, African American Studies classes, and an increase in the number of Black students and faculty. After administration officials agreed to consider the demands, the takeover ended peacefully after about 12 hours. The takeover proved to be an immense success for Black students at the time, with the administration accepting the majority of the demands. The long-lasting legacy of the Fisk Takeover can be found today in buildings like Malcolm X House, which was renamed from John Wesley House, previously in honor of the Methodist founder of Wesleyan. On the 40th anniversary of the takeover, Ujamaa—the University’s Black student collective—reprinted a list of the demands with checkmarks next to accepted demands, and question marks next to unfulfilled ones, such as the University of Atlanta exchange program. In 2014, students created a video in honor of the Fisk Takeover, which is available on YouTube. Commemorations of the Fisk Takeover may take place this week, as well as potential alumni engagement with the Vanguard Class, the 13 Black students who first enrolled in the University.

		"title": "The Demise of the Democrats",
		"date": "2017-02-23",
		"authors": "by Henry Spiro, Foreign Correspondent",
		"content": "What happened to the Democratic Party? Once the party of “hope and change,” the Democrats are incredibly fragmented and barely able to generate excitement around their message. They failed to elect someone who would be the first female President in U.S. history while she was running against an insane mad man and multi-million dollar “man of the people.” They’ve lost hold of the excitement they generated back in 2008 and become an absolute embarrassment at a time when the American people need them more than ever. As it currently stands, the Democratic Party is primarily divided into two groups: the ultra-progressive Berniecrats, and the left-of-center “pragmatic” Democrats who wish to continue with the same basic economic policies as former President Barack Obama. It’s a divide that likely had been growing since the beginning of Obama’s presidency, with the rise of “Occupy Wall Street” and other protests around the country that demanded radical changes in the United States’ economic policies after the Wall Street collapse of 2008. Now, after he departed from the White House, the Democrats are in worse shape than ever. The rift within the Democratic Party, however, became most apparent during the Democratic primaries of the 2016 presidential election, in which former independent and relatively unknown politician Bernie Sanders soared into the spotlight. He held massive, energetic rallies. He was impersonated by former “Seinfeld” producer and writer Larry David on Saturday Night Live and eventually made a cameo alongside him. He became a symbol of both American frustration and idealism, of rage at the machine and the belief that, with enough concentrated effort, it can be fixed. Bernie Sanders was an extraordinary force on the campaign trail, to the point where his name became one of the defining cultural icons of 2016. But once Bernie lost the primary and the excitement around his campaign began to fade, it became immediately clear that something was rotten with the state of the Democratic Party. How could an old socialist generate more excitement from progressives than Hillary Clinton, a candidate to be the first female President? How could the party of the working class alienate them so? How could a major party in America be openly advocating socialism when the term “liberal” was once taboo? It is now clear that the Democratic Party is deeply divided. Many were outraged at the “neoliberal” policies that they had been carrying out for years. From Bill Clinton to Obama and, if she had won, Hillary, Democrats had ignored the working classes and had far too much support for harmful trade deals and loose regulations. Furthermore, Obama had failed to live up to his much-hyped campaign promises, failing to end conflicts in the Middle East and not delivering on enough of the excitement and progress that his campaign had promised. On the most divisive and heated issues of American politics, from Occupy to Black Lives Matter, Obama responded with passivity, not willing to confront the issues head on. This left the Democrats in a fragile state, unable to meet the demands of the American people. The United States did not suddenly evolve into the liberal utopia many had expected Obama could create, leaving some Democrats bitter and spiteful. Now, with an election for DNC Chairman taking place this Sunday, the entire future of the Democratic Party is up for grabs. There are 10 candidates up for the job, but only two have a big enough national profile to have a legitimate chance of winning. Each is symbolic of the different sides of the Democratic divide. Do the Democrats go for the energetic, Bernie-esque progressive in the form of Keith Ellison? Or do they stick to Obama’s status quo in the form of his former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez? Either choice has obvious pros and cons. Perez would continue to push for Obama-era policies, which are more practical than anything a Berniecrat would push and could genuinely help the economy. The downside of continuing with Obama’s policies is that they represent more of the same: some tax raises, obnoxious and uncompromising Republican pushback, etc. More importantly than the details of his actual policies, however, is that this sameness will limit the appeal of both Perez and the Democratic Party as a whole. If this election (and, in its own way, the 2008 election of Barack Obama) has proven anything, it’s that people hate the status quo. Everyone wants something to change; the system is broken; revolution is necessary; “Make America Great Again.” His policies may or may not work in practice, but his status as “more of the same” makes him a totally unexciting and uninspiring choice. Ellison, on the other hand, is more of a Sanders surrogate, representing the progressive, far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Ellison is the far more exciting choice for the Democrats. He represents a revolutionary change in the status quo along the lines of everyone’s favorite grandpa (Sanders, obviously). He could energize the base of Democratic supporters in a way that Hillary never could and that Obama only could back in 2008. Based on voting data, a more progressive, further left-wing Democratic Party is seemingly what this country wants. Ellison is the first Muslim to be elected to U.S. Congress, making him the perfect symbol of Trump opposition. His early support of Sanders’ campaign will help gain the support of young voters disillusioned by the centrist wing of the party. He could dust off the cobwebs of the aging Democratic Party and encourage political activism for left-wing causes in a way that America needs right now. Because now, perhaps more than ever, America needs civic engagement in its political system. In case you haven’t been paying attention, the President of the United States is a both a fearmongerer and an idiot, incapable of articulating sentences correctly while having mastered the art of scapegoating everyone’s problems on Mexico and Muslims. Not only that, but every major move he makes, from bashing and discrediting the media to his worrying relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggests he’s an autocrat waiting to seize power. The moment in history we are living through is, as best said by military historian Eliot A. Cohen, “…one of those clarifying moments in American history….” It is a time in which the foundations of our democracy are threatened by an unstable, power-hungry leader with no regard for the Constitution or acknowledgment of any restraints on his power. Furthermore, he ran on the Republican Party ticket and energized their base voters in a way that hasn’t been seen in years. In doing so, he’s given the Republicans every reason to support him: If they don’t, they’ll lose popularity and be unable to pass their agenda. When Speaker of the House Paul Ryan criticized Trump for his leaked tape with Billy Bush, Ryan’s popularity among Republicans dropped by 28 points in just over a week. Other prominent Republicans seem to be more interested in passing their agenda and holding onto their political careers than, say, having basic principles and a moral backbone. So, as former G.W. Bush speechwriter David Frum has argued, Trump and his power grabs are unlikely to be opposed by Republicans. America now finds itself in a perilous place, facing an ironic plot twist: The party of big government is now the only major check on government power. Which is why their internal divides must be healed and they must unify regardless of who becomes Chairman this weekend. Ultimately, the Democrats must do what the Republicans can do best: unify around an agenda, whatever it may be. The major divides within the left, if unhealed, could spell doom for not only the future of the Democratic Party, but of a free democracy in America. The Democratic Party must save America from itself. Hopefully they can save themselves first. Spiro is a member of the Class of 2019."

		"title": "Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro Calls Students to Action",
		"date": "2017-04-06",
		"authors": "by Emmy Hughes, Assistant News Editor",
		"content": "In response to the election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. president, the Wesleyan Democrats (WesDems) are hosting a succession of political speakers in a series called “Resistance in the Age of Trump.” This series aims to demonstrate the steps current Democrats in office are taking to oppose the Trump administration, in addition to informing the University and Middletown communities of actions they too can take. On April 1, the series opened with Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro as its first speaker, addressing a full audience in the University’s Public Affairs Center. After an introduction from state representative and Wesleyan alumnus Matt Lesser ’10 and WesDems president Simon Korn ’17, Rosa DeLauro took to the podium—though over the course of the talk she spent little time behind it, preferring instead to walk around the floor. She opened the talk with a call to action, noting the necessity for persistent efforts on the part of the nation’s public. “There’s such a need for your drive and your energy right now,” DeLauro said. “The way I characterize it, it’s really dangerous times, perilous times. So your engagement and involvement…is really critically important. Moving on to note the importance of paying attention to the multifaceted dimensions of certain issues, DeLauro entreated students to stay informed in order to ensure their voices are heard. “It’s important to understand the nuances of the various debates that are occurring in the Congress, the fine points of those debates,” DeLauro said. “To the extent that you find an area that you’re particularly interested in, follow that, because it’s not always what you read in the paper or what you hear on the news, et cetera. It’s much more granular than that in terms of what the outcomes are and can be in these events. As I said, these are a difficult few months. We are in uncharted waters.” DeLauro then moved into a discussion about the Affordable Care Act, explaining the dynamics surrounding the Trump Administration’s attempt, and subsequent failure, to repeal it. She brought up multiple perspectives on the issue, noting first the unity of the Democratic National Party in regard to preserving the Affordable Care Act, and the important role the public paid in keeping the bill afloat. “I believe that the reason why that bill was pulled, and they had such a failure, was because of the American people,” she said. “The marches, the phone calls, the letters, the communication. The overwhelming communication, to people, not just in their offices in Washington, but in their district offices. It was overwhelming.” DeLauro transitioned into a criticism of a number of people Trump chose to put into office, namely Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruit. “Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education,” DeLauro said. “Wow. I don’t know what to say…She does not believe in public education… And talk about separation of church and state, she has a major tie with religious institutions, and I went through 16 years of Catholic education, but this is not public education, which is 90 percent of our kids. She does not believe in making sure that they are provided for. So we will do the same thing; I’m watching the administration as closely as I can.” Likewise, DeLauro noted the negative consequences of the Trump administration’s decision to place Scott Pruitt as the administrator of the EPA. DeLauro mentioned that Pruitt had sued the EPA over a dozen times, and that not only does he not believe climate change is caused by humans, but he also rescinded executive orders from the Obama administration that protected the environment and curbed emissions. “They’ve got the wrong priorities,” she said. “We’ve got to protect scientists and researchers.” After finishing her talk with another call to action, in which she stressed the necessity of political involvement, DeLauro took questions from the audience. Théo Storella ’20 posed a question concerning hope for moving forward efforts on prominent issues under this administration. “Resistance is really good to keep things from moving backwards, and that’s great, but for these issues like healthcare and the environment and stuff like that, we not only need to keep ourselves from moving back, we’ve got to go forward,” he said. “So if we don’t have the house of representatives, would you say there’s kind of a degree of hopelessness in that?” DeLauro replied by explaining the necessity of first fighting Republicans on their efforts to dismantle both healthcare and environmental laws, and then from there, Democrats furthering efforts in both. She explained the importance of the 2018 elections in getting things turned around, as well as mentioned the importance of ensuring the Affordable Care Act was not repealed. She noted that no matter what, one should not lose hope. “I never talk about hopelessness, I got to tell you that, I never go there,” she said. “I can’t go there.” Korn and board member Alexandra Prendergast ’20 both thought it to be a successful and extremely relevant event. “This is one of the components of our plan to become a focal point for the resistance against the Trump administration on campus,” Korn explained. “It’s about asking people who have experiences with resisting presidential administrations, the Trump administration specifically, [and] making a difference in the face of long odds, or making a difference in the face of any kind of odds. How we, as Wesleyan students, who live in a liberal district, who by and large come from liberal districts, can make a difference.” Prendergast shared in Korn’s sentiment as to the importance of bringing speakers to the University. “This year, we’re seeing a lot more political activism nationwide than we have in many, many years, and so I think it’s extremely important as Wesleyan democrats that we engage with the community here on campus and elsewhere to try and get people active and involved in politics,” she said. Despite the heavy topic, DeLauro’s speech and Q&A session was ultimately hopeful. “People cannot get tired of engaging on these issues,” she said. “You’ve got to overwhelm the system.”"

		"title": "University to Move Forward With Equity and Inclusion Resource Center",
		"date": "2017-04-06",
		"authors": "by Jenny Davis, Executive Editor",
		"content": "c/o Wesleyan University The University has set official plans in motion to address the first of three Equity Task Force recommendations: constructing a resource center devoted to increasing equity and inclusion. The proposal for the Center was submitted in early March, and University President Michael Roth ’78 has authorized a search for a director for the Center. The proposal for the Center grows out of the #IsThisWhy campaign and the subsequent Task Force recommendations, which suggested first that the administration “develop a Center with an intellectually grounded mission in social justice and a focus on intercultural development and literacy.” (The other two recommendations are to address discrimination and marginalization in the faculty, staff, and curricula, as well as to implement a committee to “coordinate, communicate and support change in these areas.”) Designed by the Equity and Inclusion Steering Committee (EISC), the proposal for the Center includes specific plans for supporting students in four broad categories: students of color, those who are queer and transgender, those who are low income and/or first generation, and those who are female-identifying. “Although Wesleyan has made significant progress towards ameliorating marginalization, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, more remains to be done,” reads the proposal’s introduction. “The Center is aligned with the mission of Wesleyan University, the Board of Trustees Statement on Equity and Inclusion, and the Office for Equity and Inclusion. Together, we assert a commitment to creating and sustaining a culture of diversity, egalitarianism, and altruism in all aspects of campus life.” The EISC, which was assembled in the fall of 2016, consists of President of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) Rebecca Hutman ’17; Evelysse Vargas ’17; Ainsley Eakins ’18; Vice President for Equity and Inclusion and Title IX Officer Antonio Farias; Irma González, Chair of the Campus Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees; and Janice Naegele, Professor of Biology and Vice Chair of the Faculty. Its work was also supported by Mike Whaley, Vice President for Student Affairs, as well as a Student Advisory Board that included Caroline Liu ’18, Justina Yam ’19, Justin Ratkovic ’20, Hanh Pham ’19, and Keishan Christophe ’19. Vargas noted that the four overarching groups that the Center aims to support come from pre-existing categories and structures devoted to advocating for those identity groups, but that the groups are not all-encompassing—and nor, she believes, should they be. “It isn’t exhaustive,” she said. “We might be talking about gender differently in ten years, sexuality, race. We don’t really know where this is going to go. We have ideas, but it’s important to keep a kind of openness for different groups to say, ‘Hey, can this be our resource center too?’” Hutman spoke to the importance of including a wide range of student voices in the proposal-writing process. “There was an interest in having student input because a lot of people recognized that this center grew out of student demands and student protests, and we wanted the spirit of those movements to help shape the process itself,” she said. Whaley explained the choice to tackle the Center before the other two Task Force recommendations. “I know one of the other recommendations was a critique of the training that happens on an ongoing basis for different segments of our community, including faculty and staff,” he said. “And I think that what you see in the proposal is the idea that the Center would serve as not really a hub for all of that, because there are different avenues and mechanisms for the training to happen, but in some ways that there’s coordination and the center serves as a catalyst for that happening.” The proposal for the Center includes a detailed explanation of the programming that will occur there, including convening workshops for students, faculty, and staff to discuss social phenomena and themes such as transphobia and microaggressions at Wesleyan; bringing speakers to campus; and brainstorming ways in which student groups can “translate their lived experiences into innovative and impactful work and action.” The Center will occupy the building at 167 High Street, currently the Shapiro Creative Writing Center, which will relocate. Whaley explained why he believes that central location to be an effective choice. “Having it on the periphery seems antithetical, to me, to what it’s supposed to be about,” he said. “And so when I heard that the Shapiro Creative Writing Center would be moving, I was thinking, ‘Wow, that could be a really interesting space.’” Eakins, who was an integral member of 2015’s #IsThisWhy? movement, reflected that writing the proposal for a Center achievable in the short term required compromise. “I had a lot of dreams for it,” she said. “And just in the process of us outlining the bronze, silver, gold models, I wanted the gold, and I thought the gold should have already been there fifteen years ago. So I guess I thought it would be a huge space, and it would automatically become somewhere low-income students could go to get the groceries that they need, or get grants for the things that they aren’t able to get, or that students of color can make a complaint against some racist practice, and it would be dealt with. I thought it would be implemented so easily, and I was very naïve in thinking that way.” Even so, Eakins believes that the proposal will yield a Center poised to thrive. She pointed to one particular possibility: the easy and immediate availability of resources such as explanatory pamphlets and zines. “There are so many student groups that make zines that talk about these issues and explain them so well, but you have to go to a specific person and go try to get it, make copies, or you have to go to an event,” Eakins said. “When I imagine the Center, I imagine there being pamphlets all around that everyone would have access to. If you have questions, you don’t even have to Google it—you can just go in and ask some of the interns that will be housed there. That’s essential in the long run: not just providing resources to the most marginalized, but making sure the privileged can do that too.” Hutman explained that another key component of the Center’s work will be its communication with academic departments. “We’ll have a faculty fellow in the center who will work with different academic departments to infuse conversations about issues of social injustice and marginalization into the classrooms for professors and students who might not feel comfortable having those conversations in other cases,” she said. Farias noted what he sees as an important challenge for the realization of the Center. “Sustaining the initial energy around the Center and expecting that there will be missteps and less than optimal events or engagements as a normal part of launching a new entity on campus will be the biggest challenge,” he said. “I have the highest regard for the intellect, passion, and emotional core of the students, staff, and faculty that will serve and be served by this Center, and expect we’ll find creative solutions to complex and messy problems—which in the end is the highest value diversity brings to us—the ability to bring difference into a room without homogenizing it and solving complex problems that make us more inclusive in a world that is more equitable than how we found it.” González stressed that the proposal, while a useful blueprint, is far from a fully realized vision for the Center. “We assume the center will grow and evolve and be responsive to what students, faculty, and staff need on campus,” she said. “We’ve got something on the table, and it’s moving forward at an even faster pace than the Equity Taskforce hoped it would. It’s only going to be as good as we continue to make it be.” Hutman agreed. “[Vargas] and I are graduating,” she said. “[Eakins] is going to be here for one more year. It’s really important that the concept of the center is internalized by the people who will really be here to see it through, and the specific programs that come from them.”"
