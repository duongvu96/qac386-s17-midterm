"Syracuse U. president applies town-gown relations to Wes","2006-12-01","by Katherine Manchester, Assistant News","Interactive, reciprocal initiatives between colleges and their local communities are essential for higher education to continue to enrich society, guest speaker Nancy Cantor said in a Center for the Arts (CFA) lecture on Wednesday night in the Memorial Chapel. “Momentum is growing to take public scholarship seriously, as a movement that will challenge and reshape the relationship between our colleges and universities and the society of which they are a part,” she said.  Cantor is the 11th chancellor and president of Syracuse University, in Syracuse, New York. She has gained national recognition for her strong advocacy in favor of public scholarship, a policy that she sees as fundamental if universities seek to benefit their communities. “If universities are to continue to expand our essential role in our democracy, producing innovation that makes a difference and educating enthusiastic citizens as well as skilled technicians, we must learn to construct these local collaborations in shared third spaces,” she said.  In the practice of public scholarship, Cantor said, the outward-looking stance of the projects often cut across the boundaries of traditional disciplines, geographies and roles. “The enterprise itself changes the relationship between expert and novice, between teaching, scholarship, and civic engagement—often rolling them all into one,” she said.  Cantor cited a number of Syracuse’s efforts to develop public scholarship, including the renovation of an old furniture warehouse in downtown Syracuse to house the university’s School of Architecture. “The Warehouse” also contains a public gallery, a café, and meeting rooms to be used by local artists and other community members.   “We are seeing the catalyzing effect of both the Warehouse itself and the concentration of design and entrepreneurial expertise downtown,” Cantor said.  At the moment, Syracuse’s most ambitious project is participation in constructing a “Connective Corridor,” a street that will run all the way across New York State in order to link suburbs with downtowns. In Syracuse’s case, this street will serve to connect the university with the city. “This will be a cultural corridor,” said Cantor. “It will connect all of the city’s cultural institutions [like] the local historical society, museums, concert halls, theaters, and galleries.”   Cantor stressed that, if carried out successfully, public scholarship initiatives allow universities and communities to interact in three crucial ways. “First, there is innovation that matters locally,” she said. “Public scholarship promotes discovery work outside of the ivory tower. Second, it promotes conversations that change the dialogue from seeing citizenship as a matter of stakeholder rights, to an act of community building among citizens with responsibilities to each other. Third, it brings new and diverse voices to the table, which has a strong democratizing effect.”  In the lengthy question-and-answer session that followed, Cantor addressed the audience’s queries about the finer points of public scholarship, and what stood in the way of such programs.  “Everyone thinks the question of money is the hardest,” she said, “But we have found that if projects are clearly seen as for, by, and with the community, they take on a lot of momentum very quickly, which galvanizes support. We don’t do projects within the community unless we have multiple partners.” Cantor noted that one of the greatest challenges was promoting the idea of change at a local level. “Sometimes people view local initiatives as parochial and narrow,” she said. “They ask, ‘What about the big picture?’ I don’t know about Middletown, but Syracuse has instances of every single global problem out there, especially in terms of immigration.”  One student questioned changes in perceptions of student safety, given a situation where so much community-student interaction was taking place. “I don’t think that students are any more at risk downtown than they are on University Hill, but we took the issue very seriously because we knew that safety concerns would be a psychological barrier to students’ comfort,” Cantor said.  While the audience was relatively small and consisted primarily of faculty and administrators, Cantor was well received.  Lauren Tinkoff ’07, student coordinator for the Green Street Arts Center, enjoyed the talk and found Cantor’s ideas applicable to the University community. “The lecture was especially relevant to me because Green Street is a practical application of the theory she discussed,” Tinkoff said. “Her talk was an inspiration to Wesleyan to expand its partnerships with Middletown and see the potential for positive change.”"
"Scobey urges an end to insular academic attitudes","2007-02-09","by Chelsea Sprayregan, Contributing Writer","David Scobey believes he has the solution for two cultural crises.  Speaking last Wednesday at the Memorial Chapel, he discussed the growing movement toward integration of university arts and humanities with community engagement.  Scobey emphasized the benefits that such integration would have in solving the respective problems of the university and the community at large. The universities’ predicament, Scobey explained, is a growing public disillusionment with higher education.  Citing budget cuts and a referendum vote against affirmative action in Michigan as evidence, Scobey explained that the public no longer considers the universities’ vast resources and autonomy to be justified.  These attitudes, accompanied by rising tuition rates throughout the country, have further entrenched the universities’ reputation as a bastion of elitism, isolated from general society. According to Scobey, this issue goes hand-in-hand with a larger societal crisis: that of growing distrust in government.  While widespread voter apathy presents the most obvious evidence of this skepticism, Scobey maintained it is only a symptom of a larger problem. Scobey argued that these crises can only be solved together, through community partnerships with university arts and humanities.  He advocated the creation of third spaces, where members of diverse groups can come together in collaborative ways to develop both civic culture and intellectual life, with the underlying belief that each group can offer the other something it could not have gleaned on its own. Members of the academic community, Scobey said, can gain a richer understanding of the people they purport to explain.   Scobey emphasized that the university need not lose any of its academic rigor, but rather that professional academics must apply this intellectualism in new ways based on insights they would not otherwise have found.  Scobey described the moment when he chose to work toward community engagement. “It felt like a turn away from the provincialism of academic culture in which I’d boxed myself,” Scobey said. In an often polarized society, Scobey explained that these community programs can help people to gain understanding of groups with which they would not normally engage.  More importantly, these diverse groups can work together, using the arts and humanities, in the process of “meaning making,” and thus regain a stake in their own civic life.  Given this dynamic definition of culture, university humanities and the arts must participate in the process of meaning making, or else its work of understanding society becomes a falsity. Scobey has directed two centers for community partnerships, and he used his experiences to ground otherwise abstract ideas in examples of successful projects.  Scobey spoke of a piece of artwork he recently viewed, a collage of different media that included interviews with members of the Arab community in Dearborn, MI and a poem about riding the subway after Sept. 11.  The piece came to fruition through the University of Michigan’s Arts of Citizenship program, of which he is former director. As present director of the Harward Center for Community Partnerships at Bates College, Scobey is working with a group of students in collaboration with a local museum to create an exhibit honoring the experience of Franco-American mill workers in Bates’ hometown of Lewiston, ME.  Scobey stressed the importance of collaboration within both projects.  “We create products and insights that none of us could create separately,” Scobey said. Before his lecture, Scobey spent the day at both the University and the Green Street Arts Center.  “It’s potentially just the kind of ‘third space,’ co-developed by the University and the community, where transformative work can happen that will enrich both Middletown’s North End community and the Wesleyan education,” Scobey said. The audience of arts and humanities faculty, community partners, and a few students proved highly receptive to Scobey’s ideas.  One woman raised her hand at the end simply to thank Scobey for his inspiring lecture.  Most of the questions addressed practical ways in which Scobey’s ideas might be applied. “It was very nice to hear someone talk about interaction rather than just seeing community involvement as going in and fixing whatever problems we see,” said Emily Sheehan ’10. The lecture mostly addressed institutional changes, and thus the faculty who might make them possible.  Yet the students who did attend were impressed.   “I think this is definitely going to give me some added inspiration to figure out what I owe the Middletown community or what I can learn from the Middletown community, and I hope to begin that process soon,” said Ari Tolman ’10. Scobey came to the University after meeting Pamela Tatge, director of Wesleyan’s Center for the Arts, and Rob Rosenthal, director of the University’s Service Learning Center, part of the Center for Community Partnerships, at a consortium of over 70 colleges called Imagining America. Imagining America is committed to work in public scholarships in the arts and humanities.   Tatge and Rosenthal invited Scobey to lecture as part of a series co-sponsored by their respective organizations entitled Scholarship and Action: The Case for Engagement. Nancy Cantor, president of Syracuse University, whom Tatge and Rosenthal also met at Imagining America, gave the series’ keynote address in November.  The three subsequent speakers, Scobey being the first, each represent one of the University’s academic divisions.  Tom Hayden will speak in March on behalf of the social sciences.  The speaker for April, representing math and natural sciences, is yet to be announced."
"Q and A with President-elect Michael Roth","2007-05-01","by Greg DubinskyEric Lach, Editors-in-Chief","Saturday morning, we sat down with Michael Roth to ask him about his trip, his personal experiences as a student, and his plans for Wesleyan come fall. Note that the interview is edited for brevity and clarity.  Greg Dubinsky: I was thinking about the focus of your work while you were speaking [in the Memorial Chapel on Friday], this idea of freedom through work. I almost felt like I was reading Introduction to the Reading of Hegel. [Editor’s note: This is a book written by a philosopher, Alexander Kojéve, whose correspondence Michael Roth edited.] Michael Roth: (Laughs) Oh goodness gracious, that’s right, you’re on the inside. GD: It was interesting to me to find out a bit more about that, and how you would connect that idea to practical outcomes and issues such as chalking or the independence of departments, or how that translates into practice.  MR: I think the way it would play out in specific Wesleyan policy or around Wesleyan issues is something I don’t know enough yet about to comment in an interesting way. Someone gave me a box of chalk yesterday and my daughter immediately grabbed it thinking it was for her. She said, can I play with this? “No!” What I was trying to say yesterday in regard to freedom and work was that the education at Wesleyan taught me that there was a way one could work that was an expression of what one hoped to be. And getting a sense of that as a social scientist, a biologist, a musician or a writer, whatever the field, gives one a sense of human capacity and a feeling of freedom that sets a platform for how one wants to work after graduation. One wants to find a way of working in the world that is significant for oneself and one sees making a contribution in the world. And there are lots of ways to do that. It doesn’t have to be through some narrow prism of academic work or narrow version of activism. So the contrast I was trying to draw was between that and the kind of work where one feels alien to oneself. Work that most people have to do in our culture. Which is, it may be monetarily satisfying, or not, but you don’t feel like yourself when you’re at work. What I learned at Wesleyan, from doing it myself and from looking around at people who were joyful about what they were doing, was that there are ways of being dedicated to a pursuit that allows you to discover who you are and what you want to be and how you can make a difference in the world.  Autonomy of departments, I don’t know. I don’t know enough about what that means at Wesleyan. I’m not a departmentally oriented academic. I can say that. It’s probably pretty clear from what I’ve done. I don’t believe in the silos of academic departments, I think that requirements are bad. I learned that here—we debated that endlessly when I was a student. I think it’s great for students to have the freedom to choose the kinds of courses they want to take and to make their own way. Sometimes that can be within a structure. If you’re a music major, there’s a structure of how to progress, or [also] if you’re a biology major. Sometimes it can be much more self-generated, as I had a University major. I think the key is that you are following your passion and you are discovering what you love to do. My sense is that the reason a lot of students become so loyal to Wesleyan is that they really do discover what they love to do here. Then they get better at it and that’s great fun and exciting. And they make friends around their work and sometimes through their work. And that’s a gift I believe. As a result, students may be critical of the University, because they want it to be even better, to provide that all the time or in a deeper way, but they are also incredibly loyal to the University because of that gift, because of that experience. I hope that begins to answer that question. Six months out, your successors can expect a more detailed answer.  Eric Lach: It seems people were pretty pleased with your talk yesterday in Memorial Chapel. I’m wondering how you set out to write your introduction? MR: (Laughs) I didn’t write anything, I didn’t know what I was going to say. I do have this, I don’t know what to call it, maybe it’s a symptom, maybe it’s a tick, maybe it’s a style. I do like to improvise. I guess I learned that at Wesleyan. I took jazz piano lessons here from a wonderful instructor.  Justin gave me a couple of points, to thank so and so. And I looked at those in the afternoon, and then I was thinking in the afternoon, “What am I going to talk about, what am I going to talk about, this is too important, Roth, to do your typical improvisation.”  In San Francisco, I do a lot of public speaking, and it’s like a dog that can sing—“Gosh, he’s improvising again.” And I enjoy that and people seem to like it. But I thought this is going to be webcast, I can’t say, “Whoa, I didn’t really say that.” “Yes, you did!” And I kept wondering if I should write it down, I heard the voices of authority saying, “You should write it out, you’re a writer.” But I really felt like the energy would be better, and everybody said it should be brief, if I just said what came to mind.  So, I thought, okay, as you know, I spent a lot of time with Hegel at Wesleyan and since, so I do think in threes. So I thought: if I have three points in my head I won’t get lost. And then it just occurred to me when I saw the police car in front of South College as we were getting photographs, I thought, “Okay, I’ll do liberty, equality, and fraternity.” So then I was a little nervous, because I thought, that’s all I knew that I was going to do, talk about freedom, equality, and, when I teach I translate “fraternity” into “solidarity” or “community” because I think it’s the contemporary expression of that ideal—it’s not sexist. And I remembered when I had this notion of freedom and work, which was here at Wesleyan, so I thought it would be fitting to say that, but I didn’t know what I was going to say. And my wife said, “I think you have four things, because you put diversity in there.” But I didn’t think of it until I said it. So last night I listened to it on the web just to see what the hell I said! (Laughs) And being in a chapel, I’m a wannabe rabbi, people say, or preacher, and so when I get in a chapel I’m even more inclined to [just] see what happens. So the process was really to come up with the structure of three things and then see what happens. When you’re playing jazz or rock and roll, it’s even simpler, you need a three-chord progression. If you know you are going to do A, D, and E, you’ll see what happens. EL: So we shouldn’t expect a reign of terror next year, though, right? MR: I did think of that. Somebody might say the Nazis said, “Work makes free.” So there are lots of incredibly oppressive versions of these ideals. But that’s true of great ideals—some people distort them into horrible things. And that’s something to be mindful of. But I don’t think it’s a reason not to be idealistic, it’s just a reason to be thoughtful. GD: It seems that part of the definition of freedom is having the capacity to affect one’s environment, and maybe a corresponding obligation to affect one’s environment in a positive way. I’m wondering what your thoughts are on Wesleyan’s connection to Middletown and how that might play out in your administration? MR: I heard really positive things about how Doug Bennet and Midge Bennet have built partnerships with Middletown. And I want to understand that better. My own interest and values lead me to want to develop connections for the students and the institution with the city we’re a part of and the state we’re a part of. I think it’s really important for students to understand not only the campus they’re on, but the city they’re in, and the political context in which they live—beyond the campus. That would mean like service learning, which I know has become more important at Wesleyan over the years, but it also means project-based curriculum, which interests me a great deal. Where students can actually take classes, the content of which is heavily inflected by practical projects in the world, and that can be in a science class or in a political science class [or others].  I think that participation is a key value in the arts, so students learning how to not only perform for spectators but to engage people into participatory art-making is a really interesting experience and very educational, and it also is great for the people who are invited into the mix of making. And I’ve done all those things with colleagues in Claremont and Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, and I would expect to find opportunities to do that here. I haven’t been to the Green St. Center yet, but I understand it’s a really interesting place and I’ve gotten notes from people who work there and I look forward to visiting it. And there may be other avenues for that connection to happen, and I would certainly be very supportive of developing those connections. They’re not just expressions of altruism, which is not a bad thing, but they are really vehicles for learning—for students, faculty, and staff. One of the things you learn is about citizenship and being part of the community, which I do think is connected to the values I talked about yesterday.  I muck around on the guitar and piano, it’s not something I can do unless it’s a really good party, but playing a little bit changes the way you listen, and dancing a little bit changes the way you watch, and I think that’s a very important experience to have. The practice of creativity, the practice of thinking, changes the way you understand what people who are experts in the area say.  GD: Should there be a mandatory commitment to civil [or] civic service? MR: There could be, you know that’s where you would no doubt detect a contradiction, if I wanted that, because I don’t like mandatory commitments. I have in the past thought about that. At other places like CCA my first thought was, “We have requirements, why don’t we have a service learning requirement and why don’t we just hire people that teach that way,” but it was the wrong thought. Because what happens when you make things a requirement is that people aren’t interested in them. So I don’t know if requirements are the answer here. I kind of doubt it, just given a little of what I know so far. But making it really great is what draws people, and then they’ll want to do it. Again, I do think sometimes structure is important, but my prejudice is to not go to that structure too early. Invitations are better than force.  EL: So you mentioned yesterday at the student talk that you had been involved in a takeover of the president’s office. I was wondering what you were protesting.  MR: Oh, God, did I say that? That had to be improvised. We were protesting apartheid. The reason I hesitate is because the other big protest I was involved in was—well, less involved with when I was here afterwards—was Seabrook, New Hampshire, a very hot issue in the late ’70s. The nuclear power plant at Seabrook gives me food for my political philosophy classes today.  EL: So you guys took it over for a day, or a couple of days? MR: No, I don’t think it was a couple of days. I remember it was probably a day, a day or so. It would be, I guess, ’77-’78, that year. I remember President [Colin] Campbell coming in and being very gracious. What happened was, and I think this is what we wanted, is that it became a conversation about how to engage the issue at the university level. I’ve learned about it since and talking with people about [how] what the University did in regard to divestment in companies doing business with South Africa was really an engagement with those companies, forcing them to explain themselves in a public way, because as stockholders you had this kind of leverage, which if you just sold your stock you’d no longer have. So it was a very interesting process, much more sophisticated than I understood at the time. Part of it came out of the fact that there was a community revulsion against the regime in South Africa—it took longer in a way, but I think in a way it was a more significant action of engaging these companies, forcing them to respond to these political and moral issues. GD: So success can be a difficult thing to define for many at a university like Wesleyan. I’m wondering: how would you measure [the] success of Wesleyan while you are there? Would you rely on the U.S. News and World Report? What would be the criteria that you would use to measure how you’re doing, where you can improve? MR: There are a couple of things. It’s a really important question, and I want to determine in the next few months which metrics would be the most important and to use them. Everyone seems to agree that Wesleyan is underresourced in regard to its competitors—the endowment per student is not as high as it is at Williams and other schools. One very important goal for the future, that the Bennet administration has made very good progress on that needs to be continued and accelerated, is to bring more resources to the University. A key metric for me will be successful fundraising. I think we talked last time about doubling the endowment. It seems like a good goal to have. I don’t know how much time it will take to do that, but in the first year I’ll know how much time. We should double the endowment, and part of that will be from intelligent use of the resources, and part of it will be from bringing new resources, a combination of those.  One of the really important aspects of that is that it will allow us to provide more access to people. I think one of the things that I didn’t make clear in my remarks yesterday—I listened to them last night—is exactly where would equality come out in policies. I think access to Wesleyan and access to universities like Wesleyan is a really important issue in the United States and internationally. A university like Wesleyan can’t be a place for only rich people. Need-blind admissions is really very important, but nonetheless the preparation you need to be successful in the admissions process is clearly very biased by class, at least—other things too, but class plays a big role. To have a university like Wesleyan make the contribution to opening up this dream of great education to more talented people who don’t have the advantages of education earlier on—that’s the question. I don’t have the answer yet. And I don’t think Wesleyan can do it alone, but I do think Wesleyan should be a leader in this area, and Wesleyan should work with other institutions to create avenues for success for people—whether it’s for middle school or high school —to give them the preparation so they can go to an elite university—that could be Wesleyan, Harvard, oh, Williams wouldn’t count—kidding!—but, you know, to play a role [in] making education function not just as a way of supporting privilege but as a way of giving access to the kinds of values I talked about yesterday. Bringing resources is going to be important to do that—you need money to do that. You’re not going to take it out of the current program, that’s impossible.  Another measure will be who wants to come to Wesleyan. I want the applicant pool to continue to grow. It grows nicely. We have incredibly great applicants. I looked at the profile of the class coming in—it’s incredibly impressive. Let’s take the things we like the most of the applicant pool and let’s say, “How do we improve those things by five percent to seven percent per year?” Make it really hard, actually—it’s a tough goal to reach. The demographics are going to flip soon. Right now you don’t have to be a genius to get more applications because more people are at that age, but in a few years that will change. So how does Wesleyan know people are finding out how great the place is? More people want to come here. More people, not just in Boston, New York, and this corridor, but in San Antonio, Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco—they say, “Oh, Wesleyan, that’s the hot school, that’s the place. I want to go here.” You know that not just from a newspaper article or something, but from how many qualified people are trying to get in. I’m not trying to expand the size of the student body, [but] it’s a good way of seeing how the message is getting out in the world. And the more the message gets out in the world, the better it is not only for the metrics, but for the people with a Wesleyan diploma, because people just value it more and more in the world. It’s already valued very highly, of course, but more and more people will value it very highly. People who know about education know about Wesleyan, but that’s only one group of people. As you move toward the Midwest and the West, the school is not as well-known as it should be, and certainly there’s been progress there—more applications from California and elsewhere. That can accelerate. What is the level of student satisfaction? That’s a metric that’s very important. I’m not sure what the best tool for measuring that is yet. Retention is very high, but Wesleyan is in a way beyond retention. You don’t just want to retain people, you want them enthusiastic and excited about being here. How you measure that—it’s harder to measure, but we’ll figure out some way to measure that. Faculty engagement and satisfaction. Are you able to hire the very best people? When you do a search, do you get the first choice? I think we do most of the time—I can find out what the number is, but we obviously have to be even better. We’re not so close to perfect that we can’t be better in that. But how do you retain people, how do you reward them for the great work they do? That’s another metric.  Those would be some of the more easily measurable things. The partnership with the city, the role in politics, is harder to measure. I do think there you get to issues of identifying stakeholders—people whose opinion about the place you care about—and somebody other than the president will find out: how do they think we’re doing? Don’t ask Roth’s mother how he’s doing, ask the mayor of Middletown, or the senator, or people who are running the community health center. Once you identify that constituency pool, you identify people whose thoughtful evaluation of performance you take into account. So those are some of them.  EL: So there’s a popular sentiment on campus that Wesleyan every year is getting less “weird”—the key word. For some reason the students have this image of the ’70s, when you were here, as the weird time, that Wesleyan was at its weird peak. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how Wesleyan was “weird” or how this label to some extent got put on Wesleyan? MR: (Laughs) I don’t know. That’s a good question. I didn’t think we were weird. I’ve heard this—I don’t know how popular it is. American education has gotten more corporatized—it’s not just Wesleyan, look at the country. But at the same time, there’s a kind of not just tolerance but an acceptance of diversity and of self-expression and experimentation that now—it’s taken for granted at Wesleyan. It wasn’t like that in the ’70s. It may have felt weird to people [then] because people were more likely to have led sheltered lives before they came here and be surprised by differences in sexual lifestyles or identity or politics or other things.  I think now people perhaps just take a lot for granted in terms of the embrace of difference within a community. Last night after the student reception, I was invited to dinner at Open House—I didn’t know what that was. I think it’s great. I don’t know that when I was a student that that would have happened with the president. I think it might just not have happened. And so that’s a good thing. The fact that it’s not weird that they asked, or that someone said, “Ooh, that’s weird,” or something. I think that’s good, actually. “Yeah, I’d love to go to dinner there, let’s talk about this or that.” It would be a mistake to put too much of an emphasis on idiosyncrasy—to search out idiosyncrasy for the sake of idiosyncrasy—that seems kind of childish to me, actually. Sometimes there are real principles at stake, and you want to make sure that people have a certain level of freedom and have a certain level of respect, and those are really important issues. But to test those standards for the heck of it—that seems to me not very interesting. There are real issues out there that people violently disagree with off campus—starting with affirmative action, or the war, or any number of issues—take the politics where it matters, I would think. And Wesleyan could be the place where you get the tools to do that, or to learn about it, to have good arguments—not just good arguments for people with like beliefs, but how do you have a good argument or a reasonable conversation with someone who doesn’t share your views? That’s different from trying to get someone who shares most of your views to go on the edge because you say something so upsetting that even they can’t accept it—that seems puerile. So, “Keep Wesleyan Weird?”  I think that Wesleyan has been for a long time a place of serious experimentation—that’s different, I think, from what I’ve just described as childish—serious experimentation, where people are passionately devoted to exploring new territory—and the place where it comes out most importantly is in their work. They’ve thought about stuff in ways no one else has thought about it. And the teacher turns to the student and says, “You talk about this. Let’s read your poem. Because you’re doing stuff I haven’t thought of.” That happens at Wesleyan. Or you do an experiment that creates new knowledge, or you put on a theatrical production that moves people so tremendously that they are stunned. That happens at Wesleyan. That’s experimentation.  Is it weird? Yeah, it’s weird, but it’s not pursuing the bizarre, it’s creating the new. So everything I can do to help students and faculty create the new, sometimes through exploring very old things, I really want to do—but the culture of shock, or of testing, I think it’s a bit of disservice actually to the culture of serious experimentation that Wesleyan has been known for. I mean, “serious” seems like a stodgy word. Norman Brown was here in the ’50s, and Carl Shorske and Bucky Fuller, John Cage—talk about weird, right? but they were pioneers. They were changing the way people felt about education, sexuality, culture, music, and silence—they were breaking barriers, and working very hard to do it—joyously, it wasn’t just testing. GD: What’s the thing you think you know the least about, or the thing you want to learn the most about?  MR: (Laughs) There are so many. It’s hard to just say one. I guess the one at the top of my list right now is the sciences and the science building, because it’s a very important issue for the institution going forward. I’m really looking forward to learning more about scientific practice as it is now taking place and how people imagine it will be taking place 10 years from now, because I just don’t know that much about it, and as a cultural historian, I should know more about that, and it’s a really important part of understanding the world and at Wesleyan. It’s a really good thing to learn more about it, and I’ve asked the provost to send me things—research papers and articles. I love being a student, as you can tell, and this is my way of going back to school in the sciences. That’s really on the academic front.  And then—I always talk in threes—on the student side, I really want to understand why students come to Wesleyan today, what is the draw today, and what is it that makes Wesleyan compelling to somebody before they come and how they experience the school in relation to their expectations. And that’ll just be going to the dorms, or the houses, and listening to students talk about their expectations and experience—that will be fascinating for me. I could see the enthusiasm of people for the place yesterday, and now I want to find out what’s the content of that. And then the third one would be the relationship of the campus to the city, the region, and the state. Just getting a handle on that will be important to me as someone leading an institution that can make a real difference in the city and the region."
"Point/Counterpoint","2008-03-04","by ,","Culled from 47 faculty and administration proposals, the five initiatives recently presented by President Michael Roth offer a wide swath of ideas on academic, extracurricular, and admissions changes within the University. We applaud Roth for drawing upon the faculty’s experience and insight when attempting to determine new policy. While recognizing that many of these initiatives remain in the planning stages, however, we cannot help but temper praise with frustration over each of the initiative’s often amorphous and ill-defined nature.  1. Strengthening the University Experience: Greater encouragement for seniors to undertake “capstone” projects may convince certain departments to broaden opportunities for those who wish to complete something other than traditional senior theses. Mandating a common class for all first year students, though, would likely result in a superficial academic experience, and seemingly contradict the University’s insistence upon flexible curriculum. 2. Internationalization: Efforts to double recruitment of international students underline the key role they play in the Wesleyan community, but the University should remember that geographic diversity also extends to underrepresented areas of the United States. As for improvements within the Office of International Studies, numerous complaints regarding credit transfers point to an issue in need of immediate attention. 3. Creative Campus: The proposed expansion of writing opportunities within the University (more courses, a potential writing certificate program) reflects a positive response to student demands. Overall, though, the initiative neglects to illustrate how the University plans to foster creativity within other majors. 4. College of the Environment: Increased attention to environmental issues are not unwelcome, but we fail to see how this proposed interdisciplinary program (modeled after the College of Letters and the College of Social Sciences) would substantially differ from pre-existing programs like the Science in Society or the Environmental Studies Certificate programs.   5. Civic Engagement: This proposal’s focus on encouraging community partnerships appears well intentioned. When over 60 percent of the student body participates in some form of community service, though, how much do we really need the administration’s encouragement? We anticipate and expect more details from the administration regarding these initiatives in the coming months. If not, the time and effort put forth by consulted faculty members will have resulted in little more than high-minded rhetoric."
"Creative campus: Roth, faculty plan enhanced curriculum","2008-03-04","by Brooke Olaussen, Contributing Writer","After reviewing faculty input on various aspects of the University, President Michael Roth has outlined five broad initiatives forming a list of the University’s priorities: strengthening the undergraduate experience, internationalization, the “creative campus,” College of the Environment and civic engagement. In October, Roth invited faculty members to submit two-page proposals addressing any aspect of the University’s educational experience. Faculty members submitted a total of 47 proposals—many of which were written by several professors or entire departments. Most of the proposals focus on developing and expanding curriculum.  The main thrusts of the first initiative, strengthening the undergraduate experience, include hiring more professors, creating a more concrete first year program and encouraging all students to do some type of last year project that would function as a “capstone experience.”   The particular components of this plan have yet to be decided upon. One possibility is to broaden first year initiative courses to include a required freshman course, the goal being to give more shape to the first year experience at the University. Roth would also like to see each student do some sort of senior thesis or project.  “Many students do this already but we haven’t successfully described this experience and tied it together in a coherent way,” said Roth.  According to Roth, this means broadening the idea of a written senior thesis to whatever could be creatively integrated into the student’s particular discipline.  The second area of focus looks to change the way the University approaches international studies. Referred to as “a stool with three legs,” this initiative looks to globalize the curriculum, double the number of international students, and strengthen study abroad programs. A Middle East Studies Program is in the works.  Roth also says that he would like to see more languages taught here. Parts of this language initiative will be implemented as part of the Summer Language Institute.  “Creative campus,” another initiative, will be an effort to expand students’ creative work to all areas of campus, from arts departments to molecular biology. Roth would like to see students exploring creativity through experimentation that would serve their respective disciplines.  “Wesleyan has an edgy, creative, experimental, risk-taking student body,” Roth said.  He feels, however, that the creative work produced is not consistent across the university, and would like to make it easier for students to be creative in their field of study. As part of fostering a more creative campus, Roth wants more art courses and an expanded writing program. The new writing program is likely to include a writing certificate program, possibly a writing major in English, more writing courses and writers on campus, a Writers’ House that coordinates events with the Writing Program’s Distinguished Writers series and an expanded Wesleyan Writers Conference. “President Roth has expressed his strong interest in Wesleyan’s writing programs,” said Director of Writing Programs Anne Greene. “The particular configuration of the new programs is being discussed.” The idea of the Writers’ House is to have a center for student writers that will involve them closely in writing activities and writers’ visits. Within a year, the Writers’ House may also include a student residence and coffee house. The non-resident house programs will begin next year, using the Russell House as a center.  New writing tutorials are being planned, as are other workshops and special events for students. Greene is now asking each guest writer who visits the University to compile a reading list of books for students who are interested in training themselves as writers. These reading lists will be used in new student-run writing tutorials. Alex Ross, the well-known blogger and music critic for the New York Times, is coming this Wednesday and will be preparing the first booklist. Also being considered is a graduate studies program in writing as well as a screenwriting program.  The fourth initiative is the College of the Environment, which will be an enhanced environmental studies program modeled off of the College of Social Sciences and College of Letters.  “[The goal is to] graduate students who are conversant in environmental issues,” said Professor of Earth and Environmental Studies Barry Chernoff, who authored the proposal for the College of the Environment. “We have to understand better our relationship to the environment in a deep and scholarly way. If it comes to pass, the program will work to graduate citizens to change the fabric of life for the country.” The environmental studies major would be the second component of  the  major. The senior “capstone experience” would integrate environmental studies into whatever is appropriate in the student’s primary field of study.  “Environmental issues by their nature are multi-disciplinary,” Chernoff said. “It’s so central to campus, environmental studies in a sense belongs on Andrus Field.” As with the other initiatives, the time frame for this program is still uncertain. An enhanced commitment to civic engagement is the last of the five categories outlined in the plan. Focusing on “action and study,” Roth would like to bring programs like the Green Street Art Center, Traverse Square and WesPREP together in a coherent form and facilitate monetary donations to these programs.  “I’d really like every student to have the possibility of some dimension of civic engagement in their Wesleyan education,” Roth said.  Professors were pleased with Roth’s openness to their ideas and criticisms.  “It is a way of honoring a faculty to ask their opinion of what direction should the university go,” said Professor of American Studies Claire Potter. “It speaks well of a president when he begins his work at the institution by doing this.” After all of the proposals were submitted, faculty, administration and senior Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) representatives convened to discuss, rank and roughly group the proposals. Since not all of the proposals can be implemented, they tried to look for  themes that could be developed into areas of focus. Proposals called for earlier academic commitment or major declaration, more COL and CSS-like programs and more graduate studies programs (in areas such as writing and film, for example). A proposal for a medical school at Long Lane was even considered. Other proposals include creating a digital library and a racial and ethnic-directed studies concentration for freshmen and sophomores.  Students were also impressed by the initiatives. “The mere fact that he recognizes activism and creativity at Wesleyan is enough for me,” said WSA member Alex Levy ’08 said. “I appreciate that. It’s unrealistic to expect sweeping changes. In six months Roth has done a lot.”  In his hopes to engage all members of the University community with these initiatives, Roth will soon be inviting both students and alumni to share their ideas for the University."
"University appoints new VP for Diversity","2008-05-02","by Rob Wohl, Staff Writer","Beginning this summer, President Michael Roth will be joined by another veteran of the California College of the Arts (CCA): Sonia BasSheva Mañjon. Dr. Mañjon will become the University’s first Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships. “I was impressed by Wesleyan’s history of diversity and the enthusiasm on the part of the students and faculty for civic engagement,” Mañjon said.  The Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships is a newly created position that will replace the Secretary of the University. The current Secretary of the University, Peter Patton, will continue in his other position as a professor of Earth & Environmental Sciences.  According to a University press release, Mañjon was hired to provide “leadership on civic engagement and cooperation with public and private organizations” and to “work with Wesleyan’s leadership team to attract, retain and inspire students, faculty and staff from groups currently under-represented on campus.” Mañjon will direct the University’s projects in the Middletown community, including the Green Street Arts Center and the Center for Community Partnerships. She will also act as the Affirmative Action Officer, oversee Public Safety and serve as a member of the president’s cabinet.  There will be some reorganization of the administration accompanying Mañjon’s arrival, but administrators indicate that, for the most part, staff will be moved into positions that are currently open. “It’s not like North College is changing dramatically,” said Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley. A committee was recently formed to assess and potentially reform student services. The committee, which includes Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Joe Bruno and Whaley will continue to meet over the summer. Other administrative changes will be announced by Whaley in the coming weeks. Mañjon was first introduced to the University when she attended President Roth’s inauguration in November. She will join the University’s administration on July 1. At CCA, Mañjon was the director of the Center for Art in Public Life and the co-chair of the College’s diversity initiatives. She characterizes the Center as similar to a combination of the University’s Green Street Arts Center and the Center for Community Partnerships. Mañjon also chaired the Diversity Studies Program and created the nation’s first BFA program in community arts. “Students look at how they as artists can make changes in society, specifically in social justice and diversity issues,” Mañjon said, explaining the community arts program.  She says this degree was created in response to a demand from students. So far the program has five graduates. However, Mañjon presently has no plans to create a similar program here at the University. “There’s a lot happening at Wesleyan already,” she said. “I’ll be meeting with various groups, including students, before I start trying to make changes to your environment.” Roth was the president of CCA while Mañjon was developing her program, and the two worked together throughout their tenure at CCA. Roth appointed Mañjon as soon as the position became open. No other candidates were considered for the position. “I am delighted to have Sonia join our efforts at Wesleyan,” Roth said in the University’s press release. “She is a tireless innovator with a very sophisticated sense of how to nurture existing relationships and create new partnerships with communities and constituencies of all sorts.”"
"Asian American Studies falls under ‘Internationalization’","2008-05-06","by Melanie Cherng,","I am writing in response to the article entitled “Roth, faculty push for Middle Eastern studies in new initiatives,” which appeared in the March 28 issue of the Argus (Volume CXLIII, Number 35), in order to address President Roth’s interests in “[doubling] the number of international students on campus, as well as [developing] a Middle Eastern Studies Program.” These initiatives are a part of the administration’s efforts to “internationalize” Wesleyan so that students are prepared to engage in a diverse, globalized world.  I applaud the administration’s desire to enact institutional change. It is refreshing. But as the administration moves forward in the next few years in implementing initiatives that will “strengthen the undergraduate experience,” “internationalize” Wesleyan, inspire a “creative campus” and “civic engagement” (see Roth’s blog entry on Trustees and Themes for the Future), I would like to remind the University that internationalizing the Wesleyan curriculum and inspiring civic engagement in the Wesleyan student body necessitates the inclusion of Asian American Studies. As the United States becomes increasingly and inextricably linked to Asia, particularly China and India in foreign and economic relations, Asian American Studies becomes particularly relevant and essential.  A look at the current global issues affecting the United States—food shortages, oil crises, terrorism, the brain drain and outsourcing—all shape American attitudes towards Asian Americans.  If there is any doubt about this, simply remember how the American government treated Japanese Americans during World War II, attitudes during the Korean and Vietnam wars and the violence inflicted upon Arab Americans and South Asian Americans (particularly Sikhs) in the aftermath of 9/11. The simple truth is that the interactions between the U.S. and Asia abroad tellingly reflect how Asian Americans are treated at home. For example, whether an Asian American is considered American or a foreign Asian has consistently fluctuated in the past with American sentiment towards Asians abroad.  As soon as considering an Asian American as a foreigner becomes a possibility, the revoking of fundamental rights guaranteed to any U.S. citizen may follow dangerously at its heels. If the concerns, histories and cultures of Asian Americans were not the concerns of the rest of the American community before, they should be now. As Americans, it is our civic duty and responsibility to be well-informed and concerned about the treatment of fellow U.S. citizens.  As an educational institution that prides itself in diversity and activism, the University should provide the time, space and resources for the student to become well-informed about all communities in the United States, including the Asian American community. Not only should the University institutionalize Asian American studies because of the undeniable contribution Asian Americans have made to U.S. history, but also because the understanding of Asian American political history and culture is fundamental to preventing policy and legislation that will negatively impact the quality of life of American citizens and residents.  Wesleyan produces bright intellectuals and social activists in every graduating class who go on to shape policy in labor, education, immigration, law, etc. In order to develop policies and services that will positively support Americans from a diverse variety of backgrounds and experiences, it is fundamental that Wesleyan students are well-informed about the histories of the communities that have shaped the U.S.—including AA communities, whose histories and experiences are a vital and essential part of American history."
"Roth reaches out in first year","2008-05-06","by Hilary Moss, Editor-in-chief","In his first year as the University’s sixteenth president, Michael Roth invigorated the Wesleyan community with a series of new initiatives, while simultaneously becoming reacquainted with his alma mater that he left 30 years ago.  “I think the most important thing I had to do this year was to get to know the Wesleyan community, and so I spent a lot of time listening to students, faculty, staff, alumni and parents, about their perception of Wesleyan today and their hopes for Wesleyan in the future,” he said. “I’ve probably had hundreds of meetings…all over the country to learn about where Wesleyan is now and what its greatest challenges are and where the opportunities lie.” One of Roth’s chief achievements was reviewing faculty input to create a series of five themes that will be implemented in the fall: strengthening the undergraduate experience, internationalization, the “creative campus,” College of the Environment and civic engagement. For the last few weeks, faculty and staff have been meeting on five committees addressing each of the topics. “They’ve all been working on identifying proposals and establishing a framework for budget planning, so by commencement I think we’ll have reports from each of these groups,” Roth explained. “University strategic planning can often take years. We tried to do it in a more focused, quicker way, and I’m delighted it’s gone as well as it has.” Roth said that he also hopes to enhance the co-curricular components of student life. Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley and Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Joe Bruno have been discussing ways to connect academics with activities outside of the classroom. “It has been stimulating to work with [Roth] because he has a range of ideas, but is very willing to listen to the ideas of others,” Bruno said. “He also applies a healthy skepticism to conversations of this type, because he wants to understand proposals fully and to know that the speaker has thought carefully about his or her ideas.” In perhaps what is his most significant initiative, Roth announced in November that beginning with the class of 2012, first-year students whose total family income is less than $40,000 per year will receive grants as opposed to loans. All other students on financial aid will graduate with a four-year total loan indebtedness reduced by an average of 35 percent. This will cost the university $3.2 million each year. According to Roth, more students are matriculating who need financial aid.  “In a sense, that’s good because they see Wesleyan as giving robust financial aid and that’s what we were hoping for,” he said. “Fundraising for it is coming along nicely, but there’s a lot more to do. For a school with our size endowment, in order to do that kind of financial aid, we really need to continue to grow our endowment so we can continue giving to students in the future.” Director of Financial Aid Jennifer Lawton said that Roth’s new loan initiative has received strong support from alums, the Board of Trustees and donors. “The hope is to reduce packaged loan debt even more in the future and with the interest shown by donors, I think this will become a reality,” she said.  Roth has also focused his energies on fundraising, especially for the endowment. “With turmoil in financial markets it’s been a difficult year for a lot of people,” he said. “I think the plan from the Board [of Trustee]’s perspective was that in the first year of a president’s tenure you don’t want to have to depend on the president to raise a lot of money from big donors. After all, he or she doesn’t know them yet, but in this case we had to raise money because we needed it for both financial aid and for the facilities projects.” He said that so far the University has received several million-dollar gifts from first-time donors, although the total amount made through fundraising cannot be reported until the end of the fiscal year.  A bulk of the fundraising money will also go to the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, to be housed in the former Davision Campus Center building and slated to open in the fall of 2009, and the new Molecular Life and Sciences complex, which is tentatively projected for completion in 2015. As part of watching the University’s cash flow, Roth also asked each of his administrative officials to cut his or her department’s budget. “I think when you spend money it should be very clearly connected to education and the further away it gets from education, teaching and scholarship, the harder it is to justify the expenditure,” Roth said. “I asked each cabinet member to reduce the budget in their area. We didn’t make all of the cuts. We want to make the ones that don’t have an impact on education.” Wesleyan Student Assembly President Matt Ball ’08 thinks Roth has also made an impact by increasing the visibility of the president on campus. “Students have a personal relationship with him and feel like they can relate to him in a way that’s quite rare on college campuses,” Ball said. “There are obviously other more concrete things, but to me his most notable achievement is his responsiveness.” Roth noted that although he travels during the weekends, he typically spends a lot of time on campus.  “Going to lots of stuff on campus has been exciting,” he said. “I’m just trying to be more open through office hours and the blog, answering e-mails and meeting people outside of office hours. I want to give Wesleyan students the feeling that they can talk to the president about issues that matter to them.” Roth could also be seen in the classroom this year as the professor of a Film Studies’ course “The Past on Film.” “Teaching has been a delight,” he said. “I’ve enjoyed it tremendously.” Next year, Roth will continue to keep his office door open, garnering more input from members of the University community. He also hopes to become a better communicator. “Sometimes I speak informally,” he said. “I suppose I should be more prudent.” Vice President and Secretary of the University Peter Patton expressed that it is important to remember that it is Roth’s first year in the position. “He’s going to be a great Wesleyan president…I think he’s accessible and willing to engage in conversation with everybody about everything,” Patton said. “He is passionate about Wesleyan and its mission and he’s just getting started. It takes a while to get under way here. His major accomplishments will be in upcoming years.“"
"Budgetary constraints threaten NY Times readership program","2008-09-19","by Katherine Yagle, Contributing Writer","Due to the recent increase in the price of the New York Time—rom 30 to 45 cents per university cop—unding for the Wesleyan Readership Program is slated to run out early next semester. The program, which was started nearly nine years ago, distributes free copies of the paper across campus Monday through Friday.  The New York Times Readership Program offers a discounted subscription to educational institutions that wish to provide copies of the paper to students. For the past few years, the Organization and External Affairs Committee (OEAC) of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) has brought 700 copies of the Times to campus five days a week at the price of 30 cents each. Annually, such distribution cost a total of $25,000, with $15,000 being paid by the WSA, $6,000 by the Office of Academic Affairs, and $4,000 by the Office of Student Affairs.  “This is a partnership between the WSA and the administration,” said WSA Vice President Saul Carlin ’09. “It benefits the entire community.” Last year, David Booth, manager of the New York Times Readership Program, alerted former WSA Vice President Emily Malkin ’08 that the price would increase to 45 cents per copy—a 50 percent increase—over two semesters. As a result, the annual cost of the program increased to $41,650.  Last semester, when the transition price of 40 cents per copy went into effect, the OEAC reduced the number of copies delivered daily to 600 in order to meet the annual $25,000 budget.  “Almost half the papers that are picked up are picked up in Exley,” Carlin said. “A lot of professors are picking these up, and a lot of professors like the idea of their students reading the New York Times every day.”  With that in mind, Malkin began reaching out to various academic departments in order to seek funding to continue the program. However, when the WSA approached the departments, the Office of Academic Affairs decided that their contribution to the program would function as an umbrella contribution from all academic departments, thus eliminating any extra funding the WSA had hoped to receive. In order to continue the program, the OEAC proposed a proportional contribution increase: the WSA, the Office of Student Affairs, and the Office of Academic Affairs would each increase their funding by 43 percent. Additionally, the students approached the Office of Admission for funding assistance. OEAC’s proposal suggested that the WSA contribute $21,500, the Office of Student Affairs contribute $5,700, the Office of Academic Affairs contribute $8,600, and the Office of Admission contribute $6,000.  Dean of Students Rick Culliton vetoed the proposed funding increase.  “We are in the midst of a five-year review of our budgets, trying to make reductions across the University,” said Culliton. “In looking at our own budgets and needing to make reductions, [the New York Times Readership Program] is a very nice thing to have on campus, but in our view it’s not something that is essential.” Dean of Admission Nancy Meislahn was unable to accept the WSA’s proposal, due to the present policy that the Office of Admission only provide funding to activities that are directly related the office, not to student activities.  “I believe that the New York Times Readership Program is a fantastic admissions tool,” Carlin said. “ I remember when I was visiting as a pre-frosh, I was on a balcony looking down on people eating and I saw half the tables with New York Times papers spread open and students reading and discussing what was going on. The WSA believes that the program is directly related to Admissions. We have prospective students coming here and seeing what I saw. The whole community benefits from this civic engagement that happens when people can pick up a copy of the New York Times, sit around a table in Usdan or in Pi, read what’s going on, and talk about it.” The OEAC currently faces a rapidly depleting fund, even with the decreased number of papers being delivered.  “It’s not that Admission didn’t want to [fund the program], it’s not that Dean Rick didn’t want to do it, it’s that the administration doesn’t want to do it. It’s that wherever we go, there seems to be an assumption that the WSA can foot the bill all on our own, and we can’t,” Carlin said.  The students are continuing to make their case to the administration and seek a proportional increase in funding.  However, unless an agreement is reached, the fund will run out sometime in early spring—effectively ending the Readership Program.  “It’s not that anyone in Student Affairs doesn’t think the program is a nice thing to have on campus,” said Culliton. “It’s just that at this point, as we look at tight budgets, it’s harder to justify that.” Carlin hopes that a sense of urgency as the deadline nears will encourage members of the Wesleyan administration to agree to funding increases.  “Holding a paper in your hands is a completely different experience than reading the news online,” he said. “To lose that experience on this campus would be a real tragedy.”"
"WesVotes promotes student registration","2008-09-19","by Meredith Rogerson, Contributing Writer","A team of students and administrators finalized plans last week to institute WesVotes, a partnership between the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) and various administrative offices aimed at aiding students in the registration and voting processes. The program, currently led by a bipartisan group of University students, represents a major step towards increasing voter turnout within the campus community. The program’s mission is two-fold: one, to raise awareness among the student body about civic engagement; and two, to facilitate both the registration and voting processes for University students. Both the Office of Residential Life (ResLife) and the Office of the University Registrar have worked closely with students to make the program a reality.  The program itself was a direct reaction to poor turnout of college-age voters in past elections, said Chris Goy ’09, former president of the Wesleyan Democrats and the main organizer of WesVotes.   “There are may people who become disenfranchised by being in college,” said Goy, who attributes this to students’ busy schedules and the fact that many of them are from out-of-state.  Goy also notes that voters between the ages of 18 and 24 make up a substantial segment of the country’s population.  “The fact that [this portion] of the population is underrepresented is shameful,” said Goy. Thanks to the Registrar’s Office, students can now find a link to DeclareYourself.org at the top of their Electronic Portfolios, where they can register to vote, request absentee ballots, and view information about voting and the election process. With the help of ResLife, students can also register to vote or obtain an absentee ballot through a WesVotes representative who lives in their residence hall. This makes the program especially helpful for students who do not wish to vote in the state of Connecticut.   “We have asked each RA to identify a Hall Captain,” said Director of Residential Life Fran Koerting in an email. “Hall Captains will discuss voter registration with their neighbors and assist each person individually to register to vote or request an absentee ballot.”  For students who will be voting in Middletown on Nov. 4, the WesVotes team has coordinated with the Office of Community Service to make both registration and voting as simple as possible.  “Students can drop off their registration cards at a designated drop box at WesStation, where we will collect them and deliver them to City Hall,” said Director of Community Service and Volunteerism Cathy Crimmins Lechowicz. “The [Center for Community Partnerships] will also provide transportation on the day of the election to transport students to their designated polling station.” She added that vans would be leaving roughly every half-hour from the Usdan University Center on Election Day. WesVotes has no plans to stop its services once the upcoming election has passed.  “The purpose is to create a system of institutionalized voter registration,” said Goy, who shares this vision of the program’s endurance with Director of Student Activities and Leadership Development Tim Shiner. Shiner, whose office has been active in the establishment of the WesVotes program, believes that it is an important addition to the Wesleyan community.  “My hope is that having a central group of students which brings together the various stakeholders will…assist in sparking greater civic engagement in the student body and the larger community,” he said. “I hope to work with the students involved from year to year to provide continuity in their efforts.” Many students agree that WesVotes is a welcome addition to the University, especially since the program caters to the student who has a full schedule and would therefore be less inclined to vote. “Almost everyone knows what’s going on in the election,” said Sam Hecht ’12. “But for most people there’s just no motivation. It would really help a lot if students could vote from their dorm rooms.”  “Wesleyan students don’t need a hand-out,” said Goy, “but they do deserve the right information.”"
"Mytheology: The Wages of Immaturity","2008-09-30","by Mytheos Holt, Columnist","“All grandeur, all power, all subordination rest on the executioner. He is the horror and bond of human association; remove this incomprehensible agent from the world, and at that very instant order gives way to chaos, thrones topple and society disappears.” -Comte Joseph de Maistre It is an oft-remarked fact that Wesleyan students dislike external control. Indeed, if one looked back through the issues of this noble paper, one would probably find that the majority of angry Wespeaks are written in response to some abuse of authority, either real or imagined, whether it is perpetrated by the Wesleyan administration, the faculty, the Bon Appetit staff, Public Safety, the Middletown Police or even the laws of economics. A visitor who used these articles as an indicator of the prevailing weltanschauung at Wesleyan would probably come to the conclusion that if this campus believes in anything, it believes in questioning authority. That is, unless you question the implicit moral authority of those who question, in which case you’re a reactionary who has to be silenced. But let’s not mince words. It is no surprise, therefore, that even when Wesleyan students exercise authority against other Wesleyan students, it is defied. There is no clearer example of this tendency than the article in Friday’s Argus (“Insult to injury: Failure to Comply stats rise,” Sept. 26, 2008, Volume CXLIV, Number 8), which discussed the overwhelming tide of Failure to Comply violations on this campus. Most students have never met a form of authority they couldn’t blow off with relative impunity, and it is understandably galling to them that the Student Judicial Board (SJB) refuses to be so flippantly treated. It is quite admirable that the SJB is standing firm on this matter, not only because it may finally expunge the prevailing prepubescent attitude that all authority is meaningless, but also because this exercise of unassailable power may actually provoke a discussion about the responsibilities associated with said power. Spiderman’s axiom about the relation between these two concepts desperately needs yet one more historical illustration. Now, there’s no disputing that the SJB has a tough time convincing students of its capacity to be efficacious. It is widely perceived as the guardian of such unenforceable measures as the chalking ban and the underage drinking ban. Being charged with enforcing such measures is utter poison for any judicial authority that wants to be perceived as such, and the SJB is not perceived as such, largely due to the aforementioned immature attitude among students that all authority is useless. However, far from being the libratory ethos which most of Wesleyan’s armchair anarchists believe it to be, this attitude actually provides cover for a few powers which the SJB does possess and which, if the students actually took the time to pay attention, might alarm them terribly. The most prominent example of this sort of power is the SJB’s charge to enforce Wesleyan’s Speech Code. The Orwellian name of this document is not accidental—it is nothing less than a document regulating what students can and cannot say without serious consequences, and if you actually take the time to read the document, you find that we can say very little indeed. For instance, the passage detailing what “Discriminatory Harassment” is defines its subject as follows: “Discriminatory harassment may include any action or statement intended to insult, stigmatize, or degrade an individual or group on the basis of […] race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, national or ethnic origin, veteran status, or any other basis protected by local, state or federal law in any activity administered by the University.” Now, depending on who sits on the SJB, these words could mean practically anything and we’d have no concrete legal way of constraining them from deciding that one remark is hate speech one year and then is not hate speech the following year. In fact, it’s precisely because of passages like this that the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) gave Wesleyan a speech code rating of Red, the worst rating possible, according to its website www.thefire.org. Mind you, nobody ever bothers to contest this sort of abusive and vague language because nobody believes the SJB has any power, and so they never pay attention to it.  More fundamentally, the attitude toward authority at Wesleyan misunderstands a fundamental element in the dialectic between authority and liberty—implicit in any persuasive criticism of authority is the idea that, were it not for a particular flawed abuse, the criticizer would obey the authority. Otherwise, the authority will believe there’s no pleasing the criticizer, and will be happy to bash his skull against the pavement. This is not a positive outcome for an authority figure, or that authority figure’s subjects. Civic engagement is much more productive; but civic engagement requires the pesky notion that there is an authoritative civic entity with which to engage.  Most Wesleyan students aren’t willing to accept this notion, naturally, which is why the SJB ought to keep enforcing those Failure to Comply violations, ruthlessly if necessary. They should do anything necessary to make this campus realize the necessity of loosening the grip of the administration’s iron fist through legitimate, respectful means. Of course, that may be impossible, as most students seem to prefer idly thumb-wrestling with it."
"Argus: Is Prison a Theme Park?","2009-02-03","by Anna Wiener,","To the Editors of the Wesleyan Argus, Your editorial published on January 30, titled “Prison Experiment Is a Worthy One,” (Volume CXLV, Number 1) was well-intentioned but horribly misguided. Instead of providing support for an important and worthwhile campus initiative, you instead propagated a hateful, ignorant attitude toward incarcerated individuals. On top of that, you revealed yourselves to be navel-gazing and self-important, as well as wholly incapable of throwing your weight behind a project that, for once, does not place Wesleyan students on a golden pedestal. I’ll spare you an indictment of the egregious cartoon you published alongside your editorial, which single-handedly managed to be wildly offensive and casually align prisoners with Nazism (for those who missed this allusion: check out the swastika forehead tattoo). For these reasons, among others that I will outline shortly, it makes me deeply uncomfortable that you are in any position to represent Wesleyan’s student body. First of all, the project (not “experiment”) at the center of your editorial is not called the “Prison Solidarity Project.” It is the Prisoner Solidarity Project (PSP). Take a moment to reflect on the great disparity between these two meanings. Additionally, the fact that you published the name of the project incorrectly suggests that you did not even read the 1.5-page proposal issued by the PSP at last Monday’s symposium. Had you done the bare minimum required of any middling (perhaps aspiring?) journalist, you would have been able to correct your own glaring inconsistencies before allowing them to go to press. To address the meat of your argument point by point, let me begin by repeating a question you pose as one of your “ethical concerns:” “would Wesleyan want to sanction a program that provides inmates with such enormous benefits?” This question essentially asks whether or not incarcerated individuals are deserving of a college-level education. (What an “ethical concern” indeed!) You suggest that excluding the prison population from educational opportunities represents an ethical stance. Given the demographics of the prison population, it is safe to say that certain populations (poor, male, black, Latino) are systematically filtered into the prison system. You are therefore implying that these populations–both in and outside of prison–are undeserving of the same educational opportunities available to those enrolled in an institution like Wesleyan (which, coincidentally, happens to be private, expensive, and around 70 percent white). Adding insult to injury, you later state–with the naïve goodwill of a 17th century missionary–that you believe “the program will have a much greater impact if students, not just professors, get a chance to teach the incarcerated.” (“Get a chance” – really? Is prison a theme park?) Why do you believe this? What makes you think Wesleyan undergraduates are in any way qualified to teach college courses? Either way you slice it, this intimation is a slap in the face to Wesleyan professors, and an insult to those incarcerated. The PSP’s proposal to create a Center for Prison Education would further Wesleyan’s dual commitments to civic engagement and progressive education. Shame on you, Wesleyan Argus, for your painfully counter-productive contribution to this discussion."
"Wesleyan Center for Prison Education: Informal Proposal","2009-02-03","by Russell Perkins, on behalf of the Prisoner Solidarity Project","After many years of prisoner advocacy work by Wesleyan students and faculty, including the facilitation of academic workshops in two Connecticut correctional facilities, we propose the establishment of the Wesleyan Center for Prison Education.   The Center’s Plan: Two-Year College-in-Prison pilot program to be run in collaboration with Cheshire Correctional Institution.  Wesleyan Education at Cheshire: 15 inmates will be selected through a rigorous admission process to participate during the first year of the pilot program. Each student will enroll in 2 courses per semester. Courses will be taught by Wesleyan faculty. After two semesters, an additional 15 students will be admitted to the pilot program, producing a total of 30 program participants and 4 courses taught each semester. One transferable undergraduate credit will be awarded upon successful completion of each course. Prison Education at Wesleyan: A POI “Critical Pedagogy” service-learning seminar will be taught at Wesleyan in the fall semester. This course will involve a practicum component in which Wesleyan students tutor inmates that have not yet been accepted into the program. In addition to assisting participants to develop the essential capabilities that will prepare them for enrollment in credit-bearing courses, this component will aim to establish a mutually productive dialogue between Wesleyan students and those incarcerated. This program will be fully funded by private donors not currently drawn upon by Wesleyan University. Because of a conditional commitment from one such source, we are confident that funding will not jeopardize this program. The Center’s Mission: To practice Wesleyan’s commitment to civic engagement by offering college courses to incarcerated individuals, in order to enhance both Wesleyan’s academic community and the lives of those who are systematically denied access to educational opportunities. We believe that educational opportunity should be a fundamental right and recognize that a college education enables effective citizenship. As Wilbur Fisk wrote in 1831 and Wesleyan’s 2005 strategic plan reaffirmed, education serves two purposes: “the good of the individual educated and the good of the world.” This program embodies this core Wesleyan value and will demonstrate Wesleyan’s commitment to quality education, intellectual development and civic engagement.  We hope that you will support this potentially groundbreaking College-in-Prison program. If you have any questions or comments please email: WesleyanPrisonEducation@gmail.com."
"Two Years In, Roth Looks Back","2009-05-05","by Katherine Yagle, Assistant News Editor","Argus: What do you feel you have accomplished in the face of the recession over these past two years? President Michael Roth: I think balancing the budget this year and creating a plan for long term sustainability has been a joint accomplishment of the faculty, students, trustees and staff. I was proud to lead that effort and try to bring our spending in relation to our resources. Being more prudent about our capital expenditures last year and this year has been very important. We have improved financial aid, reducing student indebtedness by 35 percent overall. The economy has prevented us from making as much progress as I’d hoped in many areas because we’ve been working on balancing the budget. I’ve spent a lot of time consulting with different constituencies, making sure we have enough to money to get through tough times. A: What are your goals for the future? MR: I would like to see Wesleyan become confident in its distinctiveness, sure of itself as a leader in American higher education, and articulate in expressing what we stand for. There are seven areas that have been the most important points of focus. The first is enhanced financial aid—when I first started we immediately changed the financial aid program to make it more generous to our neediest student, which I think is very important especially in light of the current recession. The second goal is investment in the sciences. We’ve postponed a major capital expense for our  new science building but we still need to invest in the sciences—and in people and in equipment. As the economy improves, I think we’ll be able to start doing just that. The third area is called curricular reform; I’ve focused on the first year and last year. I would like to see the first year experience to be much more of a cohort-building threshold experience, providing students with the sense that they’re in a different kind of place—some place unlike wherever they’ve studied before. The other thing I’ve mentioned is a senior capstone experience; eventually I’d like to see everybody graduating from Wesleyan accomplishing an independent project of some kind—not necessarily a scholarly thesis, but some kind of independent project to serve as a transition between Wesleyan and whatever comes next. The fourth goal is internationalization. Wesleyan has had approximately seven percent of its students from outside the US; I’d like to see that doubled over several years. I also want to make sure the curriculum is as international and cosmopolitan as possible. It has to be a faculty-led process whereby we examine each sector of the curriculum to ensure that the education our students are getting what prepares them to be global citizens, not just members of the US economy and culture. The next two areas are things people have long said about Wesleyan students that I’m not convinced we have anchored in our curriculum. The first is that we’re an activist bunch, with a lot of politics on campus. Rather than try to run away from that image, I think we should embrace it. Wes students should learn how to be more effective neighbors and citizens, more effective at civic engagement because of their time on campus. The other thing people say about Wesleyan students is that we’re a creative bunch. I want to make sure that creativity is actually an innovation, plugged into the curriculum, so that it’s not just for the studio art majors but something that is accessible for everyone. In every department, there are ways I believe we can help people become more creative or at least be more aware of the creative possibilites. The last area is the College of the Environment, which we’ve taken a big step towards an obligatory linked major, which has just been approved by the faculty. Eventually, I’d like that to become our new College of the Environment. We have the College of Social Studies and the College of Letters, both of which are celebrating their 50th anniversaries. It’s the perfect time to start the College of the Environment. All of these are attempts to take what Wesleyan students stand for and to try to make us better and more serious about those things. It’s important for the President to talk about these initiatives in the public sphere, and so I’ve spent a fair amount of time trying to share what Wesleyan stands for, traveling around the country meeting with alumni, giving speeches, and writing for the Huffington Post and the Los Angeles Times. A: In what ways has Wesleyan changed since you were a student? MR: I think there’s a spirit at Wesleyan that’s remained strong. This sense of practical idealism, of people who have great ambition and dream big but learn to acquire skills that allow them to operate in the world and to make stuff happen—this was characteristic of Wesleyan in the seventies and is still so. Things that have changed…the role of parents has changed enormously since I was a student. My parents heard from me once a week—now there are students who call their parents before they call their advisor. I don’t think it’s a sign of the strength of the family, but a sign that people are not allowed to grow up. Parents are concerned and parents are often paying, but the fact is that students are adults. But this isn’t a Wesleyan change—it’s a national change. Wesleyan has a lot more school spirit now than when I was a student, and I think that’s a good thing. I belonged to Alpha Delta Phi and I was very involved with the activities of the fraternity but I’d never heard the fight song—I didn’t even know there was a fight song! Wesleyan students sing it not so much with irony as with glee. Of course, part of the student culture is oppositional and that’s also a very good thing, but I think we express our school spirit more freely today than in the past. A: What was your experience at Wesleyan like? MR: I was involved in some political things but I was very serious about my studies. I was only here three years so I had a lot to do quickly. I worked in the kitchen at Alpha Delt, so I was there late at night and early in the morning. I wanted to be a writer so I wrote short stories and poetry, some of which were published in Hermes. I volunteered in a hospital psychiatric ward, I tutored an elementary school kid, I was a senior interviewer, I was a T.A. in psychology. Now that I think about it, I wonder how I had the time, but there were just so many interesting things to do. A: What does Wesleyan stand for to you? MR: This is what I hope to be talking about with students and faculty over the next year. To me, Wesleyan represents a progressive liberal arts education, meaning that it’s a leader in higher education and that other people follow what we do. I suppose one way to think about Wesleyan’s future is that we want to be a better school, richer, more selective, but that’s boring to me. Wesleyan isn’t just another liberal arts college that’s hard to get into. We have stood for something special, for creativity, for political engagement, for a research-oriented curriculum. These are qualities to build on in the future. A: What do you think are the greatest challenges going into next year? MR: There are still great economic challenges to giving people the resources they need to be great at what they do. There are cultural challenges in getting people to think: “What does the University as a whole stand for?” Sometimes it’s very hard for someone in one field to talk to someone in another, so we have to find ways of bridging that. I disagree with anyone who says we should just be a small teaching school. At Wesleyan, our teaching is great because our research is deep. Research shouldn’t isolate us—it should give us more ways of linking to one another.  A: What plans do you have to address the budgetary crisis in the future? MR: I would like to see Wesleyan much more economically secure than we are today. The short term goal is to put spending in line with resources, which we’ve almost done. The long term goal is to increase economic capacity so that we know that the important things are here to stay. I would like to see a much larger portion of the financial aid program endowed, so at the next campaign I hope to raise a couple hundred million dollars. It’s not just about raising money to spend in a year, but saving and investing so that over time our financial aid program will be secure. We have created emergency funds through cost-cutting and we have tried to show our donors that we are responsible and creative stewards of generosity. A lot of what I’ve talked about—the core values, what we stand for—are  good in themselves but if we do them well we will also inspire generosity. Communication about these values and programs is really important; we need more people around the world to know that we have something very special at this university. A: Overall, what are your feelings about your first two years as president? MR: I’m not satisfied. There are things I’m proud of, I’ve made some mistakes, I joke around a lot and sometimes say things I shouldn’t say. As President, I want to show respect for all members of the Wesleyan community. I think I can do more to help the University realize its potential and I think I have to be an even better listener. As you can see, I like to talk, but I really want to be a good listener so I can understand what students, alumni, faculty, trustees, and staff think about where we’re going. The more I can understand other points of view, the more effective I’ll be as a leader."
"Mytheology (Wesleyan Viewed From the Right…and the West Coast): A Joint Partnership","2009-12-26","by Mytheos Holt, Ancient Conserva-Blarger","Author’s Note: Observing the current controversy over the election of Mr. Giant Joint, it has become immediately apparent to me that a brief exit from my Winter Break oasis of literary isolation in the California hills is not only appropriate, but essential. Though my original plan had been to leave the topic for my first column of the second semester, it is important to strike while the iron is hot, or, to use a more apt metaphor, to inhale while the joint is still lit, so I will make one exception to my “no columns during breaks” rule and submit this. This Christmas morning, fresh from a lovely and long sleep on West Coast time, I awoke to find a precious gift waiting under the tree – a first edition, signed copy of H.L. Mencken’s Notes on Democracy, a document which contains many exceedingly well-taken insights on the peculiar American political neurosis of which the title speaks. Mr. Mencken observes, for instance, that “Democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage.” Harsh though this statement is, I must admit to feeling a sort of ghoulish joy upon reading it, given the context of the election of a Mr. Giant Joint to the Wesleyan Student Assembly. Before proceeding with this column, however, let me take the time to congratulate Mr. Joint on his victory after so many soul-crushing defeats, and also to assure him that I bear him no ill will whatsoever for besting me in the 2010 Class Representative election of a few years ago. If one proposes to try to stand in the way of history, one must be prepared to get crushed occasionally (much as Alan Keyes did when he attempted to stop the juggernaut known as Barack Obama), and I am confident that trying to compete with Mr. Joint is one such case (not to mention I am sure that he will make for an infinitely wiser legislator than Mr. Obama). However, it appears that, in a true example of politically motivated cruelty, many of my peers have begun trying to wrest Mr. Joint’s victory from him before he can properly enjoy it. They raise such superfluous objections as the idea that Mr. Joint is not a Wesleyan student (an utterly moot point, given that I suspect these same people voted for President Obama, who, as we all know from his speeches, professes to be a citizen of the world rather than the United States), and also that his election “degrades” the WSA. Ironically, I find myself in complete agreement with this latter charge (though perhaps not with its terminology), yet this is one reason why I think Mr. Joint’s seating is not only necessary, but that to do otherwise would constitute a severe miscarriage of justice. Mr. Joint emphatically should be seated – not as a monument to the joyful success of Democracy, but as a living, breathing, smoking symbol of its inevitable teleological descent into mediocrity and apathetic, puerile childishness, at the dreadful point where civic engagement has become nothing but a postmodern practical joke. Not merely that, but his solemnly wafting presence in the halls of power should serve as a powerful reminder to the WSA itself of its own complete irrelevance, and the fire of his sizzling, contraband conviction should amply achieve the valuable task of puncturing the slowly swelling balloon of insular self-importance which pervades that institution. Practiced readers of this column will have to forgive the cynicism of my old age, but the recent uselessness of the WSA over my four years here is a topic which has been scandalously ignored, to the detriment of Wesleyan students everywhere. If nothing else, Mr. Joint has done us all a service by bring it to the fore, and exposing these self-important elections for the sham that they are – every year, a portion of our parents’ hard-earned tuition money, or of our much pleaded for student loans, or in some cases of our own money gets poured into the WSA, with the express purpose of funding student activities, student government, and some variant thereof. The WSA is even given its own office within Usdan, as though it were an arm of the administration (which at times, it may as well be). And what does the WSA do with its hallowed money and its specifically allocated office in Usdan, besides supply us with a convenient free photocopier, red-stamping Michael Roth’s rampage through our endowment, caving to insane protestors calling for the university to mortgage its future in the name of some nebulously defined abstraction known only by the saccharine name of “social responsibility” and allowing the smarmiest members of the exact same groups on-campus to bolster their resumes year after year? What they do is waste our money on pointless new committees, squander it by creating new “funds” with socially conscious names and then by asking us to approve them in costly elections ex post facto, violating the rules they write for themselves and then changing those after the fact, and generally allow a collection of shamelessly amateurish politicos to cut their pork barrel teeth squabbling over a pot of forcefully expropriated money! And let’s not forget telling us to respect organizations designed to trample all over every Western notion of due process with Orwellian “speech codes” and bizarre rulings! Unfair? Perhaps, but harsh though my assessment may be of the reasons for the WSA’s farcical perception among the student population, one cannot deny that the perception exists, given the election of Mr. Joint. To be sure, part of the problem is the general apathy and childishness of a student body for whom posts on the ACB constitute meaningful political discourse, but let us confine ourselves to problems we can actually solve. I, for one, do not think that students find it easy to view the WSA elections with any sort of dignity at all at the point where many candidacy statements – especially the ones which, God forbid, try to be funny – are such an affront to our intelligence. In any case, Mr. Joint’s election should be respected as the exercise in legitimate, commonplace Democratic decision-making that it is. If nothing else, it will save the members of the WSA the trouble of indulging their tastes for illicit substances outside the conference room, and perhaps – just perhaps – Mr. Joint’s tenure will be sufficiently unimpressive, and the WSA’s performance will be that much improved, that students can be induced to give a damn about his seat again. In the meantime, Mr. Joint should remain elected as a warning to all members of the WSA currently serving that there, but for the grace of God, incumbency and devoted friends go they.                 \r       \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\tAbout Ezra Silk\r       \t\t\t\t\tI have been interested in journalism ever since I was an editor at my high school student newspaper, where I was involved in a freedom of speech controversy that was covered in the local newspaper as well as local television and radio outlets.

"New Certificate To Encourge Civic Engagement Among Students","2010-02-12","by Amanda Schwartz, News Editor","From service-learning courses suchas Activism and Outreach Through Theater to tutoring programs at Middletown schools, Wesleyan provides students many opportunities to get involved outside the Ivory Tower. On Jan. 29, however, a joint faculty and staff committee submitted a proposal that would make the University’s commitment to community service official. A new Civic Engagement Certificate (CEC) is currently being reviewed by the Educational Policy Committee (EPC), which consists of two WSA members, six faculty members, and Provost Joseph Bruno. If approved, the certificate will appear on WesMaps, the University’s course catalog, next fall. “This allows students who are involved in different forms of civic engagement at Wesleyan to tie them all together into a coherent program with an academic component,” said Civic Engagement Committee member and Sociology Professor Rob Rosenthal. If approved, the certificate would be available to members of the class of 2013 and subsequent classes. According to the proposal, students will not have to fulfill any requirements before applying to the CEC. The proposed program would have a range of requirements starting with a foundation course geared towards sophomores interested in pursuing the certificate. Tentatively scheduled to be taught by Rosenthal next fall, the course would present civic engagement from a historical perspective and analyze its significance. In addition to the gateway course, students would need to take five other civic engagement courses. The proposal lists courses offered during the 2009-2010 academic year that theoretically could meet that requirement including Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems, an Earth and Environmental Science course, Physics for Future Presidents, a Physics course, and Sociology of Economic Change: Latin American Responses to Global Capitalism, a course in the Sociology Department. Outside of the classroom, students would need to complete two or more semesters of service work through the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism (OCS), in addition to an internship that could be done either during the academic year or over the summer. “We want students to have some practical experience,” said Civic Engagement Committee Chair and Service Learning Center Director Professor Suzanne O’Connell. In their senior year, students would take a senior seminar capstone course to complete the certificate. The capstone course, which would not be offered until the current freshmen are seniors, would require students to work together on a larger project focusing on civic engagement at Wesleyan. “We want the CEC students to be a cohort,” O’Connell said. “Students that are spending time together, working together, and talking about civic engagement.” President Michael Roth approved the Civic Engagement Committee in the 2007-2008 academic year in order to establish a stronger niche for civic engagement at the University. “The effort to develop a certificate in civic engagement is coming from faculty,” Roth said. “I’m really supportive of it. I’ve been talking about Wesleyan and civic engagement and politically-active students since I returned to Wesleyan and people had been talking about it long before I came.” The committee, composed of Associate Provost Karen Anderson, Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) Director Frank Kuan, Director of Community Service and Volunteering Cathy Lechowicz, Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships Sonja Mañjon, Government Professor Don Moon, Director of Strategic Initiatives Charles Salas, Career Resource Center Director Michael Sciola, Rosenthal, and O’Connell, began developing a comprehensive program that originally included not only a certificate, but also hiring a new faculty member, funding for student internships, and extensive plans for community work with Long Lane Farm. “We planned a very elaborate, expensive program with multiple parts,  new professors, internships, but then the bottom fell out of the economy,” O’Connell said. “To save on the important components  we pared the CEC down to what we could do with no money. It’s still a fabulous endeavor and that’s the civic engagement proposal that’s gone to the EPC.” If the CEC is approved, a panel consisting of the Director of the Service Learning Center, the Director of Community Service and Volunteerism, the Director of Community Relations, and two other faculty members will administer the certificate. “We’re pretty much ready,” Rosenthal said. “It’s a work in progress, but I think the thing to do is to get it going through this gateway course and the formation of a committee that would be watching how it develops over the next couple years.” In December, Kathlyn Pattillo ’12 attended a meeting to give student input on the proposal. “My feeling is that they haven’t got very much student input,” Pattillo said. “And I voiced that in the meeting. I feel like moving forward they need to get students involved in the committee.” According to both Rosenthal and O’Connell, input from faculty and staff influenced the initial formation of the certificate far more than ideas from students. However, if the proposal is approved, ideas from students will take on a greater role in future development. “Once we figure out how the program goes, students will be involved in working to shape it,” O’Connell said. Regardless, Pattillo said she is pleased that the University is giving service-learning and civic engagement greater priority in academics. “I think it’s really great that the University is placing such an emphasis on service-learning,” Pattillo said. “Tufts has a major emphasis on public service already. I think this is a really positive step in that direction.” While the proposal was organized by staff and faculty, Rosenthal said the motivation came from students. “Just from students themselves, there’s a real desire for putting the whole thing together and thinking through issues: ethical questions, questions of the individual,” Rosenthal added. “These are things that are covered from time to time in different classes. The certificate program will allow [students] to engage [these things] in a body of thought.”"
"Three Years In, Roth Looks Back","2010-05-04","by Jae Aron, Alison Cies, Editors-in-Chief","Argus: Do you think anything has changed about Wesleyan since you took over? President Roth: On the infrastructure side, there’s been a greater focus on economics and fiscal discipline, and there is a much greater emphasis on the long-term economic growth of the institution. There’s been a greater focus on what is distinctive about the Wesleyan educational experience. Over these past few years, I’ve been having conversations with faculty, students, and alumni about not just how strong we are as a school but what is particular about the Wesleyan educational experience that we cherish and want to preserve for future generations. That has allowed us to make some significant changes on the academic side, co-curricular side, and in the way we talk to alumni. Instead of celebrating the success and the strengths of the school, which we try to tease out from our own experiences of Wesleyan, we have been trying to look at what we think is characteristic of the personality of the institution and to strengthen these areas, such as creativity and political engagement. We’re trying to define how liberal arts can be made relevant to culture and society. I think we’ve made some progress as a result of those conversations. Here are a few examples: we’ve created the College of the Environment, we’ve enhanced our ability to do work in the community, and we’ve worked to make diversity not just a slogan but a more meaningful experience for Wesleyan students. We’ve also really worked on the way we do admissions and to try to celebrate what’s “Wesleyan-ish” about the place. A: Throughout your three years as President, you have introduced new ideas, new plans, and new ways of running the University. What are your goals for the future and is there a larger vision driving these changes? PR: We’ve had a series of conversations with student leaders, faculty, students, and alumni about the overarching goals of the Wesleyan 2020 plan. I hope the things I’ve articulated in that document build on the progressive legacy of the Butterfield years. Although we’ve set up the COE and the Center for the Study of Public Life during the year marking the fiftieth anniversary of the College of Letters, the College of Social Studies and the Center for the Humanities, I do think there’s a lot more than can be done. The vision is to champion curricular reform that enlivens the liberal arts while making it relevant to culture, society, and the economy, and promoting access to the institution from diverse quarters. In that regard I’ve emphasized   geographic diversity in addition to racial and ethnic diversity. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what Wesleyan stands for. In our history as a university we have taken stands that are progressive, and we know that because others have followed us. There’s a whole range of places where Wesleyan is an intellectual pioneer. Part of the vision I have for Wesleyan is that we should strive to always be pioneers. This will mean that sometimes we will fall into a trap or make a mistake because we have to take risks. That’s something about Wesleyan students, that they do take risks. Sometimes they fall, but it’s such a compassionate community that when people do fall, someone usually helps them up. A: How does your background as a scholar and former Wesleyan student inform your role as an administrator? PR: I think I come to my position with the perspective of a faculty member. The only administrative position that I’ve held at a college or university is that of president. As a faculty member, I was intensely suspicious of any administrator, and so I think I understand a healthy skepticism about any administration. I have tried to be as transparent as possible about what we do, especially in economic matters. Occasionally, there are serious issues of privacy that make it impossible to be as transparent as one would like to be. But on the whole, I think that faculty should be suspicious of administrators. My scholarly work also influences me, which may be for better or worse. My work is about how people make sense of the past. How you deal with memory, desire, trauma, and emotion. Here I am, back in the place where I went to college, which for me was an extraordinarily transformative experience. The person I was when I got here was very different from the person who graduated, in large part because of the teachers I had and the students I met. So for me coming back here is not just an administrative responsibility, but it’s a deeply emotional and intellectual responsibility because, after all, I work on how people deal with their past. The book I am completing this summer deals with issues of history and memory in French cultural history, as well as in teaching these subjects in the contemporary American university. My scholarly work has always been infused and informed by what I’ve been teaching. I always think of my work in as integrated a way as possible, and I try to keep it that way, even while being a university president. A: The recession has strained the University’s finances and forced the University to re-evaluate many of its plans. What has the recession taught you about running a University? How has the recession affected your priorities as President? PR: The recession has taught me that we must be extremely prudent in our use of resources that should in an institution like ours last forever. I think I began to see that necessity for prudence even before the recession hit, when we postponed the science building, but the recession showed us that we really needed to concentrate on our priorities. We did balance the budget, we did cut a lot of things, but we didn’t cut financial aid. The faculty and staff had a pay freeze and those of us at the top had a pay cut, but we didn’t have to have generalized layoffs. In fact we hired over 20 professors in the middle of the recession because we decided we would not cut corners in the curriculum. These hires will have a big impact on students. We also during this period started the Small Class Initiative and added dozens of small classes being taught by our regular faculty. The economic conditions of the last year have really shown me how important it is to be more disciplined about how we use resources we’re lucky enough to have. We have to save money for emergencies; we have put together reserves for contingencies. I don’t think the student experience has been negatively impacted by the cuts we’ve made, and I really want to make sure that that remains the case.  I joke with the alumni sometimes that when I came back to Wesleyan, I discovered that I am a fiscal conservative. Of all places to make that discovery, Wesleyan? But it’s true; I don’t like to spend money I don’t have. Some people said we should have a freeze on hiring, I said no, that would have meant fewer classes. We can’t afford to have fewer classes. We did receive a $1 million grant to start the small class initiative and we did go out and hire Amy Bloom. She’s a great writer who was teaching at Yale, lives nearby and would love to teach at Wesleyan. Happily, I could find a donor to pay for it. All this is to say that I think there are some really great things you can do in the middle of an economic recession as long as you’re really careful about how you spend money. A: Certainly as students, we find the day-to-day college experience to be quite unpredictable. What have you found to be most surprising in your three years as President? PR: The murder last year was by far the most shocking. The shock of the event itself and then the responsibility of trying to keep the campus as safe as possible while there was still a murderer at large was of course beyond surprising. And the compassion, and cooperation, and solidarity at Wesleyan and people outside of Wesleyan… I can’t say enough how proud I was by their generosity of spirit. So there was the surprise of horror and the surprise at how wonderful people can be. And then there are the surprises of being woken up at 3 a.m. and being asked to protect our students from the Middletown Police Department down on Fountain Avenue. Coming out in the middle of the night, and finding the street filled with drunken students and a TV camera was very surprising. I’ve also been to some just wonderful performances and even performed myself, which I never thought I would do in public. I’ve really enjoyed playing music here, and students have been so kind. Other surprises: The economic conditions at the University were surprising to me, but now we’ve got things in hand. And I was just surprised by how much attention people pay to the president. I didn’t do that when I was a student. It’s really surprising to me that people pay attention if I go the gym or walk Mathilde. I should add that people here have been so friendly most of the time; sometimes parents come up to me and complain about a grade I gave in my class, but that’s very infrequent (HA HA). A: What are you most proud of in your term as President and what would you have done differently? PR: I’m most proud of the leadership team’s response last year to the murder. I think we did our best, and that was the most important thing at that moment. Looking ahead, I’m really proud of how we’ve been able to put the university on a track to build the endowment through fundraising, rather than spend money through fundraising. That is an enormous shift in a difficult economic climate. I love the curriculum initiatives, the College of the Environment and creative writing. I think the heart of the school, you know I’m a nerd at heart, is the curriculum and in the end you reflect your values by what you teach. So strengthening the academic programs is really important to me. What do I wish I had done differently? I opened my mouth about too many things my first year and got myself in unnecessarily hot water. I created distractions by saying something in student life was stupid and The Argus ran with it because I really did say it. I said some things as if I knew the place better than I did. I did go here, but it was a long time ago. I’ve come to realize that I only knew a small part of Wesleyan—my friends, classes—and that was my world, but not all of Wesleyan. So I wish I had been a little more circumspect. I talk a lot, but like Wesleyan students, I’m willing to make mistakes. I don’t have a secret formula, I don’t do everything perfectly, so I try to make sure that I am respectful of others and clear in my reasoning. That’s the best I can do. I’m called upon to make many judgments: from big budget items to individual judicial cases. I don’t pretend to have the magic solution. I look at every case, and really think about it, so as to be as consistent and fair as possible. A: What are your plans for the year ahead? PR: Next year, we will continue to work on the things we’ve started. This will include civic engagement work, the internationalization of the student body, and changes in the curriculum. We will look for opportunities for partnerships with other institutions to extend the reach of the University with partners that make sense for us, whether they’re in China or Chicago. And the other thing we’ll do is we’ll stir the pot again, that is we’ll say, ‘OK, we did the College of the Environment, what’s the next big thing?” I think the curriculum should be constantly offering opportunities for innovation. There are faculty members who would like to see more classes that reach across more of the curriculum. I would also like to see us really build on our strengths. It’s a great university overall, and we attract wonderful students, and there are some places where I think lately we have really shined.  The film department, for example, is a program that is internationally recognized for its excellence as a small, but mighty crew. We can build on that. Our science programs are also internationally recognized. We will also invest in the sciences. We really want to make sure that although they are not getting a new building in the near future, we are investing in the equipment and the facilities so that students and faculty continue to do very high level research. In film, they go off to Hollywood and make movies, and in the sciences we also have stars go off to medical school, research careers and biotechnology firms, and I want to make sure we’re giving them the tools they need to be successful. We’re not giving them a brand new building, but we can invest in the sciences. There are opportunities to give the faculty more tools to expand their horizons and to build on the curriculum in ways that go beyond campus. The Albritton Center opened this year, as did the Shapiro writing center. I’m delighted that that building is now being used so well. And next year the squash courts will be under construction as we build a new home for the Career Resource Center, and the Art History and COL Departments. We may not be able to save MoCon but we can make something beautiful out of the old Squash Court Building. That’s something to celebrate."
"10/10/10 in Middletown: Students Hit Streets to Fight Climate Change","2010-10-13","by Sydney Lewis, Contributing Writer","On Sunday, 12 student volunteers celebrated “10/10/10,” the climate work party that took place across the globe, by going door-to-door in Middletown neighborhoods to provide information about subsidized weatherization programs available to Connecticut residents. The event, held on Oct. 10, 2010 (hence the title 10/10/10), was hosted by 350.org, an international campaign dedicated to raising awareness and creating solutions for the climate crisis. According to 350.org, the 10/10/10 campaign became one of the biggest days of environmental action in history, with over 7,000 events occurring across 188 countries to address the issue of climate change. Groups around the world planted trees, installed solar panels and stoves, and repaired bicycles, among many other projects. In comparison, the last 350.org event on Oct. 24, 2010 only had 5,000 events. “It was a historic day,” said 10/10/10 participant Dan Fischer ’12. “It was called the most widespread day of civic engagement ever and it was important that Wesleyan students were involved. Events happened in every country in the world except for four.” Wesleyan’s 10/10/10 project was coordinated by Matthew Lichtash ’13 and Evan Weber ’13 through the Wesleyan chapter of Connecticut Students for a Just and Stable Future partnered with The Jonah Center for Earth and Art, a local non-profit organization that works to preserve ecologically significant areas in Middletown. On Sunday, Wesleyan students knocked on an estimated 350 doors of Middletown residents to encourage them to participate in home energy efficiency improvement programs offered by The Jonah Center. “We thought it would be a great program to try to promote in Middletown and would be a good way to spend 10/10/10,” Weber said. The two programs, Home Energy Solutions (HES) and Weatherization Residential Assistance Partnership (WRAP), bring in private contractors to help improve efficiency in Middletown homes. The contractors are hired by the state of Connecticut, which collaborates with The Connecticut Energy Efficiency Fund, The North End Action Team, Connecticut Light and Power, The New England Conservation Services, and The Jonah Center. Technicians will check insulation, wrap pipes, check and seal leaks in doors, windows, and ducts, inspect efficiency of appliances, and install energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs. These services will save homeowners about $250 annually and improve air quality in Middletown. Although the services can usually cost between $500 and $1600, homeowners are only required to pay a $75 fee to participate in HES. If residents’ income is below a specified amount, they may qualify to participate in WRAP, which is a free program. “I was overjoyed with the few people who showed up [to campaign],” Weber said. “It is very difficult to motivate people to do things outside of themselves. Those who participated commented how nice it was to actually get up and out into the community to help people live better lives and take concrete action towards preserving the state of the planet for future generations.” Of the hundreds of homes the volunteers stopped by, they only gave out forms to about 50—mostly because many people didn’t answer the door. According to Fischer, most people they spoke to were open to the idea. “People were very friendly and definitely receptive,” Fischer said. “We were frankly offering them a pretty good deal. They were happy to know that we were volunteers and out for a good cause and that they would save on their electricity bill as a result.” Some residents, however, were less receptive than others. “One woman actually said that she didn’t want to change the status quo, which is weird,” Lichtash said. “But the majority of people were nice and took the forms.” Another woman who opened the door called the Middletown Police after threatening two volunteers, alleging that they needed a permit to solicit and knock on doors. When a police officer rolled through the neighborhood 10 minutes later, the students only had to show their identification before they were allowed to continue down the block. Not deterred by these few surprising encounters, the students hope to continue the campaign by working to weatherize University professors’ houses. The University has pledged to pay the $75 fee for each professor, so the group is working on getting more professors involved in the program. The group also has plans to expand beyond Middletown. “We’re going to continue outreach on weatherization in addition to working on shutting down the Bridgeport Coal Plant,” Fischer said."
"“9500 Liberty”","2011-03-01","by Sarah P. Cassel, Class of 2013,","This past weekend I went to the screening of the movie “9500 Liberty,” a documentary about immigration in Prince William County, Va. The movie illustrates how elected officials within the county were pressured by residents to adopt an “Immigrant Resolution,” which allowed police officers to question any individual they had “probable cause” to believe was an illegal immigrant. The resolution ultimately was overturned, but not before Prince William County received national attention for its role in the dramatic immigration debate.  The directors of the documentary, Annabel Park and Eric Byler, were present at the screening, staying late to address questions about the film and political activism in general. During the question-answer session, Annabel spoke about the need to “break down fences” that separate people from engaging in meaningful, knowledge-seeking dialogue. She spoke of the importance of developing political opinions based on substantive facts as opposed to on stories concocted with an agenda in mind. The theory was to reframe discussions so that they are no longer arguments between “us” and “them,” but rather dialectics that are aimed at approaching greater truth. As I listened to Annabel, I thought of Jürgen Habermas’ discursive theory, which promotes civic engagement within society to develop public policy. Habermas’ vision is of active political participation by citizens to generate informed ideas regarding the desired direction of the state. In this view, every individual has equal worth, and thus equal say, in the formation of new societal procedures so that their realization will benefit everyone. The downfall of this theory is twofold: first, that it relies upon eventual consensus, and second, it does not carry enough intrinsic political power to force agreed-upon policies to be implemented. Dialogue is useful for challenging people’s basic assumptions and promoting an atmosphere of learning, but in order for it to have any practical consequences, it must involve legislative power. Therefore, the discursive theory must articulate its objective as attempting to enlist individuals in the rumination of ideas so as to create an informed citizenry that is able to engage in democracy from a politically knowledgeable standpoint.  In order for these civil discussions to be effectively actualized, every individual must come to them with a “Will to Truth”—a sincere desire to gain knowledge and create shared experiences with others that will ultimately inform one’s personal social and political opinions. In Plato’s Apology, in which Socrates defends himself in the Athenian court on charges associated with practicing philosophy, Socrates serves as the apotheosis of a character with the Will to Truth. His entire persona is one of constant questioning with an insatiable desire to learn and understand, though at the same time he is wise in that he recognizes what he does not know and does not claim to know it. The principle illustrated is that we should never be so confident as to believe that, in our pursuit of truth, we actually have it, for our quest merely brings us closer through the constant addition of levels of nuance to the situation. Developing the Will to Truth requires deliberation, commitment, and introspection, and we must be willing to admit that we do not know.  Annabel and Eric’s mission in creating the film “9500 Liberty” was to cast a shadow of doubt on the assumptions held by many residents of Prince William County who equated the presence of illegal immigrants in their community with harmful consequences, such as higher crime rates. While this popular theory had no empirical basis, it was constructed by long-time residents of the county as a façade to hide a deep insecurity caused by the quickly changing culture of the neighborhood. It is important to note that those people did not have malicious intentions—they merely felt that their way of live was being threatened and it demanded protection from the change.  Everyone wants to be heard and to be taken seriously. We all would like for our opinions to matter and for actions to be undertaken in accordance with our values. It is for this reason that a discursive-theory style dialogue, guided by the Will to Truth, is necessary to promote meaningful civic political involvement. Everyone engaging in dialogue must not only participate with a personal desire to gain greater understanding, but also with the recognition that others are doing the same. We need not accept every viewpoint as moral, or even as valid, but it is imperative to see the bit of truth that motivates each opinion so that we may explore the pieces that collectively form a slightly more complete picture of the truth."
"Support the CPE Re-Approval","2011-03-01","by Katherine Eyster,","After a successful and inspiring four semesters, the Center for Prison Education pilot program at Cheshire Correctional is up for re-approval. After faculty assessment, the proposed five year expansion plan was approved by the Educational Policy Committee last week; it now faces an all-faculty vote on March 1. Those involved in the program have every reason to be confident and proud. To ensure its passage, I am asking you, the student body, to lend your voice to this critical cause. As outlined in its mission statement, the goal of the CPE is: “To advance Wesleyan’s commitment to civic engagement by offering college courses to incarcerated individuals, in order both to enrich the lives of those who are systematically denied access to educational opportunities and to enhance Wesleyan’s academic community.” For the past two years, the most meaningful work that I have done has been within prison walls. As a workshop leader and tutor, I have found community, inspiration, and insight among a peer group that I otherwise would have never known. I entered Wesleyan eager to push my boundaries and challenge my assumptions, but looking back over my four years at this University, I never could have imagined the remarkable outcome of this pursuit. The Wesleyan students at Cheshire prove daily their commitment to the program and to their education. They are committed to protecting and promoting the group before their own interests. When decisions are being made, they never hesitate to consider how these decisions might affect other Wesleyan students and future inmates who might seek to enroll in Wesleyan’s Center for Prison Education. They are curious, they are respectful, and they are committed. Their enthusiasm is inspiring. They have found an immensely positive focus on talent, compassion and teamwork that might otherwise be wasted or lost altogether.  I share this to affirm that what is being accomplished encompasses, yet goes far beyond service learning and civic engagement. This program, quite simply, is changing lives. The five-year proposal includes enrolling new cohorts at Cheshire and expanding to York Correctional, the women’s facility, in 2012.  The inmates, once admitted, enroll in two courses a semester, taught by Wesleyan faculty who receive a stipend for their work. All of the money to run the program is raised privately and does not come from the University. Students are involved in the program as writing tutors and teaching assistants. Students also volunteer at three correctional facilities as workshop leaders, college prep tutors, and classroom assistants. You can find out more at: www.wesleyan.edu/cpe. It is an exceptional program, one that students founded, and one that students, alumni, professors, and the students at Cheshire are committed to seeing through. If you care, let your professors know: send them an email, stop by their office hours, write them a letter, or catch them after class. This is one of few student initiatives to become part of the structure, and indeed mission, of the University. Help us make sure that the momentous student support is not overlooked or undersold. Encourage your professors to vote in support of the program at the faculty meeting on March 1.    Eyster is a member of the class of 2010 and a Ford Fellow."
"Civic Engagement Certificate Encourages Community Involvement","2011-11-03","by Isabel Rouse, Assistant Features Editor","Spanning a diverse range of majors and disciplines, including chemistry, biology, religion, sociology, government, film, and theater, the new Civic Engagement Certificate (CEC) already boasts 23 fall courses and 19 spring courses cross-listed in the Civic Engagement program. “We’re trying to integrate practical experience of civic activity in volunteer work and internships with academic work, giving students a critical and reflective distance on their practical activities,” said Professor Donald Moon, Ezra and Cecile Zilkha Professor in the College of Social Studies. “Most Wesleyan students participate in some form of civic engagement. The Certificate is designed for students who want to understand the role of engagement in a democracy.” According to the University website, the CEC is much like the more established certificates, in that it enables students to attain a greater degree of curricular coherence than would otherwise be possible. “It provides information about how they could pursue that interest by indicating what courses they should take, and the extracurricular activities such as volunteering that they should consider,” Moon said. The University has long attempted to create an atmosphere that encourages a strong social consciousness and participation in a variety of formal and informal civic activities. According to the University’s website, civic engagement involves activities that allow individuals to strengthen their communities. “These activities include volunteer work, practica, and service-learning courses,” the website states. “This certificate is designed for students interested in reflecting upon and integrating their civic and academic efforts.” Moon believes that the Certificate will help influence the larger University community, even if only a handful of students take explicit advantage of the new opportunity. “We hope to enable students who are committed to civic engagement to pursue a course of study and related activities that would enhance their capacity to engage in civic life in an effective and thoughtful way,” Moon said. “One of Wesleyan’s great strengths is its engagement with the world, and this program is yet another way in which we can fulfill this aspect of our institutional mission.” The Certificate is also closely linked with the Service-Learning course cluster, which integrates experiences outside the classroom with an academic curriculum taught in a classroom setting. “Civic engagement involves bringing attention to the voices of individuals who might otherwise not be heard by the larger society,” said Professor of Theater Ronald Jenkins, who teaches two prison outreach theater classes within the Service-Learning course cluster. The Certificate entails several requirements: a sophomore year foundation course, at least five courses related to civic engagement, a minimum of 40 hours of service work, a practicum, and a senior seminar. One of the best examples of courses offered within the certificate is the prison outreach course THEA205, Prison Outreach Through Theater. The course, which is taught by Professor of Theater Ron Jenkins, brings together students and incarcerated adults to explore and perform texts written by incarcerated individuals. “I became involved in the program through the Service-Learning Program, where I taught courses demonstrating how theater can be experienced as a catalyst for social change,” Jenkins said. “My experience with the transformative power of theater came when I was incarcerated in South Africa while researching performances staged as protests against apartheid. In an absurdly overcrowded cell, I was astonished to see how they defied the injustice of their imprisonment by transforming it into a celebration of resistance to apartheid, performing protest songs, dances and satirical humor.” Civic engagement has long been a focus of the University, so the program is not altogether revolutionary or without foundation. President Roth made social dedication a key strategy in “Wesleyan 2020: A Framework for Planning” through the creation of the Civic Engagement Committee. This committee suggests methods of expanding engagement opportunities, and one of the outgrowths of this committee is the newly founded Certificate. Professor Jenkins sees the implications of this course as reaching far beyond anything exclusive to the University. “Giving voice to this voiceless population is one of the ways that civic engagement can contribute to social change,” Jenkins said. “When Wesleyan students perform the writings of incarcerated individuals with incarcerated individuals, they are expanding the boundaries of civic engagement beyond the confines of the course and contributing to the transformation of attitudes, which is a necessary step towards the transformation of society.”"
"Campaign Finance Reform a Necessity","2011-11-07","by Olivia Horton, Campus Coordinator of Wesleyan Democracy Matters, Argus News Editor, Class of 2014","As this week’s Middletown municipal elections spark debate about voter rights, and Occupy Wall Street protesters across the nation call for limits on corporate power, the need for electoral reform becomes increasingly apparent. Dissatisfied citizens are uniting around a desire for increased political accountability, the removal of big money from politics, and a return to popular sovereignty. The Occupy movement has effectively raised awareness and encouraged support for these demands, but the time has come to focus our efforts and utilize existing organizations and mechanisms to enact change. As President of the Wesleyan Chapter of Democracy Matters, I propose that we channel the energy of the Occupy movement into the pursuit of campaign finance reform. This is a tangible goal that would help solve many of the problems of corruption and inappropriate corporate influence within our political system. Clean and fair elections offer an alternative to the current methods of campaign finance and returns to a government that is by the people and for the people. A system of publicly funded elections would encourage politicians to appeal to average citizens whose political voice might otherwise be drowned out by donations from a rich minority. Rather than allowing officials to seek large campaign donations from extremely wealthy individuals or from large corporations, the reformed system would require politicians to seek broader constituent support. Politicians who demonstrate a certain level of support and agree to operate within such a system would limit donations received from special interests in exchange for additional government funding for their campaign. This allows politicians to truly represent their constituency as a whole, instead of the select few who can afford to fund their election. Once in office, representatives will not be obligated to cater to special interests or corporations that have the ability to offer significant campaign donations. Electoral reform would loosen the grip that corporations currently have on public officials due to the regrettable importance of money in campaigns. Politicians could truly hold corporations accountable for their actions without the fear of losing their means of re-election. The demands of the average citizen would hold actual political weight, and it would be in the interest of representatives to pay attention to these demands, regardless of the size of the citizen’s wallet. The removal of big money from politics increases the influence of citizens and represents a return to popular sovereignty. Our current system is tainted by the corrupt influence of corporations who are immune from political consequences because public officials are dependent on their campaign donations. If citizens want to exercise a true voice in elections and policy making, they first need to destroy this roadblock to democracy. The recent efforts to fight for the right of Wesleyan students to vote in Middletown represents a commitment to political accountability and a desire to have an impact on local governance. These aspirations would be aided by campaign finance reform, which allows true equality in the voting process regardless of individual wealth. If the wealthy few continue to be allowed a disproportionate amount of influence within the government, then voter registration drives and other forms of civic engagement may ultimately be irrelevant in our political reality. Important steps have been taken in the past few months to further political engagement and raise awareness about wealth inequality and corporate influence. However, in order for real shifts in power to occur, changes must be made within the political system with regards to how we elect our officials. Representatives must truly be made accountable to the people through the public financing of elections. The passion for change clearly exists among the American people and it is time to progress from a vocalization of this passion to tangible objectives. The goal of a government truly beholden to citizens is well within reach, especially if we utilize the resources of organizations like Democracy Matters to educate others and advocate for reform."
"Green Party Presidential Candidate Jill Stein Comes to Middletown","2012-03-05","by Lily Baggott, Contributing Writer","Last Thursday, Presidential candidate Jill Stein came to Middletown. The Wesleyan College Greens, a student group dedicated to Green Party politics, arranged for her to give a talk at the First Church of Christ on Court Street. Ross Levin ’15 founded the campus chapter of College Greens this past fall. Since then, the group has brought several speakers to campus, including the Green Party candidate for Sheriff of Philadelphia Cheri Honkala, the Green Party 2004 presidential candidate David Cobb, and most recently Stein. According to Levin, Stein is most likely to become the Green Party’s official presidential candidate, but the Party still faces challenges to getting her name on the ballot. “It’s also the start of a state-wide ballot access drive,” Levin noted. “The Jill Stein event will be the formal launch of the petition drive.” According to Levin, Democrats and Republicans are usually guaranteed placement on the ballot in most states, but third parties are required to obtain signatures to get on the ballot. Because of this, the Green Party must go from state to state gathering support and signatures to get on the ballot. Levin noted that Pennsylvania requires a large number of signatures to get candidates on the ballot and that the number of signatures required varies by state. “[Pennsylvania is] one extreme,” he said. “Connecticut falls kind of in the middle but more toward Pennsylvania than towards the freer states.” This year, the party needs to collect a minimum of 7,500 signatures in Connecticut. According to Levin, they have set a goal of 12,000 signatures. College Greens members plan to go around campus and Middletown, collecting signatures for their ballot access drive. “We’re going to be doing this ballot access drive, [so] I am sure you’ll see us around campus collecting signatures to get Jill Stein on the ballot,” Levin said. “There’s also this state Senate candidate that we’ll be helping. So I think what we’re also going to try to do is use those two campaigns, for a lack of a better word, to build the College Greens as an interminable presence.” He also noted that the goal of College Greens is different from the goals of other political student groups on campus. “If you’re going to compare us to Wesleyan Democrats, our focus is different,” Levin said. “It’s more like raising awareness that the Green Party is a viable option, rather than this kind of ‘helping out the machine’ that the Wesleyan Democrats do.” Although the group will be working with specific political candidates, College Greens member Dan Goldman ’12 and Levin both stressed that the goal of the group is to spread awareness and education about alternative political parties. “Knowing that there is an alternative is a really powerful thing,” Goldman said. Jill Stein ran for governor in Massachusetts in 2002 and 2010 and other state government positions in the past several years. Her talk on Thursday focused on her “Green New Deal,” which addresses global warming and financial crises. Her talk also addressed the Green Party’s views on legalizing marijuana, ending the war, eliminating student debt, and helping the economy. “I think these are issues which a lot of people on this campus would agree with,” College Greens member Jeremy Keim-Shenk ’12 noted. After the talk, she held a question-and-answer session where many students and Middletown residents inquired further about her policies and asked about the controversial third party “spoiling” of the vote. Afterwards, she went around the Usdan University Center and spoke to students. “I would just say that this is your ballpark,” Stein said when asked what her message to students is. “This is your challenge, and this is your opportunity to create the kind of world that you really need. It’s falling apart right now on your shoulders, and this campaign is a chance to create an alternative that really is about you. It’s of, by, and for you and the future.” With about 65 people in attendance, Levin and Keim-Shenk were slightly disappointed with the student turnout. “Overall, I would say I think it was fairly successful,” Keim-Shenk said. “We were maybe hoping for a few more students, but given that it wasn’t on campus and given that it was snowing, it was all right.” Levin also noted that he hopes that this event and the College Greens’ general presence on campus will involve younger people in the Green Party. “One of the reasons I have felt so good about investing so much energy in this event is that it’s a way to promote activism on campus,” Levin said. “My hope is that people will be brought into the fold of civic engagement.” The event was held at the First Church of Christ in Middletown, in part to broaden its scope, according to Levin. “We also wanted to make this more of a Middletown-wide event and Connecticut-wide event, rather than just Wesleyan,” Levin stated. Levin and the College Greens have been working closely with Middletown resident Vittorio (Vic) Lancia, a local Green Party supporter. Lancia has been involved in Green Party efforts in Middletown for about ten years, according to Levin. “I’m hoping this [event] is something to get things cooking in Middletown and to kick off Jill Stein’s campaign and also the energy of the students,” Lancia said. “I’ve been able to connect with the students because there’s nothing going on [in Middletown], so I have got to go where the action is [on campus]. And I really like their idea of bridging the gap between Wesleyan and Middletown.” College Greens plan to continue bringing speakers to campus and Middletown. According to Levin, they hope to eventually bring the Green Party’s 2000 Presidential Candidate Ralph Nader. They will also continue to work on the ballot access drive, and, according to Goldman, possibly sponsor a screening of “An Unreasonable Man,” a documentary about Ralph Nader."
"Civic Engagement Fellowship Will Launch In July","2012-04-09","by Lily Baggott, Staff Writer","The Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) has launched a new Civic Engagement Fellowship that will begin in July 2012. The fellowship will be a one-year, paid position for a recent graduate. “Civic engagement and engagement with the world is a priority for the University,” Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Catherine Lechowicz said. “We are very excited to have a recent alum fill this role to help connect all of these different things that are happening on campus.” In an effort to connect all of the civic engagement efforts on campus, the new fellowship will have a broad range of responsibilities, according to Lechowicz. Based at the CCP, the fellow will work with the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism (OCS), Green Street Arts Center, Center for Prison Education (CPE), Service-Learning Center, Allbritton Center for Study of Public Life, and the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. “We want these things to be connected and have synergy,” Lechowicz said. “And so this individual will help both in terms of engaging the students that are going through our office and also building bridges to these other areas. [The fellow will] help students see that, while we have different centers, all of this work is definitely connected.” The fellow will connect local civic action by the CCP and academic study, according to Lechowicz. Additionally, the fellow will work with students, manage social media, and generate online resources, among other duties. “What we imagine is that the CCP is really hands on local work, but really the social entrepreneurship piece is providing training and development of ideas in terms of social ventures,” Lechowicz said. “And then the Allbritton Center is more on the academic side in terms of studying public life and looking at it through an academic lens.” Lechowicz noted that she and other staff members were inspired to create the fellowship after seeing the CPE and writing fellowships in action. “It’s similar to the writing fellowships,” Lechowicz said. “I think the great work that has happened with that program through the engagement of recent alums is a really exciting opportunity.” Lechowicz said she envisioned the position for a recent graduate with the University experience sztill fresh on his or her mind. “We’ve all been talking for a while about the amount of work we’re doing through the CCP with limited staffing and seeing that our students are so engaged when they’re here as undergrads,” Lechowicz said. “And we really see this additional year as an opportunity to capture that energy and excitement while also helping the student gain this professional experience in a context that they know really well.” In addition, the fellow will work closely with the new Civic Engagement Certificate Program. “We just started the Civic Engagement Certificate Program,” Lechowicz said. “This person will help in the launching of that program. So there’s lots of different little things that are happening that I think will be really great to have someone helping us focus on that.” With the advent of the Patricelli Center and the growth of the CCP, Lechowicz and other center directors discussed creating this fellowship during the last few months. “These were ongoing conversations between directors here at the Center for Community Partnerships as these other programs were developed,” Lechowicz said. “This is what we see as a need and as an opportunity for students to have a lot of input, as a recent grad, to develop these programs more.” The hiring committee will consist of Lechowicz, Director of Community Relations Frank Kuan, Director of Service Learning Center Suzanne O’Connell, and Internship and Civic Engagement Coordinator Paul Gagnon. The committee accepted applications through April 10, and Lechowicz expressed excitement over the quality of the applicants. The decision will be made by the end of this month in order to have the fellow in office by July. The fellowship will run for one year, from July to June, and will be a full-time, paid fellowship. According to Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Rob Rosenthal, the Executive Budget Committee—composed of himself, President Michael Roth, and Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts-—accepted the fellowship proposal and allocated an estimated $28,000 for the position’s salary. Rosenthal said that the proposal will be reviewed again after two years. “It’s a new money proposal, meaning it’s funded from the general budget but is a pilot program only, which will be reviewed after two years,” Rosenthal wrote in an email to The Argus. Lechowicz said that hiring one fellow would be sufficient to meet the growing demands of the centers. “I think we’ll see how this goes,” she said. “Certainly, through the Office of Community Service, we have grown our programs, but I think it can be managed pretty easily with an additional person.”"
"Patricelli Center Puts Social Change in Career Path","2012-10-22","by Rebecca Seidel, Assistant Features Editor","On a campus bustling with activists, it’s easy to tap into the spirit of philanthropy and enthusiasm for social change. For those looking to channel this passion into a nonprofit business venture, or those trying to join the ranks of student leaders who are already doing so, the first place to go is the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. The Patricelli Center is housed in the basement of the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life. Founded last spring through a gift from the Robert [Patricelli ’61] and Margaret Patricelli Family Foundation, the Center provides resources and networking opportunities to students and alumni interested in starting nonprofit enterprises. Now in its second semester, the Patricelli Center is already a campus presence, offering workshops, grants, counseling, and internship opportunities to aspiring social entrepreneurs. The Center also offers extensive networking opportunities, drawing from connections to alumni involved in civic engagement. Its Board of Advisors includes alumni involved in prominent social enterprises, in addition to several members of Wesleyan’s faculty. According to the Center’s Civic Engagement Coordinator and Career Counselor Paul Gagnon, part of the value of having a center devoted to the pursuit of social entrepreneurship is that it offers students a chance to develop business skills not typically taught in classes. “We’re providing opportunities for students to develop skills of what I call a practical benefit, in areas that they might not necessarily get exposure to in their traditional Wesleyan classroom setting,” Gagnon said. To facilitate this type of training, the Patricelli Center holds workshops and seminars at regular intervals that are open to all students. The workshop scheduled for this Thursday, Oct. 25, called “Entrepreneurship Self-Assessment,” will help attendees gauge whether they have what it takes to start up their own business. The Center has also worked closely with a number of nonprofit groups on campus, including Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO), the MINDS Foundation, and Brighter Dawns. “Many of [these groups] actually predate the establishment of the Center, but the Center has helped [to] provide resources to those groups over the course of our first semester here and going forward,” Gagnon said. President and CEO of SHOFCO Kennedy Odede ’12 said he was grateful for the Patricelli Center and the work it does to help organizations such as his. “We will reach over 35,000 people in the Kibera slum this year through healthcare, clean water, community empowerment, and economic development programs,” Odede wrote in an email to The Argus. “This simply wouldn’t have been possible if the Patricelli family did not believe in the bold vision that change is possible even in places like Kibera, where the problems sometime seem insurmountable.” Raghu Appasani ’12, founder and CEO of the MINDS Foundation, noted that the Patricelli Center has offered him helpful business planning advice and connections with alumni since its establishment. “The Patricelli Center has been really helpful with networking,” he said. Connections with alumni are vital to the Patricelli Center’s endeavors. Since its founding, the Center has hosted several alumni guest speakers. The first speaker was Sasha Chanoff ’94, executive director of RefugePoint, a nonprofit offering assistance to refugees in Africa. Lara Galinsky ’96 ran a workshop hosted by the Patricelli Center last year centered on finding studnets’ passion. “It was a workshop-oriented process where students tried to do a self-assessment and identify with what Lara calls ‘heart, head, hustle,’” Gagnon recalled. “The three of those combined to help a student identify what it is that they think they might want to do with their career and their life. Outside of the Career Center, I’m not sure that there’s any other place on campus where a student would’ve been able to have that kind of exposure to that kind of program.” The Center also offers summer internships to Wesleyan students. Applicants put together proposals to work for specific social enterprise organizations or to start their own projects, and their applications are then reviewed by the Center. Additionally, the Patricelli Center offers grants for various student endeavors. It has a seed grant fund for student leaders seeking capital to start new social enterprises, and it also offers grants on a competitive basis for students to participate in off-campus social entrepreneurship training programs. Gagnon said that he hopes students will talk to him if they have ideas for organizations or projects they want to start. He outlined the steps he would take in guiding a student through hir ideas. “We’d be able to discuss it, and we’d be able to talk through some of the pertinent points that you’re trying to achieve,” he said. “I’d ask you to convince me why you want to pursue this. Convince me of your passion, and convince me of the underlying application to the nature of the problem you’re trying to address in the first place. Then I’d encourage you to make use of the workshops.” Gagnon added that the Center would work to connect a student with alumni, potentially find a mentor to help determine a direction for the project, and offer assistance with business mechanics like marketing and accounting. Above all, Gagnon said he wants the Patricelli Center to be a “home away from home” for aspiring social entrepreneurs. “Last spring, I’d say that this room acted as a clubhouse for a number of students because they were working on their company projects here, and that’s precisely the kind of environment that we want to foster and facilitate here,” he said. Co-president of Wesleyan’s chapter of the MINDS Foundation Ian Johnson ’13 expressed his appreciation for the Center’s resources. “We use the office space in there for all of our small meetings,” Johnson said. “Having the Patricelli Center also provides support and confidence for student entrepreneurship and collaboration.” Appasani agreed. “The office space in the Patricelli Center has been crucial for working late nights,” he said. Gagnon said that the number of non-profit campus groups is a testament to student dedication to social change. “It’s remarkable, the capability these students possess and their determination to get something done,” Gagnon said. “They’re so committed to making things happen—making a difference.” In a WesSeminar presentation on Oct. 18th, Gagnon cited data indicating that students these days are more interested than ever in careers involving civic engagement. A report done by Net Impact showed that 58 percent of students nationwide are willing to take a pay cut to work for an organization with values similar to their own. The same report found that a majority of students are confident that their work will eventually make a positive difference in the world. “When this generation cannot find a socially conscious job uniquely right for them, they create one,” Gagnon said. Additionally, Gagnon noted that in 2004 only about 20 colleges in the United States had a course or program focused on social entrepreneurship. Now, that figure is estimated to exceed 200. In some schools, social entrepreneurship comprises an entire department. Though there are many factors contributing to this attitude among young people, Gagnon said that it largely has to do with more students trying to link their passions to their career paths. “I think more and more young people are recognizing that there’s this need to do something that is larger than oneself,” he said. “I think that the students are seeing more than just being an individual or a cog in the wheel, and they’re trying to find something that more inspires their passions.” Gagnon said that beyond this generation’s inclinations toward social enterprise, Wesleyan in particular tends to generate lots of social entrepreneurs. “It seems like it’s just natural for Wesleyan to support this kind of activity and this kind of endeavor from a student’s perspective,” he said."
"Student Political Groups Battle Voting Apathy","2012-11-01","by Alexandra Ozols, Staff Writer","As the Nov. 6 Election Day approaches, campus political groups have been working to ignite a democratic spark in the student body. Given the University’s reputation as an activist campus, some of the students who are working the hardest for student political engagement expressed their disappointment with the level of student interest during an election cycle that includes a close presidential contest as well as close senatorial races. “There’s a sense that reading the news and watching the debates constitute political engagement,” Wesleyan Democrats (WesDems) president Michael Linden ’15 said. “But there’s more to do.” Linden said that he perceives a sense of apathy on the part of college students in general and in University students in particular. “Disillusionment of college students [with the political process] stems from a general sense that their vote doesn’t matter,” he said. “Even though their vote is probably not going to be the deciding vote, exercising it is still a meaningful act of civic engagement.” In response to the perceived apathy, the WesDems have spent most of the last six weeks conducting a series of “dorm storms,” mostly in freshman housing. Linden said those efforts netted between 100 and 200 new student voter registrations in Middletown. Linden said his organization focused its voter registration drive on Connecticut residents and out-of-state students who had never registered in their home states. “Student-to-student outreach is very effective,” he said. Linden noted that such outreach could be critical in Connecticut, where there is a competitive Senate race between Democratic Representative of the 5th Congressional District Chris Murphy and the Republican candidate former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, who ran against Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 election. “I understand being disillusioned with Obama, but what the gridlock in Washington has taught us is that down ballot races have a real impact,” Linden said. “While I think a lot of students say, ‘The two-party system isn’t for me,’ it’s a reality, and there’s a very clear dichotomy between the two parties.” Wesleyan for Warren campus organizer Sam Ebb ’13 agrees. His group has rallied students in support of Democrat Elizabeth Warren, who is challenging Republican incumbent Scott Brown in the Massachusetts senatorial contest. Ebb said he believes Warren’s positions resonate with the progressive University student body. He cited the Harvard professor’s economic policies and her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for the Obama administration. “Also, Brown’s co-sponsorship of the Blunt Amendment and vote against equal pay for equal work should be big sticking points for members of the Wesleyan community,” Ebb said. During this semester, the 15-20 students actively involved in the Wesleyan for Warren organization—including its six interns, some of whom had worked for the campaign during the summer—conducted an absentee ballot drive and ran weekly phone banks to connect with undecided and independent voters in Massachusetts. Several of the core members also spent a few weekends canvassing in Worcester, Mass., for their candidate. According to Ebb, the organization also supported WesDems’ efforts on behalf of Connecticut candidate Murphy. “Most people at Wesleyan are going to support Obama and Murphy,” Linden said. “It’s just a matter of whether they’re going to get out and vote.” Democracy Matters, a non-partisan national student organization, emphasizes college student participation in elections. President of the University’s chapter of Democracy Matters Alyssa Bonneau ’14 expressed support for the need to encourage even politically astute students to exercise the franchise. “You come to Wesleyan and have expectations for an activist campus, but we’re not as politically active as people think we are,” Bonneau said. “Compared to other places, people do intend to vote.” Bonneau said that, while her group is very small, it has been working with the WesDems to urge students to make a plan to vote. “The most important thing is to create an atmosphere of excitement and to try to remind people that this is an historic event,” she said. As part of its get-out-the-vote effort, Democracy Matters has arranged for free coffee for any student who brings in a mug to the Red and Black Café and presents hir voting sticker. The recently founded Students for a Free Society has chosen not to endorse any political candidate, nor has it engaged in any election campaigning. “Students for a Free Society has attracted people who, for the most part, reject the liberal-conservative dichotomy,” said the group’s founder and president Charlie Smith ’15. According to Smith, the new group is composed of libertarians, anarchists, conservatives, communists, and left-wingers. “Many people feel disillusioned with the two main parties and generally tend to be skeptical of government,” Smith said. “Some people in the group may not vote because they don’t want to have to pick the lesser of two evils. We would rather try to educate people and change their views than ask them to make a vote that isn’t necessarily an educated one.” Monica Sheridan ’15, a former member of Wesleyan Republicans, said she is not interested in resurrecting the group, which is now listed as inactive on the Wesleyan Student Assembly webpage. She described most campus Republicans as fiscal conservatives with generally libertarian views on social issues who can be integrated into the new Students for a Free Society. In contrast to 2011, when University students voted at five different polling sites, this year students registered at their campus address will vote at one of two polling stations. Because of redistricting, the vast majority will vote at the senior center located across from Broad Street Books, and those living north of Washington Street will vote at the Macdonough Elementary School. Shuttles will ferry students from Usdan to the two polling sites every 10 minutes on Election Day, Nov. 6."
"CCP Launches Campaign to Highlight Town-Gown Collaborations","2013-02-04","by Michelle Li, Contributing Writer","Even within the University bubble, students are often unaware of the institutional practices around them; buildings get constructed, lightbulbs get changed, toilets get plunged, and nobody really knows how. Beginning Tuesday, Feb. 5, the Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) will launch a new campaign  titled, “Did You Know?” which is aimed at raising awareness of the partnerships connecting the University and Middletown. Some students feel that they could benefit from learning more about the University’s relations with Middletown. “I think Wesleyan students would participate in more civic engagement if they knew more about what’s going on,” Jessica Seidman ’16 said. “Wesleyan feels kind of like a separate community from Middletown.” Heading the campaign are Civic Engagement Fellow for the Center for Community Partnerships Dana Pellegrino ’12 and Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Cathy Lechowicz. Pellegrino explained that the campaign will feature twice-weekly sound bites giving facts on relations between Middletown and the University. The Service-Learning Center, the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism, and the Office of Community Relations are three branches of the CCP, the umbrella group of offices that works on University-community initiatives. In addition, several student groups, such as Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO), Wesleyan Alliance for Generational Exchange (WesAGE), Woodrow Wilson Tutoring, and Housing and Hunger, as well as service-learning classes, are also part of the Center. The resources of the CCP are available to students interested in civic engagement. According to Pellegrino, the pieces of information that “Did You Know?” publishes will come from University offices and student groups. The project will rely strongly on student feedback. The Office of Community Service (OCS), in addition to offering students the opportunity to secure work-study positions, allows some student groups the chance to help out in projects such as the “Did You Know?” campaign. Lechowicz said that students will have the opportunity to contribute to posts of the “Did You Know?” Campaign. The sound bites will be posted Tuesdays and Thursdays on various social media outlets, among which are Twitter @wes_engage, the OCS Facebook page, the webpage of the CCP, and the Middletown Eye, a blog managed by Middletown residents. Despite the many media outlets the campaign will be utilizing, not all students are optimistic that the project will meet its intended goals. Although Seidman indicated interest in learning more about partnerships between Middletown and the University, Maria Massad ’16 expressed some doubts about the campaign. “I think increasing Middletown-University relations is a noble cause, but I think people should be integrated into the community through events and not blogs,” Massad said. Both Pellegrino and Lechowicz emphasized that the campaign’s main focus is on raising awareness of town-gown partnerships. “This is not sugarcoat[ing] about engagement,” Lechowicz said. Pellegrino additionally notes that that the campaign is not intended to make students feel that the University is improving Middletown; rather, the sound bites will showcase occasions of equal partnership between the University and the town. “It’s about sharing the little things that go on that people may not know about,” Lechowicz said."
"Chalk is Talk: Is Wesleyan’s Chalking Ban Illegal?","2013-03-29","by Eric Stephen, Assistant Editor-in-Chief, Emeritus","Shannon Welch/Photo Editor Wesleyan University is now just under halfway into the 11th year of a blanket moratorium on chalking on campus property. The moratorium (or perhaps we should just call it a ban since there is nothing to suggest that this is a temporary limitation), announced on Oct. 3, 2002 in a campus-wide email by then-President Douglas Bennet, was justified on the grounds that “halking, as practiced, undermines our sense of community and impedes substantive dialogue.” While both Presidents Bennet (1995-2007) and Michael Roth (2007-) have provided justifications for the ban on chalking, both arguments appear to be predicated on the notion that, because Wesleyan is a private institution, the University has no responsibility to state or federal protections of freedom of speech. As a result, student response to the ban over the course of the last decade has focused on the ethical issues surrounding a suppression of speech and not the legality of the moratorium itself. However, state law suggests that this story is not so simple. It is time, therefore, for the dog to bark—for students to look critically at the prohibition to see whether the University is enforcing an illegal policy and, more broadly, what rights we as students have to speak within our privately owned ivory tower. In this article, it will be argued that Wesleyan’s chalking ban is facially unenforceable because it violates Connecticut state law, specifically Connecticut General Statute §31-51q, which, in brief, protects some employee speech from infringement by an employer. The chalking ban is overbroad in that it prohibits some legally protected speech—for example, that of students who are employed by the University—and therefore is an invalid policy that should no longer be imposed until sufficient considerations are made regarding free speech rights on campus. Federal Constitutional Protections of Free Speech The First Amendment to the United States Constitution affirms that “Congress shall pass no law…abridging the freedom of speech.” Although the Free Speech Clause now applies to state governments under the Fourteenth Amendment, Gitlow v. New York (1925), constitutional protections in general do not ordinarily extend to infringements by private actors. DeShaney v. Winnebago County(1989). This is to say, for example, that an individual does not have the constitutional right to enter the house of another person to preach to her. Private actors, such as people or institutions that are not affiliated with the government, are able to infringe upon the speech of others without constitutional recourse. Thus, the first question to ask when determining the legality of the chalking ban is whether the University is itself a private actor. In Marsh v. Alabama (1946), the Supreme Court found that “the more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.” However, in Rendell-Baker v. Kohn (1982), the Court later refused to consider a privately owned school to be a state actor, even though the school received money from the government and the school served a genuine public function. It appears, then, that there is little argument that could be made that Wesleyan University is not a private actor for the purposes of the First Amendment. However, there are a few caveats in the jurisprudence subsequent to Marsh that require exploration. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins (1980), for example, suggests that, although limitations on speech by private actors may not trigger federal protection, state constitutions may confer expanded speech rights than the federal constitution requires. In this case, the Court determined that the California state constitution codified much broader protections for free speech than the federal constitution, and the more expansive state constitution should be respected in instances such as these. Similarly, Hudgens v. NLRB (1976) explains that state laws “may in some situations extend protection or provide redress against a private corporation or person who seeks to abridge the free expression of others.” Thus, if we do not dispute the claim that Wesleyan is a private actor, it appears from Marsh, Hudgens, and PruneYard that the University may still be limited on the types of speech it can infringe upon by both the Connecticut state constitution and also state law. Shannon Welch/Photo Editor Connecticut State Constitutional Protections on Free Speech Following PruneYard, the state constitution may trigger broader free speech protections than the federal constitution. For the purposes of free speech, the most relevant sections of the Connecticut Constitution would include §4 “Every citizen may freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty” and §14 “The citizens have a right, in a peaceable manner, to assemble for their common good, and to apply those invested with the powers of government, for redress of grievances, or other proper purposes, by petition, address, or remonstrance.” (For religious speech, §3 will also be implicated.) According to the Connecticut Supreme Court, however, the Connecticut Constitution is not expansive enough to protect speech against infringement by private actors. In Cologne v. Westfarms Associates (1984), the state court determined that there was “no evidence [in the Connecticut Constitution] of any intention to vest in those seeking to exercise such rights as free speech and petition the privilege of doing so upon the property of others” (on page 59 suggesting that this even applies to private university property). Thus, unlike California in PruneYard (or New Jersey, Colorado, Oregon, Massachusetts, Washington, and Pennsylvania similarly), the state constitution of Connecticut does not enshrine free speech protections when dealing with private actors. Connecticut Statutory Protections on Free Speech However, as noted in PruneYard, “a state may adopt, in its own constitution, individual liberties more expansive than those conferred by the federal constitution and a statute is, for that purpose, in the same category as a state constitution.”  Thus, it is possible that some refuge can be found in state law for questioning the legality of the chalking ban. Although there is no statute that protects all individuals from having their speech restrained by private actors, there appears to be some limitations that exist specifically to protect the speech of employees. Connecticut General Statute §31-51q holds that “Any employer…who subjects any employee to discipline or discharge on account of the exercise by such employee of rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the United States Constitution or section 3, 4, or 14 of article first of the Constitution of the state, provided such activity does not substantially or materially interfere with the employee’s bona fide job performance or the working relationship between the employee and employer, shall be liable to such employee for damages caused by such discipline or discharge…” Simply put, employees are afforded legal protections against discipline or discharge from their employers for speech if (1) that speech is otherwise constitutionally protected, and (2) that speech does not substantially interfere with job performance or a working relationship. This understanding, albeit somewhat more limited, was affirmed by the Connecticut Supreme Court in Cotto v. United Technologies (1999): “We conclude that §31-51q applies to some activities and speech that occur at the workplace because…there is no prohibition that prevents a legislature from protecting employee speech wherever it occurs.” However, Cotto did provide some further qualifications. According to Cotto, §31-51q parallels federal statute 42 U.S.C. §1983, and thus Supreme Court interpretations of that law should inform state law as well. According to the Supreme Court in Waters v. Churchill  (1994), in order to be protected by Section 1983, “the speech must be on a matter of public concern, and the employee’s interest in expressing himself on this matter must not be outweighed by any injury the speech could cause” to employee relationships. Similarly, in Connick v. Myers (1983), the Court found that “conduct at a governmental employer’s workplace is not constitutionally protected unless the expressive activity concerns a matter of public, social, or other concern to the country.” Finally, although not mentioned in Cotto because it was not at issue in the facts of the case, Section 1983 can also protect religious speech, including religious speech that does not abut national concerns. Rosenberger v. University of Virginia (1995). Following the Court in Cotto, it therefore appears that any employee, including student employees, can invoke §31-51q for employer discipline as a result of their speech if  (1) the speech is otherwise constitutionally protected, (2) the speech does not substantially interfere with job performance or the working relationship, and (3) the speech is either religious or of pressing national concern. To be sure, there exist some forms of speech that can meet all three above requirements. As a result, the University cannot, without second thought to civil liberties, ban any and all speech that it dislikes. In the state of Connecticut, some speech cannot be infringed upon, even by private employers. For chalking to be protected by §31-51q, we must first argue that chalking is constitutionally protected speech. From there, it would likely be most useful to next argue that the moratorium is facially invalid because of overbreadth—it does not allow for speech that withstands prongs two and three above to survive on University campus despite legal protection.

"University to Host First Diversity Awards Ceremony","2013-04-11","by Millie Dent, Assistant News Editor","On April 28, the University will host the first Edgar Beckham Helping Hands Award Ceremony. The event will celebrate and recognize exemplary students who have exhibited cultural sensitivity and who promote diversity and inclusion. Phabinly Gabriel ’13 and Luciana Pennant ’13 initiated the award ceremony on campus. Gabriel explained the award is named after the University’s first African American dean. “[Beckham] was an advocate for diversity in education and academic excellence,” Gabriel said. “Basically, we made the program originally to celebrate students who have done well academically and have done some form of civic engagement toward the Wesleyan campus.” University President Michael Roth praised the efforts of Gabriel and Pennant. He said he believes the awards ceremony is a way to unite members of the University community. “The best part about it is that it’s a student initiative,” Roth said. “It’s meant to help build community and to recognize people who are being helpful in that endeavor.” Vice President for Institutional Partnerships and Chief Diversity Officer Sonia Mañjon supported both Gabriel and Pennant with their endeavors. Mañjon noted that the University needs an occassion such as this to contrast with recent events. “[I learned about the ceremony] right after the big scenario that happened at the Connecticut Science Center with the senior class,” Mañjon said. “So I’m thinking we need to do something that’s on campus, that’s not an opportunity for students to just drink and pass out and get drunk…So I am very much supportive of the idea and impressed with what they [have] done in the short amount of time that they’ve had to coordinate it.” The awards ceremony will honor two freshmen, two sophomores, two juniors, and eight seniors. The organizers plan to use results from various surveys in the future to refine the program in years to come. “We’re really hoping that this will turn into a tradition and grow larger,” Gabriel said. Ten to twelve faculty and staff will receive awards for their advisory roles for students. “We know that there are a lot of students who have been under a faculty or staff member who have pointed them in the right direction, [and] kept them encouraged through their years, or throughout some time,” Pennant said. “Or, if they didn’t do it, then they at least pointed [the students] in the right direction as to who to go to.” Gabriel and Pennant believe it is important to include all class years in the event, so that everyone in the community has a specific goal toward which to work. They hope that underclassmen will recognize and act on behalf of the greater needs of the University community. “We wanted to make sure to include freshman and sophomores, because when [they] come in…they don’t have this idea that you have got to buckle down,” Pennant said. “…We really believe that recognition brings about more encouragement for people to do better and it holds them accountable for their actions.” Students are nominated by faculty, staff, or fellow students; self-nomination is prohibited. Short blurbs accompany the nomination and final decisions are chosen by a jury committee of alumni who are at least five years removed from the graduating class. Students also vote for faculty and staff awards through an email survey. Gabriel said he hopes alumni engagement in both the voting process and the ceremony will help students foster connections for post-graduate plans. “By allowing [alumni] to come and interact with us in this celebration, [students] can really network, build connections, maybe even land a summer internship or help them land a certain connection that would help them find a future job,” Gabriel said. “This really gives a glimpse of what Wesleyan alumni are doing, how they have progressed from being students at Wesleyan to prominent alumni currently.” All students are encouraged to sign up for the event, although space is limited to about 30 students per class year. Tickets are $20, but faculty members can sponsor students. “We don’t need to be in the news again for destroying the science center,” Pennant said. “We don’t need to be in the news for Holi for the whole world to hear about us. We don’t need to be in the news again for the forum. We need something positive and we need everyone to keep experiencing the positive things at Wesleyan so that when they leave they actually enjoy being alumni.” Mañjon hopes this will encourage seniors to focus more on helping the community and each other. “I’m hoping…that they embark on senior activities that are more about giving back to the community,” Mañjon said. “Last year I worked with the senior class on an event in the spring where they literally worked with the community, the vendors on Main Street, to do a cleanup and to just bring visibility to the campus-community partnerships. It was a way for seniors to really recognize this larger community, not just Wesleyan, but Middletown, and really give back in their last year. So I’m hoping the senior classes will really look more towards these types of activities in the future.”"
"Startup Showcase To Feature Alumni Work","2014-04-30","by Jenny Davis, Assistant Opinion Editor","On Sunday, May 4, the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship will welcome four alumni and one group of current students to present at the Spring Alumni Startup Showcase. The event will be held in the Olson Commons in the Career Center. “Our hope is that events like this will give students an inside look at startup culture and illuminate some pros and cons of working in a small, entrepreneurial setting,” Director of the Patricelli Center Makaela Kingsley ’98 wrote in an email to The Argus. “We also aim to connect students directly with alumni and cultivate a community of innovative Wesleyan people across generations.” Sunday’s participants are Art Feltman ’80, Founder of International Hartford; Ysette Guevara ’98, Founder and CEO of Minds on Fire; Liza Conrad ’11, Fundraising and Operations Manager of Girls Who Code; Zach Valenti ’12, Founder and CEO of Project Uplift and Beastly Productions; and Kwaku Akoi ’14, Founder of JóòMah. JóòMah, the sole group consisting of current students, was founded by Akoi last year. His team includes Sam Giagtzoglou ’16, Oladoyin Oladapo ’14, Olayinka Lawal ’15, Maxwell Dietz ’16, Geofery Yatich ’16, and Michael Yee ’14. JóòMah, a web platform that connects job seekers in Sub-Saharan Africa to employment opportunities near them, has been in development since last June. Though it is a relatively recent startup, Akoi anticipates that it will have an enormous effect in Sub-Saharan Africa and potentially in other regions. “We’re looking at a culture of employment that’s going to change,” Akoi said. “We’re hoping to tackle the problem of accessibility to jobs. If someone could sit on a bus, looking for job opportunities on their phone, receiving notifications from employers who might be looking for them, it’s democratizing the process. We are leveling the playing field for all job seekers so that it will no more be the ones from big-name schools or with powerful relatives who will have access to the best job opportunities out there.” Moreover, Akoi pointed out, connecting job seekers to employers and vice versa will have a widespread impact on the economy. “Giving someone a better job opportunity gives them more income mobility,” he said. “Giving them access to better income would transfer into better revenues for the African governments in terms of taxes. People could save more, too, and afford better education and better healthcare. I want to see JóòMah become a new and more effective way of combating poverty, which is endemic in many African countries.” Valenti, Founder and CEO of Project Uplift and Beastly Productions, is also hoping to bring about a culture shift, this one focused around mental health. “I think about [Project Uplift] as a mental health awareness campaign, and primarily what we do is bring a massive biofeedback-powered tower that we built,” Valenti said. “We guide people in a mindfulness exercise that cultivates the breath. Within a few minutes, users trigger the fan at the base to turn on, and that lifts up the planet earth beach ball. By uplifting yourself, you physically lift up the world.” Though Project Uplift is just one of Valenti’s enterprises, he has big dreams for the still-growing event service. “From the beginning, my vision was to do a national tour in a rock ‘n’ roll tour bus with a swath of professionals in different fields, from behavior therapy to yoga,” Valenti said. “The intention is to lessen the stigma and raise awareness about existing resources on college campuses. I kept hearing how much they’re spending and the amazing array of resources that are available, but the engagement isn’t correlating.” Akoi stressed that the journey to entrepreneurship is a personal one: he realized the need for a company like JóòMah when he went back to his native Ghana after his sophomore year and witnessed firsthand the difficulty that talented job seekers faced in finding employment. Instead of dispensing advice, he sees encouraging younger entrepreneurs as his most important duty to those beginning to consider a startup. “More than great advice or insight, the big thing is for them to be encouraged, inspired,” he said. “It’s not easy. It requires a lot of perseverance, focus, and drive to keep going in spite of setbacks. Feeling discouraged kills a person’s drive and passion very quickly.” Valenti agreed that supporting young entrepreneurs at this weekend’s showcase is crucial. “I am really looking forward to giving hope that it’s totally possible,” he said. “Connecting with students who have big dreams and giving them access to how to execute things while staying as sane as possible is important. Burnout in the startup world is really high, because people throw themselves full force into ventures with no guarantee of success.” Civic Engagement Fellow Jelisa Adair ’13 explained that the Patricelli Center tries to strike a delicate balance between bringing alumni back to campus and launching students’ projects out into the world. “It has to be both, and so far it has been both,” she said. “One thing you’ll realize once you leave Wes is that you’re inducted into a realm of alumni. Not many people get a job from just applying. It’s who you know. Getting alumni back not only allows them to connect with students who are here, but also gives them something to latch onto, new experiences to connect to.” Adair also sees potential for the showcase’s presenters to act as mentors for students. “If you go to your friends, they’ll tell you the same things over and over,” she said. “You need people who can think critically and help the project grow. [The presenters] come back because they know there’ll be student interaction. Mentorship is easier to give than financial support or a job. I definitely saw that happen at our last showcase, and I hope to see it happen again.” Kingsley pointed out that student entrepreneurs stand to gain a lot by connecting with their older, more experienced, counterparts. “Student entrepreneurs face the same challenges as all entrepreneurs: proving that their idea fills an existing need in an innovative way, finding key allies and collaborators, compiling resources, and remaining nimble while staying true to the mission—to name just a few,” she wrote. “Students have the added challenge of juggling their entrepreneurial work with their academic pursuits—which is no easy feat. This event is just one of many ways that students with an interest in or curiosity about entrepreneurship can find support to weather these challenges.”"
"University Creates Equity Compliance Director Position","2014-05-01","by Matt Shelley-Reade, Staff Writer","The University is introducing a new full-time position in the Office of Equity and Inclusion, the Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator. The new employee will be responsible for ensuring that the University’s policies and practices comply with Title IX, Title VII, and other Equal Opportunity laws at both the federal and state levels. The search has currently been narrowed to three candidates: Catherine Rombeau, Lance Houston and Deborah Colucci. Title IX of the Educational Amendments Acts of 1972 prohibits educational institutions from discriminating on the basis of sex, while Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, religion, sex, or ethnicity. “The Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator will coordinate, conduct informal and formal investigations, provide and monitor training programs with respect to equal opportunity and discrimination issues,” the Careers at Wesleyan website reads. This past week, the University hosted separated forums for each candidate. Rombeau spoke on Friday, April 25; Houston spoke Wednesday, April 30; and Colucci spoke yesterday, May 1. Each forum had the same structure, beginning with an introduction of the candidate, followed by a Title VII and Title IX training session, and finally concluded with a Q&A section. Community participation was encouraged in both the candidate search process and open forums. Vice President for Equity and Inclusion and Title IX Officer Antonio Farias headed the search committee, which was comprised of Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students Rick Culliton, WSA Student Affairs Committee Chair Kate Cullen ’16, Director of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Jennifer D’Andrea, and Interim Captain of Public Safety Paul Verrillo. Farias commented on the process of choosing a candidate and on the format of the open forum. “This is the Wesleyan process,” Farias said. “…For the the director level, you go through the full day process, and you have a community discussion…. I think for the community, particularly with this issue right now—Title VII and Title IX—it’s a hyper salient conversation, so it makes sense to have an open forum discussion. There’s also a certain level of skill the search committee wants to see in person—the performative aspect of the job.” Cullen spoke to the importance of community engagement in regard to the Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator, a position that will undoubtedly deal with sexual assault on campus. “I expect a good student turnout as sexual assault and Title IX is a hot issue on campus,” Cullen wrote in an email to The Argus. “I also hope we can engage in a meaningful dialogue with the candidates since this truly is an important job that will hopefully have a big impact on campus.” D’Andrea commented on the search process, explaining the qualifications they were looking for in each candidate. “The university conducted a national search to identify qualified candidates for this position,” D’Andrea wrote in an email to The Argus. “All three candidates possess a wealth of knowledge in the area of Title IX and Title VII, and are motivated to work with students in a higher education setting.” In their presentations, the candidates were tasked with offering training on Title VII and Title IX. In addition, candidates scrutinized potential areas of confusion between the two anti-discrimination laws, often offering fictional discrimination situations. Farias spoke on the importance of distinguishing between the two different laws. “Lots of people are experts in Title VII [and] you have less folks…[who] are experts in Title IX,” Farias said. “I need somebody who can cross both streams…. We’re…looking for a dynamic person that understands and has a full grasp of those laws and is able to function in the Wesleyan ecosphere—understanding that they’re not only going to be dealing with faculty; they’re going to be dealing with Wesleyan students, they’re going to be dealing with staff, and they’re going to be dealing with all three of those simultaneously at any given point.” D’Andrea furthered Farias’ point, exploring the capacity for each candidate to work with students. “[A]s director of CAPS, I am deeply invested in the selection of the person who will be interacting with students who come forward with Title IX and Title [VII] issues,” D’Andrea wrote in an email to The Argus. “[I]t is important to me that we select a candidate who is an expert in this area, and who possesses the sensitivity and interpersonal skills to effectively interact with students in the course of doing this very difficult work.” Civic Engagement Fellow Jelisa Adair ’13, who attended Houston’s open forum, commented on her unique perspective on the selection process. “Coming from being…a student and now becoming a staff member, I’m able to so much more clearly see the way we treat staff versus the way that we treat students,” Adair said. “I’ve had training like this before, but I never had training like this as a student…. It’s important that whoever we get in this position is able to relay this information to the student body, because I don’t think it has been done before in a good way.”"
"The Remote Vote: Absentee, But Not Absentminded","2014-10-23","by Taylor Leet-Otley, Staff Writer","Presented with the choice of voting absentee in their hometowns or as Middletown residents, students cast their ballots where they count most.At the dawn of a fresh round of elections, many Wesleyan students are gearing up for the polls, as are hoards of college students across the country. According to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, college-educated young people were among the most well-represented in the 2012 elections. College students flocked to the polls en masse, favoring Barack Obama by a 23-point margin. However, polls by the Pew Research Center after the 2012 presidential election suggested that fewer young voters registered for that election than for the previous one in 2008, down 11 points from 66 to 55 percent. Many speculated that this was partially due to diminished enthusiasm compared to the 2008 campaign, while others pointed to a slew of controversial voter ID and early registration laws that had been implemented in many states in the months leading up to the 2012 election. Nevertheless, young people traditionally show a lower turnout than their older counterparts regardless of the election, and their overall numbers in non-presidential elections have historically been much lower than in presidential elections. With elections approaching on Nov. 4, political outlets are abuzz with information about upcoming congressional, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections, including 435 seats for the biannual House election, 36 Senate seats, including 3 up for special election; and 36 governors’ offices. Among these is the race between current Democratic Governor of Connecticut Dannel Malloy and the Republican nominee Tom Foley, who lost to Malloy by a narrow margin in the 2010 gubernatorial election. Malloy visited campus in early June to commemorate the opening of Wesleyan’s new auxiliary power micro-grid, which received state funding as part of an ongoing energy project in Connecticut. For those hoping to vote in the election, voting laws in Connecticut have become a focus of controversy in recent months. Connecticut voter laws are relatively strict compared to those in other New England states, forbidding absentee voting without an approved excuse. Veronica Birdsall ’15, a resident of Litchfield, Conn., is currently registered to vote with her home address. “Honestly, they don’t really follow up on whether your excuse is legit,” Birdsall said. “Honestly [I am registered in Litchfield] mostly because I had already registered there in high school and didn’t feel like going through the process of changing it.” Birdsall also spoke in support of a referendum on the ballot in the upcoming election to ease some of Connecticut’s early voting restrictions. “[It’s] not too bad since I had an excuse,” she said. “I couldn’t come home on Election Day due to lack of transportation…. But on the ballot is an Amendment to the Connecticut constitution to implement no-excuse absentee voting! So I voted for that.” Earl Lin ’15 of New Haven, Conn. is also registered to vote in his home district. “I’ve been registered at my home address in New Haven since I turned 18 and became eligible to vote,” he said. “Since it’s only about half an hour away and I wanted to continue voting in municipal primarily, mayoral, [and] aldermanic elections at home, it seemed most convenient and to make the most sense to keep my registration in New Haven.” However, in the past, he has chosen to vote absentee. “I did vote absentee for at least one election, but since one of the reasons for requesting an absentee ballot is that one is absent from town during an election, it was pretty straightforward to request a ballot,” Lin said. “I actually didn’t realize no-excuse voting was something some states do. I think it would be better if Connecticut offered early voting, though, as absentee ballots are sometimes not even counted unless the election is close. Regardless of its impact on the election, it’s nice to know that your vote has actually been counted.” In 2012, Connecticut legislators approved a law legalizing online voting in the state. The online voter registration form is run by the Office of the Secretary of the State, and voters can use the website to register anew, as well as register with a change of address. The site closed on Thursday, Oct. 22 and will remain closed until election day. For students coming from other states, however, there is also the consideration of whether to register in their home states or in Connecticut. Andreas Streuli ’15 has voted in his home state of California for previous elections. “I voted in 2012 out of state,” he said. “San Mateo County constantly sends me materials. I think I may be registered in Connecticut now because I keep getting called for jury duty.” Streuli listed among his reasons for voting out of state a feeling that his vote would go further in California, which receives 55 electoral votes in presidential elections compared with Connecticut’s 7. “I’m afraid my reason for registering to vote in California was just because it holds quite a bit more influence than Connecticut,” Streuli said. Matthew Conley ’15 of New York, another state that tends to vote consistently Democratic in elections, echoed Streuli’s sentiments. “I’m from New York, so I’m voting between two very blue states,” Conley said. “So where I register to vote in any given race depends on who has a more competitive congressional or senatorial race in a given cycle.” Conley also expressed interest in out-of-state voting due to differences in state politics. “I volunteered for a state Senate campaign the summer between my freshman and sophomore years,” he said. “Honestly, state legislature is where important decisions are made, and state legislature in New York is weird because it’s much more heavily Republican than the state as a whole in national elections.” For students considering voting in Connecticut who have yet to register, forms can still be returned in person at the Registrar’s office by Oct. 28. Additionally, vans will be running between Usdan and local polling centers on Nov. 4 for students voting in local elections."
"A Belated Holiday Gift to Alma Mater: A Set of New Year’s Resolutions","2015-01-25","by Jason Shatz, Class of 2014","The year is young, and the semester brand new. From my armchair, I would like to propose a list of resolutions for the Wesleyan community. This is not meant to be exhaustive – I would be disappointed if additions were not presented. But here are five to start. 1. Commit to re-establishing trust on campus. The defining characteristic of 2014, both at Wesleyan and beyond, was turbulence. At Wesleyan, I observed a sad irony: the student body contains thoughtful young men and women who are eager expand their social and intellectual horizons – and yet it dangerously divided. Furthermore, students operate in a troubling zeitgeist, one filled with distrust. For example, many students do not trust the administration or Public Safety. The first thing that members of the Wesleyan community must do, therefore, is to commit to a new era where trust, transparency, and integrity are the norm. It needs to revitalize the Honor Code and the Code of Non-Academic Conduct. As a whole, this code needs to be revisited, updated, and put at the forefront of student life. 2. Improve campus safety The new Public Safety chief has been dealt a tough hand. A skeptical student body, a history of inappropriate officer behavior, a disturbing uptick in sexual violence – and that is just the tip of the iceberg. The department has started to enact overdue reforms to Wesleyan’s nightlife, including the enforcement of fire codes at concerts and in wood-frame houses. In order for the social scene to re-emerge, students must work with Public Safety and the administration to address the problems in campus safety. Most pressingly, the community must address the dangers that women face on campus – I want to add my appreciation for the hard work that students have done to illuminate them. Members of the community may disagree on the means, but they must share both the goal of improving campus safety for all – and mutual commitment of good faith toward that end. 3. Continue to fix Wesleyan’s fiscal woes. Since the Great Recession, Wesleyan has struggled to keep its endowment in decent shape, and the financial aid model had to be changed. Returning to the beloved model – 100% need blind for domestic applicants – would be nice, but Wesleyan should not do so if it is financially unsustainable. It needs to find a balance that provides the most possible assistance to needy students while not squeezing out the middle class. 4. Enrich the academic experience Wesleyan may be praised for its academics and the sheer breadth of intellectual thought that emanates from the community. But it does not adequately emphasize that set of core values that students deem essential – creativity, depth and breadth of critical thought, civic engagement, social justice. Some of these values are innate to the open curriculum, but others are not as prominent. I suggest codifying those values through new academic traditions. Firstly, core requirements rather than just general education expectations (or, for that matter, expectations that orientation spiels will stick for all four years). For example, consider a “diversity” requirement that asks students to take classes about different cultures. Whether through foreign-language classes or history classes – or many other types – there will be many ways to satisfy it. Secondly, expanding the “living and learning” program for freshmen (eventually for all freshmen, as Skidmore does). More educators would teach interdisciplinary courses with emphases on the aforementioned values, and students will live with peers who share at least one common interest – easing the transition to college and better facilitating the formation of lifelong friendships. Wesleyan also needs to better prepare students for the workplace. From revitalizing the Career Center to adding workshops for new apps and other important tools, Wesleyan needs to increase – in frequency and in quality – the scope of its efforts. In addition, Wesleyan should ensure that all students have ways to earn academic credit for internships. Employers would obviously love to have student interns, especially if they can compensate with academic credit instead of pay. Students, in turn, can remove a year from the four-year experience and save a year’s worth of money. 5. Revitalize Wesleyan’s social life. Only after Wesleyan ensures campus safety can Wesleyan’s social scene be truly revived. And it must re-emerge as son as possible, for a healthy social scene is crucial for the growth of all students. The shuttering of two fraternity houses, while justified, deprives Wesleyan of two large social spaces at a turbulent time. We need more spaces like those, especially in turbulent times like these. The only spaces that could possibly fit the student body are Foss Hill and the hockey rink. Working with Public Safety, students need to take advantage of existing facilities and create new, regulated environments for gatherings. Hopefully, more traditions will arise and unite the body of students now and to come."
"Students and Faculty Discuss Unpaid Internships at First Allbritton Talk","2015-02-02","by Tess Morgan, News Editor","Civic Engagement Fellow Rosy Capron organized a series of discussions about public life, the first of which focused on unpaid internships.c/o Rosy Capron On Friday, Jan. 30, students and faculty gathered in the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life for the first in a series of discussions sponsored by the Center. Simply named “Allbritton Talks,” the series was created by Rosy Capron ’14, the University’s 2014-2015 Civic Engagement Fellow, and seeks to bring community members together for meaningful conversations about public life. The first talk focused on the rise and morality of unpaid internships. Capron explained the motivation that spurred the series’ creation. “Part of the inspiration was thinking about ‘What is public life?’” Capron said. “We have the Allbritton Center, which has classes and hosts speakers, but we haven’t had much of an opportunity to bring students into the fold, to ask them, ‘What does it mean to examine our public life? What does it mean to have a public life?’” One important aspect of the series is that it draws students and faculty from all walks of life to discuss common issues. Capron stated that in the discussions she hopes to recreate and build on the conversations students have with their friends. “I [created the series] thinking about really great conversations that I have with students and that I had when I was a student about political topics and current events,” Capron said. “It’s important to also have those conversations outside of your friend group with people who are less likely to agree with everything you say, to be confronted with difference and to grapple with these issues.” The topic of the first discussion, unpaid internships, was selected as a non-controversial way to begin the series, according to Capron. One attendee, Alicia Gansley ’15, expressed her satisfaction with the outcome of the discussion. “I thought it was a great chance to meet with staff members and students to talk about a really hot button issue for Wesleyan students and students across the country,” Gansley said. “Everyone was respectful and engaged, and I enjoyed it.” Despite never having had an unpaid internship, Gansley said that she still felt included in the discussion. “I feel like the topic [still applied to me], because as we talked about, for some people, including me, unpaid internships aren’t a reality or a choice that we have, so I’m [glad] I got to have a voice in the conversation, saying, ‘It’s just not the same for everyone,’” Gansley said. “I’m doing the Civic Engagement certificate so this is sort of right up my ally. I think it’s a great way to institutionalize the conversations we have in our dorms and around school.” Joli Holmes ’17, another attendee, stated that she enjoyed having a conversation about public life with like-minded students. “I enjoyed the experience because you don’t get to have these types of conversations in class,” Holmes said. “It’s an out-of-class experience where you’re still learning and discussing important and meaningful topics. I think a lot of students could benefit from this type of conversation.” Holmes described her experience at the first talk and her willingness to continue to engage in these types of conversations. “I would absolutely come to another talk,” Holmes said. “I think it depends on the subject matter, of course, but if they are structured like this I would come. It was a good size, too. It would be good to include more people, but at the same time it would be harder to have this type of conversation with a larger group.” Capron echoed these sentiments, stating her excitement for future discussions, which might be about more controversial topics. “I was happy to have students as well as staff and administrators there,” Capron said. “I’m curious to see how it will be with different sized groups and other topics. We started with [the topic of] unpaid internships because it’s of relevance to students but it isn’t necessarily divisive and intense and everyone can speak from their own experiences, but it will be interesting to hear the conversations [that arise] from more controversial topics. We definitely want [topics] that people will get excited about and be passionate about; we just don’t want to be exclusive. We’re going to be branching out and we would love to get people riled up as long as it’s a good atmosphere and it doesn’t get personal. Getting heated isn’t a bad thing.” The calendar for the talks is still undecided; however, Capron hopes they will become a weekly event. “The goal was to have these conversations weekly, and if students want to keep having them, we will,” Capron said. “It doesn’t take a lot of time or money to have people sit in a room and chat. We want to be flexible and respond to current events that come up. I hope people submit topics that are of interest to them so that we can [incorporate them] into our conversations.”"
"Carnegie Foundation Awards University 2015 Community Engagement Classification","2015-02-19","by Kathy Yun, Staff Writer","c/o wesleyan.edu The Carnegie Foundation recently selected the University for its 2015 Community Engagement Classification. The award is for institutions that have demonstrated community engagement and founded on evidence-based documentation. The University was also selected for this recognition in 2008. According to the New England Resource Center for Higher Education, the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification considers community engagement a collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. “We did our initial application in 2008, and it’s an extensive process where they ask numbers such as how many learning classes we have, how many professors are engaged, how many students take these classes, specific examples of partnerships and how they have developed, outcomes, and how the community is involved in all of this,” said Director of Center for Community Partnerships Cathy Lechowicz. “This time around, they ask you what has changed since last time, and how you have further engaged with the community.” The projects and activities considered in this Classification involve not just the participation of students, administrators, and professors, but also the community members. According to Lechowicz, the community is Middletown-centric, but can also range from Connecticut to even larger areas. “The whole idea is that the engagement isn’t just about the University, but that it’s about working in the world and how to engage the world in the work that you’re doing,” Lechowicz said. “It’s a partnership where you work with agencies and individuals to try to address some public need or some public project.” The University has accomplished major achievements since its classification in 2010. These include institutional advances such as the establishment of the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, which both did not exist five years ago. Specific projects include the establishment of the Center for Prison Education and the growth of WesReads and WesMath—both of which started out with half a dozen students and currently have more than 70 students who go to the Macdonough School in Middletown on a regular basis. Director of Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship Makaela Kingsley shared her views on the importance of community engagement. “At the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, we believe that community engagement and collaboration are paramount to all social impact work,” Kingsley said. “In fact, innovation or ‘charity’ alone—without cultural competence and involvement by relevant communities—can be destructive. Wesleyan students are better entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs because our students and faculty are highly engaged citizens.” Lechowicz added that the challenge of the institution is helping students to develop these projects and provide them that autonomy that many of the students want, while also providing institutional support for them in a way they can further their project. Another example of the University’s community engagement is the Green Street Teaching and Learning Center, a community-based studio that engages different members of the Middletown community such as students and faculty, local artists, and faculty from Middletown Community College. Most of the classes offered a combination of math and science with art and are taught to students of grades 1-8. Director of the Service-Learning Center Barbara Juhasz commented on the role of this organization. “Green Street is a wonderful example of community partnership that functions in so many different ways that involves students on a regular basis, involves faculty in service-learning courses, and provides a great mechanism for students to be more involved in the community,” Juhasz said. Anna Flurry ’17, student coordinator for Green Street Teaching and Learning Center, commented on what the organization has to offer in terms of community engagement. “Green Street offers this great opportunity for Wesleyan students to get out of the college bubble and interact with the Middletown community in a positive way,” Flurry said. “I think it’s really important to be aware that we’re part of a much bigger community called Middletown. We’ve been able to create many connections with the town around us, which has enabled us to get rid of the idea of otherness. I personally feel like I have a much stronger connection to Middletown.” Through this partnership, the Carnegie Foundation provides classified institutions with feedback on general themes throughout the application process such as insight in areas they can focus on and develop. Lechowicz praised the helpfulness of this process. “We talk with other schools and work with other people, but you certainly have your blinders on in a sense, Lechowics said. “It’s nice to get feedback from outside folks and the framework for engagement they provide.” The next opportunity to apply for Classification will be 10 years from now. This is an extension of the prior five years due to existing partnership, which shows the plan for the long-term relationship the Foundation and the University will have. For information on how to get involved, engagement work on campus, and community events, students can sign up for the ENGAGED newsletter or the Civic Engagement Fellow newsletter."
"Scholars in Action Host Enrichment Days","2015-04-16","by Katya Dajani, Staff Writer","On April 22 and May 5, Scholars in Action, a student group that tutors students at local middle schools, will be hosting its first ever Wesleyan Enrichment Days.Scholars in Action, a student group that tutors students at local middle schools, will be hosting its first ever Wesleyan Enrichment Days. The Enrichment Days, on Wednesday, April 22 and Tuesday, May 5, will take place on Foss Hill and offer a number of workshops to students from schools such as Keigwin Middle School and Woodrow Wilson Middle School. Event organizers, Lily Wittrock ’16 and Rebecca Brand ’16, are currently looking for individuals and groups on campus who would be interested in leading workshops on a variety of different topics. “These Enrichment Days are something we have been planning on doing with our kids [since] this group’s inception,” Wittrock and Brand wrote in an email to The Argus. “We go to Keigwin and Woodrow Wilson every week during their after school program to help with homework, and their enrichment activities (yoga, cooking, video game design, swimming, poetry). We are inviting the students to [the University] as an extension of the work we do with them every week creating a fun, educational environment.” The two hope to help bridge the gap between the University and the Middletown community through Enrichment Day workshops. Potential topics include drawing, dance, science, and creative writing. In addition to these workshops, the days will include a campus tour and other activities. “We are planning on starting with a big icebreaker outside, then taking tours around campus with [University] students,” Wittrock and Brand wrote. “After that, we will break out into smaller groups to participate in activities led by…student groups.” According to the University’s ENGAGE blog, the workshops are expected to include 5 to 15 students for an engaging 40 minutes. “If you are interested in education or just feel like frolicking on Foss with some hilarious preteens, then this may be the low-commitment opportunity for you,” the blog reads. The organizers are hoping to work with different program houses, as well as student groups, to ensure that the days will allow the middle school students a glimpse of college life. In addition, the organizers wish to motivate students to attend colleges while also providing time for them to socialize with University students outside the classroom. Rosy Capron ’14, a Civic Engagement Fellow at the University’s Center for Community Partnerships, has assisted in getting the project underway. “Middle schoolers don’t know very much about what people study and do for fun in college, especially at a liberal arts college,” Capron said. “They take ‘Language Arts,’ ‘Social Studies,’ and ‘Science,’ not ‘Chinese Poetry,’ ‘Latin American History,’ or ‘Conservation Biology.’ The enrichment days are a great way for them to learn about the academic and extracurricular activities that make college worthwhile.” She added that this event is the first of its kind in recent years. “Students from the Middletown area come to campus for High School Humanities and programs in the Davison Arts Center, Van Vleck Observatory, and Mansfield Freeman Center, but I don’t believe we’ve tried anything very similar to the Enrichment Days in recent years,” Capron said. The feedback from the student body has so far been positive. Scholars in Action have been working alongside the Office of Community Service to ensure that the day is possible. “There are a lot of other groups that tutor in Middletown schools during the day but ours is the first specifically working with an established, structured after-school program for middle schoolers,” wrote Wittrock and Brand."
"Haffner ’76 Reflects on Life as a “Sexologist Minister”","2015-04-23","by Hyunji Ward, Assistant News Editor","Debra Haffner ’76 returned to the University on Wednesday, April 22, to deliver a lecture entitled, “Lessons from a Life in Sex and Ministry,” sponsored by The Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. As an undergraduate, Haffner was co-founder of the University’s first Women’s Center, and went on to hold leadership roles at Planned Parenthood, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SEICUS), and other not-for-profit organizations. Most recently she founded The Religious Institute, a multi-faith organization advocating for justice, sexual health, and education in faith communities and society at large. Now, she describes herself as a “Sexologist Minister.” Haffner began by describing her time at the University and the impact her undergraduate education had on her career. “Wesleyan launched my career in many ways… but not in the ways that I had expected,” Haffner said. “I came to campus in the fall of 1972. I was the second class of women who came in as freshmen, and I think that’s pretty hard to imagine today…. Women like me were still coming to college with the parental message that we were here to find a career that we could fall back on if our husbands died or left us.” Haffner noted that abortion was still illegal in Connecticut. Reflecting on her own experiences, and those of other female students, in terms of sexual misconduct, she emphasized the absence of terms or concepts like “date rape” or “sexual harassment.” “My sophomore year I took a women’s studies class,” Haffner said. “This course just exploded my world. All of a sudden, I was able to make sense of all those conflicting messages and was able to own who I was.” Haffner cites this class as the beginning of her career as a sex educator. She partnered with a fellow student, was given a $500 budget by the University, and founded the Wesleyan Women’s Center. “We struck for a gynecologist…this old guy who didn’t know how to do pelvic [exams], was not okay with us,” Haffner said. “We organized consciousness-raising groups, which were groups of women, but [also] co-ed, so women and men could talk about the impact of sexism growing up. We brought people to campus to teach women how to do plumbing and car repair.” After attending a women’s workshop organized by Our Bodies, Ourselves—in which the female workshop facilitator got up on a table, inserted a speculum into her vagina, and offered workshop attendees a flashlight with which to examine her cervix—Haffner and her colleague began hosting the same workshop every other week in Exley Science Center. Switching from a pre-law path to sexual education, Haffner quit her job and took a position at the Population Institute. She urged students to take their first job based on the organization itself, not on the position originally offered to them. “At the Population Institute… I would come in early and stay late… I started creating fact sheets for them, and I started to do extra research. I would put memos on their desk of interesting things I thought they needed to know when they came in in the morning.” She was promoted at the Public Health Service, after being the only employee still in the office after 5 p.m. At 23 years old, Haffner was given a $14,000,000 national program to set up adolescent health centers around the country. Once Haffner became the Executive Director of SEICUS, she organized health and sexuality organizations around the country in the production of the “Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education,” which are still widely used today. Haffner is also the author of seven books; her first one, “From Diapers to Dating,” continues to be the most successful. She commented on the importance of collaboration in any field. “We are smarter together than we are alone,” Haffner said. “No matter how good you are, how smart you are, how passionate you are, you don’t know everything, and other people can help you think. That’s really been a lesson that I’ve learned over and over again.” Haffner then described the most recent “turn” her life has taken, which began during a talk she was asked to give at her home congregation on sexuality and religion. “In the middle of that talk, I felt a call… this message of ‘this is what you’re supposed to do,’” said Haffner. “I’m from a Jewish background and am a Unitarian Universalist—we don’t get calls from anybody… this was not part of my experience at all.” She pointed to a quote from Frederick Buechner, a Presbyterian minister, to describe her understanding of “call” as the place “where the world’s greatest need meets your greatest joy.” “I’ve often thought, ‘Why didn’t I go into gun control?’ ‘Why didn’t I go into anti-racism?’” Haffner said. “Frankly, I’m always amazed that sexuality issues are the front page issues of political life… as important as I think those things are, I don’t think they’re the most important issues facing America, [but] they’re my issues. When I heard this line, I thought, ‘That’s what it is,’ finding that intersection between what I’m passionate about and what the world needs.” She concluded with some lessons for not-for-profit management, emphasizing the importance of maintaining relationships and asking for help when it’s needed. She also cited proficiency in finances as one of her most important skills, specifically the ability to read an audit or put a budget together. In terms of hiring, she advised students never to offer a position to someone they couldn’t imagine seeing every day. “One of the things I do often now, is take people out for meals before I hire them, and watch how they treat the wait staff,” Haffner said. “If I don’t like the way you treat the wait staff, I don’t want you working for me, because eventually you’re going to treat one of our customers like that, or one of our stakeholders, or me, like that.” Haffner referred back to her belief in working beyond the parameters of the traditional workday. “I have always worked harder than anyone who’s worked for me,” Haffner said. “I am always the first person in the office, and I’m still the last person to leave. I’ve been doing that now for close to 40 years. In order to get the best from people, I think that they need to see that I am full in.” Finally, she expressed the belief in staying involved programmatically, doing direct community outreach, and staying current. Haffner noted that after leaving SEICUS, she assumed she was finished having adventures, but that she realized life is constantly evolving. She described some of her most exciting moments since ministry, including marrying her two close friends after their 50-year relationship when gay marriage finally became legal in New York. “I’ve been to the Easter Prayer Breakfast at the White House,” said Haffner. “I’ve debated Bill O’Reilly several times on television, I did the blessing at Jane Fonda’s 70th birthday—that’s Rosie O’Donnell behind her, and Sally Field, and Lily Tomlin, and me—I got to hang out with these people. This picture is from a transgender day of remembrance… I was invited by the Peace Council to come to a meeting in Thailand with them, to talk about women and religion.” Civic Engagement Fellow Rosy Capron ’14 reacted to Haffner’s talk as an alumna. “It’s helpful to hear from someone who clearly enjoys the work that they do, and who has not only had a satisfying career, but also a really satisfying life,” Capron said. “Not necessarily an easy career or an easy life, but [she’s] always learning and reflecting.” Joanna Paul ’18 reflected on a more personal level. “I’m a Unitarian Universalist [UU] myself, so it was really cool for me to hear a fellow UU who actually went here, because I’m really interested in social justice,” Paul said. “Everything she said really speaks to me. I think the issues she focused on are really important. I liked the point about taking people out to dinner before hiring them… I thought that was really interesting.” Haffner’s final remarks were a testament to her experience at the University. “I’m grateful to Wesleyan for what it gave me and what I learned here,” Haffner said. “It was that girl with the speculum that’s still teaching pretty much the same thing, which is that our sexuality is a wonderful part of life, that we need education and information, and that we can bring our passion to make our world a better place for people.”"
"The Argus Welcomes New Tenure-Track Faculty","2015-09-07","by Jenny Davis, Features Editor","New tenure-track faculty dish on their journeys to Wes, the projects that excite them, and what they do when they're not teaching.This fall, the University welcomed a broad array of new tenure-track faculty members. The Argus discussed with these professors the paths that took them to Wesleyan, their current projects, and their lives outside the classroom.   Francesco Marco Aresu, Assistant Professor of Italian The Argus: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? Marco Aresu: I work on medieval and early-modern literature: Influential personalities in my field very rarely make it to the news. I prefer to mention “heroes” at the intersection between academia and civil society. Next year is the anniversary of the 1966 flood of the Arno in Florence. Volunteers from around the world (the so-called Mud Angels) convened to Florence to clean the city from the mud, to retrieve books and work of arts from flooded rooms, and to rescue the traces of the past for the spiritual growth of future generations. Very peculiar heroes, indeed.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? MA: With a former colleague from Harvard University I am working on a recently re-discovered manuscript of Leon Battista Alberti, an Italian humanist of the 15th century. I am also working on my first book, which studies how different media (manuscripts, prints, kindle, etc.) affect the composition, circulation, and reception of the literary texts that they transmit.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Any special talents or hobbies? MA: I like to learn languages (I am in the process of picking the ninth language I will study). I work out every day. And I love me some good red wine. Not necessarily in this order.   Joseph Coolon, Assistant Professor of Biology The Argus: What’s the most important thing for you about working with students? Joseph Coolon: I really enjoy seeing the moment when things click for people. One of the things that’s really important to me is reaching students who may have never considered the subject that I’m teaching something that they might care about, or need to know, or be interested in.   A: What’s one project or idea that you’re really excited about? JC: The research in my lab is generally focused on looking at how the DNA that different species contain allows different species to be different. Specifically, the work is looking at how changes in DNA influence these differences between species, not in terms of what products are being made by those genes, but by how those genes are turned on and turned off, and when, where, and how much of them are being made.   A: What do you enjoy outside the classroom? JC: I quite enjoy running. I quite enjoy fishing. I like bike riding as well. So I guess a lot of more active outdoor sports.   Candice Etson, Assistant Professor of Physics The Argus: What’s the most crucial part of teaching for you? Candice Eston: There have been people who have taken time out of their lives to do something small that really made a big difference to me. It’s really critical in fields like science, where there are so many different paths, and it’s not always clear how you get from one place to another, that people take the time to tell you what your opportunities are. People really did that for me, and it made me want to give that back. And then in my own field, there are not a lot women or minorities, so I feel really lucky to have had the opportunities I had. I’d really like to be a part of letting those opportunities be available to more people….When you have people with different perspectives, who come from different places and different backgrounds, everything is better. It’s so much more interesting, you get such better work done, and amazing things can happen. I also just love teaching. I think the stuff I do is really cool, so I like to let other people know about that.   A: What is one research project or idea that you’re really excited about right now? CE: I’m really excited about a project that I’m just now getting going. There are two major projects I’m working on. One is in the lab, and then I have this education research project I’m doing, which I’m actually not going to tell you too much about, because Wesleyan students are going to be the research subjects. I’m really excited to be doing science education research to try to find out how the way people think and do problem-solving is important for science education, and the goal of that is to make the way we teach physics better. I’m excited about that. Everyone at Wesleyan is really into it, and that’s been great.   A: You were a ballet dancer and you’re an artist. What connections have you found between science and art? CE: In ballet, there’s this sort of approach, like a mindset, that you never really feel that anything you do is finished or perfect, so you just keep working on it. When you learn to be a ballet dancer, the first things you learn are pliés and tendus, and until the day you stop doing ballet, you will do pliés and tendus, and you will always try to make them better. And so that kind of approach, and that mindset, and that discipline, has always served me really well—that idea that you can always find something new, even in something really simple that you learned as a kid.   Anthony Hatch, Assistant Professor of Science in Society  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan?  Anthony Hatch: Wesleyan’s intellectual culture and commitment to liberal education as reflected in its faculty and students were the biggest draws for me. I am especially excited about being a member of the truly interdisciplinary Science in Society Program. There are very few programs like it in the country that draw on so many diverse fields of inquiry.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching?  AH: I love the ways in which teaching is a special kind of performance art. I very much consider my time with my students in the classroom as an intimate and personal show. Like the best artists, I aim to bring high energy and serious preparation to every single class and hope that illumination and new understandings emerge for myself and my students.   A: What’s one project or idea you’re excited about right now?  AH: I’m most excited about my new book titled “Blood Sugar: Racial Pharmacology and Food Justice in Black America” that will be published this winter with the University of Minnesota Press. In this book, I analyze and challenge the ways in which “metabolic syndrome” has emerged as a major biomedical category that medical researchers have created to better understand the health risks of high blood sugar, blood pressure, body fat, and cholesterol. I argue that the metabolic syndrome also represents another, very real crisis: Its advent signals a new form of “colorblind scientific racism” that repackages race within biomedical and genomic research.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Talents or hobbies?  AH: I most enjoy traveling, reading, and laughing with my sweet family. I also enjoy early morning jogging—something I never thought I would say! At one point in a past life, I could make a fair claim to be a triple threat in the performing arts: I could dance, sing, and play a musical instrument (the violin). I’m way too rusty to call them “talents” or “hobbies” but I could probably complete a decent grande jete if you put me on the spot.   Jeffrey Naecker, Assistant Professor of Economics  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Jeff Naecker: The entire Economics Department at Wesleyan is incredibly impressive: producing well-published research while also teaching rigorous classes to extremely intellectual students. I’m honored to have a chance to work with everyone here. Wesleyan also reminds me a lot of my undergraduate time at Berkeley: smart, athletic, and socially engaged students on a purposefully inclusive and active campus.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? JN: Teaching is one of the most value-creating things we can do as human beings. It involves organizing a potentially very large set of knowledge into a form that students can digest, re-interpret, and ultimately pass on to others. That creation and transmission of information is exhilarating and rewarding.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? JN: Here’s a little mental experiment: Suppose I give you $10 and tell you that you can split it however you choose between two poor households in Kenya that I’ve identified. After you tell me how you’d like to allocate the money, I’ll flip a coin. If it’s heads, I’ll allocate as you asked. But if it’s tails, I’ll allocate  differently: all $10 to household A and none to household B.  So, how would you like to split the money? Here’s the twist: Suppose that I’ve flipped the coin and I double-check your allocation with you before implementing it.  Do you want to change your allocation? In a paper I’m writing right now with several co-authors, we show in a series of experiments that many people choose $0 to A and $10 to B initially — they are offsetting the default allocation.  But after the coin flip, they want to switch to to an equal split: $5 each.  It turns out this behavior is hard to explain with standard economic theories. Put another way, we as economists are still learning about how people define fairness, and how the definition depends on the context and the timing of the decision.   Paula Park, Assistant Professor of Spanish  The Argus: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? Paula Park: Basing this question on my current research, I would say that four major heroes in my field are José Rizal, José Martí, Eugenio María de Hostos and Lola Rodríguez de Tió. They were all compromised intellectuals and proponents of the independence of their homelands (Philippines, Cuba and Puerto Rico), as well as active seekers of transnational unity against colonial powers.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? PP: When I look back at the courses I have taught in the past years in three universities, stories of all kinds come to mind. But ultimately the most rewarding memory is simple and yet abstract: having provided students with the opportunity to confront something new. My goal in the classroom is to enable students to discover new interests of their own through the study of Spanish language and Hispanic culture. Also, for me, human interaction is at the core of teaching and learning, so I really enjoy seeing my students collaborating with each other for assignments in class or even outside of class.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? PP: Right now am excited about two projects. On the one hand I look forward to being able to work on my first book project, which examines the influences of writers from Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines after 1898, that is, right after they ceased to be connected through the logic of the Spanish empire and became subject to US expansionism. On the other hand, I am also excited about a more personal academic project. Born to Korean immigrants in Chile, I am interested in the cultural productions of diverse Asian diasporas throughout Latin America and the Hispanic Caribbean. I will offer a course that will cover this topic in the spring semester.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Any special talents or hobbies? PP: I like hiking or simply walking around cities, especially if it’s in good company. Since I’ve moved to Connecticut, I’ve enjoyed exploring Hartford. At home, I’m enjoying playing the piano again.   Michelle Personick, Assistant Professor of Chemistry The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Michelle Personick: I’ve known that I wanted to teach at a small liberal arts college as long as I’ve known I wanted to be a professor. I went to a NESCAC school (Middlebury) myself as an undergrad and I think the small liberal arts college is a fantastic model for undergraduate education because it provides opportunities for faculty and students to actually get to know each other and for faculty to be able to take an active interest in students’ success. As a graduate student at a research university, I was responsible for a lecture with 350 students, and at that point it’s hard to reach out to individual students who might be struggling, unless they take the initiative and come to office hours. Wesleyan was a particularly special opportunity for me as a scientist because of the strong research programs here at Wes. Having a small, but talented, group of graduate students in chemistry increases the quality and variety of scientific resources available to all students on campus, and means that I’m able to introduce undergrads to my area of research—metal nanomaterials—which is something I wouldn’t be able to do at a lot of other liberal arts schools.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? MP: My biggest influences have generally been the people who have directly mentored me: a graduate student a year ahead of me in grad school, as well as my undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral advisors. It may not seem as exciting as the big “heroes” of the field, but those were the people I saw every day, doing science and being leaders in their areas. Those are the people you watch and think, “How do they do that?”—whether they’re conducting experiments, or coming up with ideas, or giving presentations. And then a younger scientist comes up to you sometime later and says the same thing to you, and you realize those people have been teaching you how all along.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? MP: One big exciting project for me right now is setting up my research lab and starting to do experiments. I have a brand new space that I’ve been stocking with shiny new glassware and supplies over the summer with help from a couple of research students. The lab has begun to be operational in the last few weeks and we’ve done some initial experiments, which is great. This fall we’ll be building a new piece of equipment and we’ll have some new students joining the research group so I’m excited to see where things are a few months from now.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom or lab? Any special talents or hobbies? MP: Before I came to Wesleyan, I was living in the Boston area and I trained and competed with a masters women’s rowing team. I loved being on the Charles River early in the morning and enjoyed getting to know a lot of awesome women who came from a wide range of backgrounds. I miss it, and I’m hoping to get out on the Connecticut River in the not-too-distant future.   Felipe Ramírez, Assistant Professor of Math  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Felipe Ramírez: It’s a great university and math department. Also, I like that both research and teaching are emphasized equally here. At many other places the faculty are expected to concentrate on one more than the other. But research and teaching are both important aspects of my life, and I wouldn’t want to give either one up in favor of the other.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? FR: I truly enjoy meeting my students, interacting with them, etc. But my answer for this one was a bit more selfish: By teaching, I improve my own understanding of the material. Students often ask questions that I’ve never considered before, and this forces me to think about old ideas in new ways. I enjoy the challenge of seeking explanations from these new points-of-view, and the feeling of discovery when I find them. Also, it is very common for some random piece of a course to make it’s way into my research, often when the two seem totally unrelated. Sometimes I’ll be stuck on something for days, only to discover a solution waiting for me in my own lecture notes.   A: What’s a project you’re excited about right now? FR: Lately (meaning the last couple of years) I’ve been interested in a field of mathematics called Diophantine approximation, where we try to quantify how closely irrational numbers (non-fractions) can be approximated by rational numbers (fractions). As simple as it sounds, there are still many open, profound, beautiful problems in this area, and even some that have potential “real-world” applications. Even better, there are many deep connections between Diophantine approximation and my main line of research: ergodic theory and dynamical systems, where we study the long-term behavior of systems that change in time. I find these problems and their connections to dynamics fascinating.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? FR: I have always loved music. I taught guitar throughout my undergraduate years, and nowadays I play mostly for my daughter, who is one year old and doesn’t let me get through two bars before she’s swatting and banging at the strings. I also love puzzles, especially crosswords. I rarely skip a day. (NYT almost exclusively, though I did take up the Guardian’s cryptics during the five years I lived in England.) I also read, watch movies, etc. Mostly, though, my free time is spent with my wife and daughter. We’re new to Connecticut, so we have a lot to discover!   Ying Jia Tan, Assistant Professor of History  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? YJT: I have always wanted to teach at a liberal arts college with a vibrant and diverse student population, which allows me to develop as a scholar and teacher. There are many programs for civic engagement with local communities and the broader region, which allows the students to see the connection between what they learn in the classroom and the world around them.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? YJT: I certainly refrain from worshipping heroes in my academic field. As a historian of science, I believe that the pursuit of knowledge is not the result of the work of a single genius, but the collective endeavor of all levels of society. Take the light bulb for example. It is too simplistic to say that it was invented by Thomas Edison. Rather, the development of manufacturing systems, the financing that supported the growth of power-generation and delivery systems, and growing perception of the safety of electric light all contributed to the popularization of the light bulb. As a scholar of Chinese history, I am deeply motivated by the educational philosophy of a twelfth-century Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi (1130-1200). Many of his conversations with his students revolve around the meaning of education. He advocated the idea of “Greater Learning,” through which students should be instructed in the extension of knowledge, understand the principles of nature, and learn the basic values of loyalty and filial piety.   A: What’s one project that you’re excited about right now? YJT: I am excited about my book project about the history of electricity in wartime China. My work looks at the East Asian energy crisis, which started with the outbreak of the second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and never really ended. I examine how the Guomindang and Communist regimes dealt with power shortages. The formative years of China’s energy industry overlapped with the years of war, which forced the Guomindang and the Communists to integrate the energy sector with national security interest. This project allows us to understand what the term “energy security” means in China today.   Shellae Versey, Assistant Professor of Psychology    The Argus: Who are some of your heroes or major influences in your field? Shellae Versey: That’s a difficult one! It’s hard to narrow it down, because there are so many people I admire, who are pushing the traditional boundaries of psychology in order to move the field forward. But I think if I had to name heroes, I’d say Kenneth and Mamie Clark’s work initially drew me to study psychology, initially as a graduate student, because their work still impacts social psychology and other fields as well. And then I’m also deeply influenced by the work of Patricia Hill-Collins, Kimberle’ Crenshaw, and bell hooks, who engage in difficult dialogues around issues of gender, race, identity, and engagement in a purposeful way.   A: What’s your favorite thing about working with students? SV: I actually get really excited working with students. I think that, especially in a small, seminar-style class, you get the opportunity to interact with and get to know students, how they’re thinking and processing the material. I often get asked very real and practical, useful questions, either about the content that we’re covering or about my own research, that I’ve not considered before or thought about through a particular lens. It’s refreshing to have that experience in the classroom, where everyone feels that they’re fulfilled and part of the learning experience, myself included.   A: What is one project or idea that you’re really excited about right now? SV: A new project I’m excited about starting is exploring neighborhood social engagement among different age groups. One of the areas I study is aging. I’m always interested in the question of how older adults remain socially engaged as they get older, and what factors facilitate either engagement or withdrawal and isolation, and ultimately [I hope to] have a sense of how being socially engaged—or lack thereof—correlates with mental health.   A: What do you enjoy outside the classroom? What are your passions, talents, or hobbies? SV: I don’t have any special talents! But I do enjoy reading for leisure, which is harder than I thought it would be—just to pick up a book and read it. So when I get time I like to read, I like to exercise, and I like to scrapbook and do photography, which might be a little different. I enjoy anything in general that’s off the beaten path. I like to be outdoors and just enjoy life. I’m trying to live in the moment and embrace the spirit of mindfulness, which I think as a society we’re engaging in as a collective conversation.   Yamil Velez, Assistant Professor of Government  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Yamil Velez: Wesleyan has always stood out in my mind as a university that encourages activism and student engagement. As an instructor, there is nothing better than having a classroom full of thoughtful and interested students.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? YV: Ryan Enos, Dan Hopkins, and Ben Newman are some of my major influences. They’ve caused me to think about my research in a new way and are excellent people to boot.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? YV: One of the most satisfying aspects of teaching is watching students come in with very little background knowledge and leave with a deep understanding of the material. I love when students push back against the literature and craft their own arguments about the material.   A: What’s one project or idea you’re excited about right now? YV: I have a project examining the effects of residential mobility options on the desire for local residents to either fight or flee immigration. Given recent rhetoric on the topic and demographic trends in the U.S., I think understanding how citizens respond to immigrants is of importance. We need to do a better job of encouraging cooperation between native-born residents and immigrants.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Do you have any special talents or hobbies? YV: Music has always been a huge part of my life. I’ve been making electronic music since I was about 12 and I’m a classically trained guitarist. If I’m not conducting research or planning lessons, I’m likely playing guitar or messing with Ableton Live. It’s a stubborn passion of mine."
"Princeton Review Ranks University #1 Impact School","2015-09-07","by Natasha Nurjadin, Assistant News Editor","University tops Princeton Review's Best Schools for Making an Impact, with most on-campus student engagement and community service opportunities.The University has been ranked #1 on Princeton Review’s list of “Best Schools for Making an Impact” this year, a new category of college rankings published in the Review’s “Colleges That Pay You Back: The 200 Best Value Colleges and What It Takes to Get In (College Admissions Guides).” According to the Princeton Review, the list of “Best Schools for Making an Impact” are schools that feature the best community service opportunities, student governments, sustainability, and on-campus student engagement. They are also schools with the highest reported percentage of alumni with high job meaning. “Students say that the ‘open and engaging student culture’ is the University’s greatest strength: Students are ‘at the heart of global issues’ thanks to the ‘vibrant student culture and activism,’” the Princeton Review website reads. “The Connecticut school is known for its community service and commitment, headlined by the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship.” The Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship (PCSE) is a campus resource that encourages and supports students and alumni who are interested in social entrepreneurial ventures, including creating and sustaining programs, businesses, and organizations. They hold programs to help develop student programs and also offer grants for students who are interested in developing new programs. Lily Herman ’16 is the founder of The Prospect, a website utilized by high school students to help through the college process. Today, it has around 600,000 users. “It’s awesome that Wesleyan is on the list for being an impact school,” Herman said. “There’s been a lot of work done in recent years by the Center for Community Partnerships, the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and other departments to ensure that students are getting a thoughtful and well-rounded education on what civic engagement is really about.” Makaela Kingsley, director of PCSE, wrote in an email to The Argus that she believes social impact has always been a core component of the University culture and philosophy. “I don’t think [this list] says anything about our community that we didn’t already know,” Kingsley wrote. “I’ve joked that this ranking just means the secret is out, that the world is starting to recognize what we witness every day: students and alumni who are passionate about social change, with an academic and extra-curricular education that uniquely prepares them to have impact.” Kingsley believes that the ranking reflects how passionate the students at the University are about being change-makers tackling social issues. “Today, ‘practical idealism’ continues to characterize a Wesleyan education,” Kingsley wrote. “We attract students, faculty, and staff who think critically, draw important connections between disciplines, and seek ways to contribute to the common good.” With this ranking, Kingsley has high hopes for the development of PCSE and that students take advantage of these resources to continue making an impact. “I hope prospective students choose to come to Wesleyan not just for our academic reputation, but also because we are a premier school for social entrepreneurs and changemakers,” Kingsley wrote. The Patricelli Center will continue to hold and introduce new social impact programs, including the Wesleyan Social Impact Summit, a program that will bring together students and alumni to discuss and share resources on what they are passionate about during the weekend of Nov. 13-14. The event will feature panelists including prominent Wesleyan alumni, small group programs to facilitate discussion, and networking opportunities for students and alumni alike. “A lot of the social impact programs on campus are on the newer side, so I’m really excited to see how those continue to grow and develop in the coming years,” Herman said. Caroline Liu ’18, the intern for the Social Impact Summit, said that the ranking reflects the image of the University of one that promotes social change. “I’m not surprised that Wesleyan is number one [on the list],” Liu said. “But I don’t think it’s a reason to pat ourselves on the back or feel that we’re finished with our work. I think that we received this title because we always had a culture of caring about making change, and it’s not like this title should make us feel that we’ve achieved our goal.”"
"Professor’s Bookshelf: John Finn","2015-10-08","by Jake Lahut, Staff Writer","Government professor John Finn opens up about the Constitution, French cooking, and law school. c/o thegreatcourses.com Professor of Government John Finn, specializing in constitutional law, is the author of several books on constitutional theory and is currently writing a cookbook on omelets. He sat down with The Argus to discuss civic engagement, the inadequacies of American omelets, and how he drove his college to bankruptcy.   The Argus: Why teach at Wesleyan? John Finn: That’s an interesting question and one that I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about over the 25 to 30 years I’ve been here, because for some of my time here, I’ve had the distinct impression that some of my colleagues in the broadest sense of the term really doubt whether there’s an appropriate role for legal education in a liberal arts setting. And I want to be clear that it’s not my department [Government] that feels that way. It’s in the broadest sense. I get asked this question all the time: Why aren’t you teaching at a law school? I get asked by my colleagues. I get asked by my students. I get asked by Wesleyan alumni, by Wesleyan parents. And my answer is one that has really forced me to think about what the role of law is or should be in a liberal arts curriculum. So broadly speaking, I sort of subscribe to a really old fashioned notion that an important part of being a citizen in a liberal democracy is understanding that you have obligations to other people, not simply rights, and I think it’s a critical part of any liberal arts education to understand what citizenship means and to be engaged in citizenship as a real practical everyday kind of activity. My scholarship is centered around that question and I’d like to think my teaching is as well. I really feel comfortable at Wesleyan. I would not want to teach in a law school, which—without criticizing anything—is I think a little bit too pre-professional and narrow-minded for the sorts of things I would like to do.   A: Could you tell us more about your scholarship and how you would explain what you do to someone who may not even be that familiar with the Constitution itself? JF: My scholarship runs along two tracks that probably don’t have that much to do with each other. Most of it is centered around questions of constitutional theory both comparative and domestic. What I’m really interested in is how constitutional orders maintain themselves, how they survive, how they decay over time. I’m interested in other words, as I put it in my most recent book, what does it mean to live a constitutional way of life? So that’s not the study of Supreme Court cases per se, it’s not the study of constitutional provisions per se. It’s more about what it means to call ourselves a constitutional community and what do we need to do to make good on promises made to that community, as well as how we fail to achieve those promises.   A: When you’re not reading really dense legal texts about a document as vague as the Constitution, what do you like to read for pleasure or to simply inform yourself as a citizen? JF: That sort of builds on the last question. My other area of scholarship is food studies, so I spend a lot of time reading and collecting food books of all sorts. Some of them are as simple and straight forward as cookbooks, which I love to collect and read, but a lot of them are as advanced as food and cultural theory. Some of it exists in the margins. The book I read most recently that I got the most pleasure out of was a cookbook from the early 1970s written by Salvador Dali.   A: Salvador Dali wrote cookbooks? JF: Yeah! Well, one, anyway. [Laughs] If you know anything about Salvador Dali, you don’t have to see his name on the cover to know it’s quintessential Salvador Dali. I’m thinking about making a movie where over the course of a year I cook every single one of Dali’s recipes.   A: So, if I’m not mistaken, you’re a trained French chef. Could you tell us more about what it took to get certified? JF: This is something I probably shouldn’t say out loud, but I took one of my sabbaticals and went to culinary school in New York City at the French Culinary Institute. In any event, I’d like to think that the University got some value out of it, because I do teach food courses here from time to time, and I’ve published a fair amount on food-related stuff. So yeah, that was a blast. It was hard to get that degree. I can honestly say, of all of my higher degrees, I had more difficulty getting the culinary degree than any other one.   A: Could you please list your degrees so we could get some context on how difficult this was? JF: Yeah so, B.A. at Nasson College, which went bankrupt shortly after I graduated, maybe because I didn’t pay back my student loans, but I couldn’t have been the only one who did…. Then I got a law degree from Georgetown and a Masters and Ph.D from Princeton, and then the culinary degree. Of all of them, the culinary degree was far and away the most difficult—it’s the only one that was dangerous. I could and did hurt myself, whereas I was fine getting a Ph.D.   A: What does a good meal consist of for you now that you have this degree? JF: I still love to cook classical French and Continental European food. For right now, a good meal is a finely prepared omelet. I’m actually writing a cookbook on omelets, so I spend every weekend trying new recipes for omelets.   A: This might not make any difference, but I have a friend who’s really interested in the two different styles of omelet cooking, French and American. What’s the difference between the two? JF: One is classic and one is a cheap knockoff. [Laughs] No I don’t really mean that. The French omelet is softer, it shouldn’t have any color, and it’s runnier, whereas an American omelet is cooked more fully, it’s drier, and it’s pretty simple. You just fold the damn thing in half. My book has four master styles for the four kinds of omelets.   A: What advice would you give to a Wesleyan student considering going to law school? JF: First, I would say go into it eyes-open because even though some people think the market has rebounded—if it has at all—it’s a slow process, so it’s not like a law degree is like the Willy Wonka golden ticket to happiness. It’s a tough go, and there’s a reason why every survey on happiness puts lawyers at the very bottom of the list. But that said, the most important thing I would tell anyone thinking about going to law school is to major in whatever you want to major in. There’s no reason at all to think that you have to major in Government or one of the social sciences. I haven’t done this in a while and I’m glad you reminded me of it. When people come to me and say, “Should I go to law school?” I would give them a letter that Felix Frankfurter wrote to a 12-year-old boy that said, “Study whatever you want; learn to love learning.” There is no particular approach that’s going to make you better off or more prepared. I haven’t had the most successful life, but I ended up here without taking any law as an undergraduate. This interview was edited for length."
"Kim ’02 Leads Crowdfunding Bootcamp","2015-10-22","by Molly Schiff, News Editor","Hyungsoo Kim ’02 returned to campus to share his experiences launching a successful Kickstarter Campaign. Molly Schiff, News Editor With the rise of crowdfunding websites such as KickStarter and Indiegogo, it may seem easier than ever to start a new enterprise. However, this is not the case; launching a successful crowdfunding campaign requires careful consideration and a lot of strategy. Hyungsoo Kim ’02, entrepreneur and creator of the Bradley Timepiece, returned to campus on Thursday, Oct. 22 to share the dos and don’ts of successful online fundraising. As part of the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship’s (PCSE) Fall Workshop series, Kim discussed the steps required to create, market, and effectively crowdfund a new product. He began by addressing how the advent of crowdfunding sites has transformed how entrepreneurs can raise funds for the initial phases of their product or services without having to give up too much of their company to investors or rely on family members. “Even three years ago, there was no such thing [as a crowdfunding website],” Kim said.  “You would have a really great idea, but no way of raising money, so there was no way to start anything if you didn’t have money, or your parents or family didn’t have money. So, the crowdfunding campaign had a huge impact on a lot of startup companies as well as people who run social campaigns.” As opposed to the traditional investment model, where one develops a product with financing from investors—to whom one generally gives a large stake of their companies in exchange—the crowdfunding process maintains the entrepreneur’s independence by reversing the process by which a product or service comes into existence. “Now, [when] you have the prototype, and then you post it on Kickstarter, and then all of the marketing…is free, basically,” Kim said. “Five percent of the money you raise, you pay to Kickstarter, but it’s not that much. And, if you don’t make any money, you don’t pay.” Kim then used his own product as a model, detailing the way in which he successfully crowdsourced the initial phases producing the Bradley Timepiece, a watch that allows wearers to tell the time through the senses of sight and touch. The project was inspired the discontent expressed by one of his classmates at the MIT Sloan School of Management where he earned his MBA, who was blind and could not find a watch that was both stylish and functional. Though talking watches and watches with open faces were available, the former was disruptive and the latter rather useless, as the hands would easily be shifted. “I was really surprised that there was nothing else,” he said. “There should be something else.” So, with a team of engineers and designers, Kim created the Bradley Timepiece and embarked on the process of marketing, crowdfunding, and selling it. He stressed the importance of generating buzz around a product before launching a Kickstarter campaign, as the first few days that it is can make or break its success. Kim and his team did this by making a video as well as social media pages. Generally, Kim noted that the most effective advertisements for mainstream products were those focused on the design of a product and were generally about a minute and a half long. However, his video, featuring the story of Brad Snyder, veteran and Paralympic champion who lost his sight while on active duty in Afghanistan clocks in at about six minutes. Katya Sapozhnina ’16, founder and president of the Wesleyan Entrepreneurship Society, asked Kim about his risky decision to create such a long video that advertised the product from a personal angle. “I wanted to ask about the video and why you chose to focus on the personal story of someone who is blind versus the cool design aspects,” Sapozhnina said. Kim responded that he took such a risk because he felt the story was compelling (so much so that he named the watch after Snyder) and would achieve one of Snyder’s goals of bridging the gap between the blind and the sighted. “We wanted to connect people, those who are visually impaired and those who are sighted,” Kim said. “We wanted to break down the wall between them.” Additionally, Kim reached out to many bloggers in order to begin circulating information about the product and impending Kickstarter campaign. In total, he got media attention from about a dozen different sources prior to the page’s launching. All of this preparation work led to a strong start, which put him on the front page of the website for four days. That exposure, gained either by popularity or staff picks, is what can make or break a project’s crowdfunding campaign. He also made note of the modest goal he posted on the site : $40 thousand. “Our internal goal was $80 thousand,” Kim said. “But we put $40 thousand because if you don’t reach your goal, you don’t get any [of the donated funds].” Employing these strategies, Kim was able to raise approximately $500 thousand in the 30-day period during which the page was live. Sapozhnina found the presentation informative and encouraging. “I think crowdfunding is wonderful because it makes being an entrepreneur more accessible,” she said. “We can now use very little money while raising thousands, even before making the product.” Jennifer Roach ’14, Civic Engagement Fellow for the Center of Community Partnerships, noted the universality and applicability of Kim’s work to students’ work at the University and beyond. “Whatever project they end up doing, whatever organizations or business they end up starting, crowdfunding is one of those tools that might be useful to a lot of students working on any number of projects,” said Roach. “It’s applicable if you’re doing nonprofit work, if you’re at an educational institution…it can even be used for a political campaign. It’s very cool to be able to have [the opportunity], any time that you get a chance to learn from someone who has started their own business, who has done something that you’re interested in after graduation, whether or not you’re interested in crowdfunding.” For all students, there is a lesson to be learned from someone who has been there before. “You never know what you’re going to get out of one of these workshops,” Roach said."
"WSA Approves Legislative Pathway for Student Petitions","2015-11-12","by Molly Schiff, News Editor","Resolution 4.37, passed at the Nov. 7 Senate Meeting, aims to increase transparency and participation in the WSA's legislative process. In an effort to improve its representation of the student body, the Wesleyan Student Assembly Senate passed new legislation on Sunday, Nov. 8 that will enhance students’ abilities to directly influence the legislation that make it onto each meeting’s agenda. Resolution 4.37 will set up new protocol for students to introduce resolutions directly to the Senate. It passed by a measure of 23-0, with four votes abstaining. Previously, students interested in introducing legislation—such as petitions that have gained popular support through signatures—had to find an elected WSA member to sponsor the bill and present it on their behalves. The resolution acknowledges this situation, amending section 5.05 of its bylaws to provide a mechanism by which these students can directly submit their proposals to the WSA. WSA Senate member Jacob Maiman-Stadtmauer ’19 introduced the resolution as a way to provide a pathway for the often-confusing process. He feels that this will provide a measure of transparency to the WSA’s legislative processes. “Personally, I’m really excited about this resolution because it makes the WSA more transparent and democratic,” Maiman-Stadmauer wrote in an email to The Argus. “Through crystallizing and publishing the process for the WSA responding to resolutions we’ve been able to make the Assembly that much more transparent. Additionally, through allowing the larger student body to directly propose solutions to problems or bring new problems to light through resolutions, we’ve been able to make the WSA more democratic.” Student-introduced resolutions must meet a set of eligibility requirements in order to be considered. First, all pieces of proposed legislation must be formatted in the same way as all Senate member-introduced resolutions. Students who have trouble meeting this requirement are encouraged to meet with the Chief of Staff in order to ensure their proposal is properly written. Current Chief of Staff John Henry Vansant ’18 elaborated on the role he will play in drafting legislation. “As the Resolution specifies, my role as the Chief of Staff will be to facilitate this effort by assisting ‘the author/s of the proposal to change it into appropriate form,’” Vansant wrote in an email to The Argus. “Since the WSA votes on resolutions, petitions need to be translated into resolution form. The Chief of Staff’s role is then to alleviate this burden of having to format a petition by helping students out with the editing. The WSA recognizes that procedures should not inhibit student voices from being heard, so my role as Chief of Staff is to make sure that petitions will be introduced and discussed without any setbacks.” Second, each resolution must obtain a minimum number of student signatures, determined by voter turnout and subject to change from year to year. “[The] number of signatures required will be set equal to the number of votes that the elected Wesleyan Student Assembly member who was elected with the least number of votes garnered,” Resolution 4.37 reads. While this process may appear overly intricate, Maiman-Stadmauer explained that this particular requirement was determined in the interest of democracy. “This formula may seem complicated, but we felt that if a student could be given the full privileges of any senator with a given number of votes, there’s no reason that students shouldn’t be able to introduce resolutions with a number of supporters equal to that,” he wrote. Students whose proposals meet the standards outlined by the document will also be responsible for presenting their resolutions to members of the WSA. This increased level of direct student non-member participation in the WSA legislative process was instituted with the overall goals of the WSA in mind. “Through allowing the larger student body to directly propose solutions to problems or bring new problems to light through resolutions, we’ve been able to make the WSA more democratic,” wrote Maidman-Stadmauer. “This resolution will also make the WSA more democratic by allowing the larger student body to have a direct and formal say in the WSA through more than just the [biannual] elections. This resolution builds on the recent steps in the last year or so towards becoming more democratic, transparent, and responsive to the student body.” WSA President Kate Cullen ’16 looks forward to seeing the positive impact this resolution intends have on the University. “I commend Jacob for bringing this resolution forward and pushing all of us on the WSA to think more critically about our commitment to transparency, accountability, and greater civic engagement,” said Cullen in an email to The Argus. “This new resolution well exemplifies those values and I am excited to see what opportunities it will bring for open discourse.”"
"The Wesleyan Condition: Endless Intellectual Curiosity","2016-04-11","by Jake Lahut, Opinion Editor","The Wesleyan Condition is an endless curiosity that can never go far enough. No matter what academic category our curiosities may fall under, we find ways to make them relevant to many others. This never-ending intersectional curiosity leads us to question the very underpinnings of almost everything, including our own time. This is why Wesleyan is called a “radical” school, because we are radical in the truest sense. We question the very underpinnings of everything, often to the annoyance of our friends and family back home. This questioning can and should lead us to be quite uncomfortable with many aspects of modernity. Although we do not all share the same tactics in our efforts to make the world a better place, some form of civic engagement is what unites Wesleyan students in their collective, intellectual endeavor while they study in Middletown. There are certainly students at the University who consider themselves apolitical, but there is really no such thing as being apolitical, both in the “real world” and at the University. We are all connected, and we all have opinions and beliefs that affect how we act, whether we know it or not. For most people, Wesleyan is a hyper-liberal atmosphere where it feels like the far left is never far enough. This leads many students to conclude over their time here that they “became more conservative,” or discovered what they “really believe.” Conversely, we all know someone who has become substantially more radical in their beliefs over the course of their time at the University. I would argue that these phenomena stem from the same root: a confrontation with progressive thought that can be so new, foreign, and even scary that it profoundly changes us, whether immediately or over time, whether for better or worse. I would like to believe that people changing at a progressive school is a good thing, especially because I truly believe that this stems from genuine intellectual curiosity. However, we are also producing a new form of intolerance at Wesleyan that I hope will be merely a flash in the pan rather than the beginning of a new trend in the twenty-first century. As many prospective students like we once were descend upon campus for WesFest, we are reminded of our own hopes and preconceived notions of the University, and one of the most common ones is that it is an incredibly tolerant place. Although inclusion is part of the ethos of this school—as can be seen with our gender neutral bathrooms, African American Studies program, experimental artwork, and speech code—all of these cases are at the very least the partial result of grassroots student activism that worked to improve the status quo that was at one point, and in some ways still is, intolerant. The Is This Why movement is the latest form of a long line of racial justice campaigns on this campus that go back to the very origins of the American Civil Rights Movement, where even Wesleyan professors went down South to join the Freedom Riders. Wesleyan is still a school with a majority of white students, and there seems to be a large disparity between who appears on the University home page and who is valued as a member of the community. Another important aspect of tolerance to address is that of dissenting opinion at one of the most progressive schools in the country. While we should never tolerate hate speech, we must allow room for dissent in our political discourse on campus. In fact, we should encourage dissent so that our views can be stronger. Yet in practice, the tendency of students trying to “out-left” each other when weighing in on topics on social media or even in the classroom can lead students who haven’t made up their minds or who have a different opinion to remain in silence. This is not the kind of civic engagement we should be producing at a school of this quality. Of course there are historical narratives that are important to keep in mind regarding more conservative opinions that are more predominant in the United States, such as white-supremacy, male-supremacy, heteronormativity, and the countless others that we ought to learn more about while we are here. This is not, however, an excuse to shelter oneself from dissenting opinion during one’s time at the University. Many students already cannot shelter themselves from societal forces that are supposed to be absent at Wesleyan, such as being asked to present one’s student ID as a student of color when using University transportation, or being asked where one is “really from” as a student of color. Although Wesleyan is a bubble to a large extent, it is never separated from the world or the U.S. in its problems. This unease with what is and what ought to be, with the past and present, with off-campus and on-campus, is what drives the intellectual curiosity that makes our school so great. Our campus debates do not always have two sides, with sometimes three, four, or more viewpoints being represented on issues ranging from Israeli-Palestinian relations to cultural appropriation in program housing. As our vocabularies grow with words that will be unrecognizable to our friends and family at Thanksgiving dinner, we also grow as people during our time here thanks to the deep reservoirs of emotion and knowledge within each of member of the Wesleyan community. While I’m not promising a complete identity crisis or makeover to come with one’s degree from the University, I do believe that the coupling of this school’s culture with its intellectual rigor will drive you to always want to learn more, and to hopefully never settle for what is, choosing instead to question the underpinnings of whatever is in front of you, and to put the pieces back together in a better way as you move forward. So the next time you walk by the names and faces of our alumni, whether in the athletic center or in your department’s senior theses, take a moment to engage with their legacy to remind yourself that they never stopped questioning, and neither should you.

"A Dead Electorate: The Case for an American Monarchy","2016-04-18","by Matthew Finkel, Contributing Writer","When Benjamin Franklin left Independence Hall after the Second Drafting, he was approached by a woman on the street. The woman said, “Mr. Franklin, what manner of government have you bequeathed us?” And Franklin replied, “A republic, madam, if you can keep it.” The Founding Fathers viewed democracy as something to be earned and then vigorously defended. Election by the masses, a daring gambit at the time, could only be pulled off with the backing of a politically engaged, educated, and responsible electorate. The system would only work if all citizens performed their civic duties to the fullest, schooling themselves on the most pressing issues facing the union and casting an informed vote accordingly. These vaunted ideals and lofty goals make it all the more painful to admit that Americans have forfeited their right to Benjamin Franklin’s republic. The Great Experiment has failed. The American public today is a far cry from the model electorate envisioned by the Framers, as evidenced by the country’s massive civic literacy crisis. Americans are woefully unequipped to make the kinds of nuanced voting decisions that a modern democracy demands. Whether and to what extent this failure is attributable to poor education and general political apathy is difficult to pin down, but the statistics behind flagging civic literacy are as compelling as they are disturbing. According to the Associated Press, only one in four Americans can name a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. Most Americans believe their taxes are rising when they are actually falling, are unable to name the current vice president, and can’t clearly differentiate between most presidential candidates. The gap between what voters know and what they need to know will only widen as the workings of the government become more complex and civic education flatlines. If Americans can’t be bothered to learn even the most rudimentary facts about the federal budget, how can they be expected to make sound fiscal decisions? If they can’t find Afghanistan on a map, much less explain why the country waged a war there, how can the voting public possibly navigate an issue as complex as a rising China or a nuclear treaty? The unfortunate answer is that they probably can’t. In the latest ISI citizenship report, 51 percent of the country couldn’t pass the basic civic literacy examination required of incoming citizens. Not only are Americans not qualified to be voters, but apparently most of them aren’t even qualified to be Americans. America’s failings as a democracy don’t end there because in addition to being shockingly uninformed, the average citizen doesn’t even show up to vote. Attendance for House and Senate elections is appalling, with voter turnout for congressional races at its lowest point since 1942. The trend toward lethargy in national elections is just as pronounced. In the 1880 presidential election between James Garfield and Winfield Hancock, voter turnout was nearly 80 percent, and the single biggest issue in that race was the partial demonetization of silver. The most recent presidential election centered around some of the most pressing and vital political issues the country has faced in recent history: rallying after a recession, the budget deficit, a potentially nuclear Iran, the Affordable Care Act, and two full-scale land wars. Voter turnout barely broke 50 percent and the youth turnout was about 10 points lower. Demonetizing silver not being much of a bodice-ripper when compared to the threat of a nuclear winter, American voter engagement seems to have slumped somewhat since its heyday. Voters are completely disengaged from the political process and have abdicated their responsibility as citizens in a democracy. Statistics suggest that Americans don’t know the first thing about the country they live in or the policies they support, yet they are entrusted with electing the most important governing body in the world. In a decade of historic importance, turnout is at an equally historic low. Fear, ignorance, and misinformation dominate a political arena bereft of reason and intellect because the voting public can’t be trusted to read up on the issues or cast a ballot. A return to the monarchy probably isn’t in the cards, but when faced with an electorate that could seemingly only be drawn to the voting booth in the event of an alien invasion, leadership by heredity doesn’t seem like such an awful alternative.

"Students Look to Vote Amid Low Turnout","2016-10-03","by Ariel Adler, Contributing Writer","In less than 40 days, Americans will elect the next President of the United States. However, if past presidential elections are any indication, roughly 42 to 46 percent of eligible voters will not show up to vote on Election Day. Pew Research Center conducted a poll in 2012 showing that only 129.1 million of 241 million eligible voters cast their ballots when President Obama was re-elected, and the numbers have not varied significantly within the past 50 years, nor are they expected to change this election. Comparatively, approximately 54 to 58 percent of Americans who are eligible to vote (i.e. 18 and up, not convicted of a felony, etc.) will elect the next President of the United States. Only 38 percent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 cast their ballots in 2012, according to census data. This group of voters, known as “Millennials” or “Generation Y,” has the lowest voter turnout among all age groups, including Generation X, Baby Boomers, and The Silent Generation. Even so, low voter turnout is not a rare phenomenon for young voters who, in 1964, peaked at 51 percent in voter participation. When asked why young people have such an abysmal voting record, Jack Warren ’20 spoke to a perceived futility in voting. “They feel like their vote doesn’t matter,” Warren said. “The electoral system is incredibly flawed…It’s very difficult to feel like your vote matters when you know that, no matter if you vote or not, your state’s going blue.” Oftentimes, the presidential election comes down to certain swing states like Florida and Ohio. For Warren, one vote may not decide the election, but each vote is important, especially if more and more people don’t vote. “If everyone adopted that mindset of ‘my vote doesn’t matter,’ then that wouldn’t be true,” he said. Co-Chair of the Wesleyan Democrats Simon Korn ’17 contends a similar argument. “Even if you don’t personally affect the outcome of the presidential election, or any election…you still should vote,” he said. “People who run for office spend lots of time and lots of money figuring out who votes, why they vote, and how best to represent you….If we as Millennials consistently vote in elections large and small, presidential, local, and state….People who run for office will take notice of that, and they will care about our interests.” In the 2012 presidential election, President Barack Obama received 67 percent of the youth vote, compared with Romney’s 30 percent, according to a study by Politico. In a study released days after President Obama secured his re-election, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University concluded the following: “If Governor Romney had won half of the youth vote, or if young voters had stayed home entirely, then Romney would have won instead of Obama.” Though the data itself includes figures from swing states like Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, it nevertheless articulates the influence the youth vote can have on presidential elections. Despite nearly 54 percent of the millennial voter population not voting in the 2012 presidential election, the percentage that did vote guaranteed Obama another four years in office. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump recognize how integral the youth vote is to the success of their individual campaigns. This is especially evident when comparing Clinton’s agenda before and after winning the Democratic nomination; she absorbed much of Bernie Sanders’ rhetoric on the economy and education, hoping to reproduce the enthusiasm millennials felt toward Sanders during his campaign. In fact, according to census data the the Pew Research center has analyzed, millennials are now a bigger voting force than any other generation, including the Baby Boomers. This means millennials could likely sway the vote in either Clinton or Trump’s favor. If those two options are unsatisfactory, Kati Young ’19 has an alternative. “This is an election where third-party candidates have had the strongest backing they’ve had in a long time, so if you’re interested in stopping the two-party system, then this might be a great opportunity,” she said. Young developed on the potentially monumental effect the youth vote can have on the presidential election. “Too many people have sacrificed to give me the privilege to vote for me not to vote,” she said. Young references, among other things, the fight for women’s suffrage, which ultimately led to the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, but her statement encompasses all groups whose voices, at one point or another, were silenced as a result of unjust laws, discrimination, and prejudice. Local and state elections, though often overlooked, play an equally important role in civic engagement. In an article written in The Washington Post on May 9, 2013, it was revealed that “Congressional approval averaged 15 percent, the lowest in nearly four decades of Gallup polling. And yet, 90 percent of House Members and 91 percent of Senators who sought re-election won last November. By 2014, the incumbency rate increased, while Congress’ approval rating decreased. This correlates with an article released by The Washington Post on Nov. 10, 2014 presenting statistics that showed “voter turnout for the 2014 midterms was the lowest it’s been in any election cycle since World War II.” Furthermore, outside the United States, in countries where leaders are not elected by the populace or where it is dangerous to vote, people are risking their lives to procure and uphold their right to vote. In the 2014 Afghanistan presidential election, approximately 7 million people voted despite recent attacks “carried out by Taliban militants,” including one on “the Afghanistan’s election commission headquarters,” according to a report by The Washington Post. Nonetheless, some argue that it is too difficult to register to vote, or that the process of filling out an absentee ballot is confusing and tedious. College students, who make up a large majority of the youth population, struggle to find time to register to vote in between classes and extracurricular activities. The requirements for filling out an absentee ballot vary from state to state, so it can be challenging to find information on a college campus pertaining specifically to one’s home state. Fortunately, Wesleyan offers ample resources to make the process as simple as possible. On the Wesleyan Office of the Registrar webpage, students can find under “General Information” links to information about registering to vote in the state of Connecticut, filling out an absentee ballot, and checking your voter registration status. If the information on the webpage is insufficient, Korn disclosed that the Wesleyan Democrats, in addition to collaborating with the Wesleyan Republicans on voter registration events both prior to and on Election Day, have found a possible solution to the anxiety that accompanies the absentee voting application process. “We’re going to have people in Usdan telling students how to vote in their home state,” Korn said. “People are going to come up to us, and we’re going to help them out individually one by one. That’s the only way to do it.” If none of that works, Korn strongly suggests turning toward the Internet. “Just Google ‘How to vote absentee in my state,’” Korn said. “What’s more, once you type ‘How to vote in my state’ in the search bar, Google automatically provides a template of information with step-by-step instructions explaining how to vote absentee. The same goes for when you type in ‘How to register to vote.’” Or, eligible voters can go to http://www.canivote.org/ and select their state, and the webpage leads directly to the state’s voter registration site where citizens can learn about deadlines and necessary documentation. “When it comes down to it, people have to make the decision on their own to vote and who to vote for,” Korn said."
"Why We Won’t Talk About War","2016-11-03","by Jake Lahut, Features Editor","With less than a week to go until Election Day—and given the collective nausea surrounding the 2016 presidential campaign—it might be better to wait to stave off debate about how we ignore our perpetual wars. If anything, this article is intended more for the archives than it is for the proverbial “undecided voter” whose mind might miraculously change because of a vapid opinion piece in a college newspaper. Nonetheless, the fact that we continuously compartmentalize and ignore our military conflicts abroad is shameful. The arena of our second-longest war, Afghanistan, was only mentioned once in this year’s presidential debates. The Vietnam War, our longest war, was seared into the minds of baby boomers, 9.7 percent of whom were involved in the conflict. Two thirds of those who served in Vietnam enlisted voluntarily, dispelling the relatively popular myth that most Vietnam veterans were coerced into combat by the draft. Without the draft and a comparable feeling of civic duty, millennials and Gen Xers have served in the Gulf War and the War on Terror in far fewer numbers. Less than one half of one percent of Americans have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2.5 million who have served in the War on Terror have seen more combat than previous veterans because the military now outsources non-combat-related services to contractors. Depending on the year, close to 30 percent of defense spending has gone to independent contractors who do anything and everything from serving food to gathering intelligence, and even to fighting in combat. There has been a litany of articles in media publications and academic journals about the outsize influence of Private Military Contractors (PMCs) on the United States Department of Defense, most notably with Halliburton and its connections to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Less removed from the machine of the military industrial complex is the widespread problem of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among veterans, with the greatest concerns arising from an alarmingly high suicide rate. Over 20 veterans commit suicide each day. Veterans face a 21 percent higher risk of suicide than the rest of the American population. Though there have been mini documentary segments about this on just about every major nightly news program and on myriad alternative news outlets, the American public by and large ignores the suffering of veterans, at best compartmentalizing it, and, at worst, outright not caring about it. How this has happened is a complicated question. Academics like Byron Nichols, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Union College, have suggested that one turning point in the American public’s attitude toward wars and engagement with service members came when military parades ceased after the Vietnam War. Longer term trends include a lack of news coverage from arenas of war by foreign correspondents. With the exception of a few organizations, Vice, for example, most major news organizations have cut back on foreign correspondents. Yet, at some point, we have to stop blaming institutions and accept that we are the institutions that perpetuate what we don’t like in the world. Blackwater didn’t get its money out of nowhere; we elected the members of Congress and president that made those appropriations. The inadequacy of coverage for vets with PTSD didn’t happen on its own; we made the conscious choice to care more about other issues when electing our representatives who sat on the Veterans Affairs Committee. We’re the ones who condemn the moral atrocities of war by not even showing up at the ballot box when it counted. We are the generation that would rather spout off on social media than write a letter or make a phone call to our elected officials telling them why we’ll vote them out if they don’t stand up against a lack of funding for the VA. We are a generation that spends billions of dollars on contractors who swear allegiance not to the flag, but to the almighty dollar. Even closer to home, we can support our Posse Veterans, of whom now there are around 30 on campus. While they don’t expect us to frantically go around thanking them for their service everywhere they go, we can do simple things like listening to their different experiences and refrain from morally judging their past. How we treat veterans on campus is a direct extension of how we treat veterans in our society writ large, and on a campus this small, we can make much more of a difference than on most other fronts. Given that we are four days away from a potential Trump presidency—which is closer than ever to happening, based on the latest forecast from FiveThirtyEight—many of the problems we face now that already seem awful could quickly become absurdly abhorrent. Given this country’s compartmentalization of our global military presence, the conditions for the rise of a fascist tyrant are all the ripe. One public figure who has made a consistent effort to engage with the grave realities of our military is NBC’s Willie Geist, who frequently brings up casualties and PTSD on “Morning Joe” and tweets out the daily number of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rukmini Callimachi of The New York Times is perhaps the best terrorism reporter in the world, finding her way into the chatrooms of the Islamic State and following major players that most people outside of the intelligence community otherwise wouldn’t know about. So after Election Day, and hopefully after Donald Trump picks up his toys and goes home, let’s start talking about the most impactful and largest scale thing this country does: waging war.

"Why We Must Talk to Trump Supporters","2016-11-10","by Jake Lahut, Features Editor","After reading the scores of heartfelt Facebook statuses, calling my parents, venting to my housemates, and seeing my Facebook friends who have supported President-Elect Donald J. Trump—or suddenly revealed that they voted for him despite concealing their support publicly—I am compelled to plead for something that will be deeply unpopular on Wesleyan’s campus: Please talk to Trump supporters, especially before the President-Elect is inaugurated. This is far easier and more accessible for some among us, mainly the proverbial cis-gendered heterosexual white male. Because of safety concerns alone given the violence provoked and perpetuated at many Trump rallies, talking to Trump supporters is far more difficult for people whose identities have been openly attacked by their candidate, notably—but by no means limited to—the Latino, Middle Eastern and South Asian diasporas, as well as black and Jewish Americans who have seen a precipitous rise in overt racism and anti-Semitism brought out by many Trump supporters, especially members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. Nonetheless, those among us who are able, but potentially not yet willing, must step up and speak to some of the 50 million or so Americans who voted for a historically defined fascist, or at least someone who pretended to be to initially promote his brand and later win the presidency. I worked on a book about Donald Trump for Mark Singer of The New Yorker. In the final product, “Trump and Me,” Singer holds two lenses to the rise of the real estate mogul turned fascist demagogue: his experience writing a profile of The Donald in 1996 that took several months, and the research we could come up with together on just about everything the man had said in public life relating to political positions, insofar as he has positions. Though I have nowhere near the amount of expertise on Trump as someone like my boss or Trump’s ghostwriter would have, I gained a healthy dose of perspective on Trump’s ability to alter what he says based on the audience in front of him. For many people reading this, that audience has never been us. One of the shocking things I’ve come to realize in the last few days—and, as Trump would say, ‘believe me, folks,’ there have been plenty—is the fact that, much like the so-called Beltway Elite that got the election wrong, many of my friends and colleagues at Wesleyan do not know any Trump supporters personally. I do. Some are former teammates, others closer friends, and some are family members. This proximity to dissent is becoming increasingly lost on our generation as we perpetually self-select and enclose ourselves in social media and our institutions of choice. Perhaps the most influential Trump supporter I’ve known is my late Uncle Woods, my mother’s youngest brother who died suddenly over the summer. We constantly argued about politics, sometimes with pleasure, others with anger and disdain. Whatever our feelings were, however uncomfortable we felt, we never shut each other out (unless my mom told us to take a break for the sake of the rest of the extended family at dinner). The important thing about debating with my proverbial conservative uncle wasn’t that it humanized a Trump supporter, it’s that we were better off engaging and disagreeing than talking past each other and letting animosity fester. Many Trump supporters were once on our side. There are over 200 counties in this country that elected Barack Obama twice, yet voted for Trump on Tuesday. This is hard to square with the fact that much of the momentum behind Trump’s rise stems from the backlash to the election of the nation’s first black president. Despite all of the progress made during the Obama administration, over 900 democratic state legislators were defeated over the course of his two terms. I don’t know how to explain all of this coherently and convincingly. I’ll leave that to the tireless journalists and academics who sacrifice sleep and their cherished relationships just to figure these things out. All I have is a hope that engagement with our political opponents can fight off the toxicity and danger of an intramural scrimmage turning into a war between alternate realities. Though I may not have known how important these debates were until my uncle was gone, I believe more than ever that just about everyone would benefit from having someone in their inner circle to vigorously disagree with. I’m fully aware that it’s far easier for someone like me to make this argument than it is for the people I’ve mentioned above, but there has to be a limit to our safe spaces and social justice jargon when people’s lives are at stake. Places like Wesleyan can become breeding grounds for fascism despite our best intentions. We have bred Trump supporters here, one of whom wrote at length about his conversion in today’s New York Times. No matter how invigorating it may be to live on the frontier of the political left, our rhetoric and sheer lack of empathy—mostly those of us who are not under attack by Trump’s rhetoric—for those who don’t share our verbose jargon make us no different than those on the alt-right and in the Tea Party who spurred Trump’s rise in the first place, minus a dictionary worth of terms 98 percent of the population doesn’t understand. Talking to Trump supporters and checking our jargon at the door doesn’t mean that we have to absolve them for political views that invalidate human lives, nor does it make us complicit in the dialectic of the neoliberal patriarchy and the post-truth rise of fascism, or whatever else we’ll call it from our classrooms high above in the ivory tower. What talking to Trump supporters does do, however, is make them realize that the PC liberal elite they hate, the abject Other they hate, and whoever else they want to take their country back from, are complex human beings just like them. Engaging with those we vehemently disagree with also reveals something about our character. It shows that not only can we reciprocate the humanization we lend them, but that we can take Michelle Obama’s high road and resist matching their hatred and ignorance with our own. Most importantly, this is what a civic society is all about, and we cannot preserve or improve it on our own. When I think back to how I felt by my uncle’s side, I don’t fear the loss of the republic or the horrors of fascism. Instead, a ball begins to grow in my throat as I long for one more shot to be in that position to change his mind, and to question my own assumptions. While I can’t confidently argue that a justifiable amount of good will come out of this national catastrophe, I have to believe that there’s still something we can do to make a difference. It all starts with a face-to-face conversation, a raise of the eyebrows, a huff of frustration, and a handshake—or even a hug—at the end, followed by an “until next time,” where you’ll vigorously disagree and be better off for it all over again.

"The Demise of the Democrats","2017-02-23","by Henry Spiro, Foreign Correspondent","What happened to the Democratic Party? Once the party of “hope and change,” the Democrats are incredibly fragmented and barely able to generate excitement around their message. They failed to elect someone who would be the first female President in U.S. history while she was running against an insane mad man and multi-million dollar “man of the people.” They’ve lost hold of the excitement they generated back in 2008 and become an absolute embarrassment at a time when the American people need them more than ever. As it currently stands, the Democratic Party is primarily divided into two groups: the ultra-progressive Berniecrats, and the left-of-center “pragmatic” Democrats who wish to continue with the same basic economic policies as former President Barack Obama. It’s a divide that likely had been growing since the beginning of Obama’s presidency, with the rise of “Occupy Wall Street” and other protests around the country that demanded radical changes in the United States’ economic policies after the Wall Street collapse of 2008. Now, after he departed from the White House, the Democrats are in worse shape than ever. The rift within the Democratic Party, however, became most apparent during the Democratic primaries of the 2016 presidential election, in which former independent and relatively unknown politician Bernie Sanders soared into the spotlight. He held massive, energetic rallies. He was impersonated by former “Seinfeld” producer and writer Larry David on Saturday Night Live and eventually made a cameo alongside him. He became a symbol of both American frustration and idealism, of rage at the machine and the belief that, with enough concentrated effort, it can be fixed. Bernie Sanders was an extraordinary force on the campaign trail, to the point where his name became one of the defining cultural icons of 2016. But once Bernie lost the primary and the excitement around his campaign began to fade, it became immediately clear that something was rotten with the state of the Democratic Party. How could an old socialist generate more excitement from progressives than Hillary Clinton, a candidate to be the first female President? How could the party of the working class alienate them so? How could a major party in America be openly advocating socialism when the term “liberal” was once taboo? It is now clear that the Democratic Party is deeply divided. Many were outraged at the “neoliberal” policies that they had been carrying out for years. From Bill Clinton to Obama and, if she had won, Hillary, Democrats had ignored the working classes and had far too much support for harmful trade deals and loose regulations. Furthermore, Obama had failed to live up to his much-hyped campaign promises, failing to end conflicts in the Middle East and not delivering on enough of the excitement and progress that his campaign had promised. On the most divisive and heated issues of American politics, from Occupy to Black Lives Matter, Obama responded with passivity, not willing to confront the issues head on. This left the Democrats in a fragile state, unable to meet the demands of the American people. The United States did not suddenly evolve into the liberal utopia many had expected Obama could create, leaving some Democrats bitter and spiteful. Now, with an election for DNC Chairman taking place this Sunday, the entire future of the Democratic Party is up for grabs. There are 10 candidates up for the job, but only two have a big enough national profile to have a legitimate chance of winning. Each is symbolic of the different sides of the Democratic divide. Do the Democrats go for the energetic, Bernie-esque progressive in the form of Keith Ellison? Or do they stick to Obama’s status quo in the form of his former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez? Either choice has obvious pros and cons. Perez would continue to push for Obama-era policies, which are more practical than anything a Berniecrat would push and could genuinely help the economy. The downside of continuing with Obama’s policies is that they represent more of the same: some tax raises, obnoxious and uncompromising Republican pushback, etc. More importantly than the details of his actual policies, however, is that this sameness will limit the appeal of both Perez and the Democratic Party as a whole. If this election (and, in its own way, the 2008 election of Barack Obama) has proven anything, it’s that people hate the status quo. Everyone wants something to change; the system is broken; revolution is necessary; “Make America Great Again.” His policies may or may not work in practice, but his status as “more of the same” makes him a totally unexciting and uninspiring choice. Ellison, on the other hand, is more of a Sanders surrogate, representing the progressive, far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Ellison is the far more exciting choice for the Democrats. He represents a revolutionary change in the status quo along the lines of everyone’s favorite grandpa (Sanders, obviously). He could energize the base of Democratic supporters in a way that Hillary never could and that Obama only could back in 2008. Based on voting data, a more progressive, further left-wing Democratic Party is seemingly what this country wants. Ellison is the first Muslim to be elected to U.S. Congress, making him the perfect symbol of Trump opposition. His early support of Sanders’ campaign will help gain the support of young voters disillusioned by the centrist wing of the party. He could dust off the cobwebs of the aging Democratic Party and encourage political activism for left-wing causes in a way that America needs right now. Because now, perhaps more than ever, America needs civic engagement in its political system. In case you haven’t been paying attention, the President of the United States is a both a fearmongerer and an idiot, incapable of articulating sentences correctly while having mastered the art of scapegoating everyone’s problems on Mexico and Muslims. Not only that, but every major move he makes, from bashing and discrediting the media to his worrying relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggests he’s an autocrat waiting to seize power. The moment in history we are living through is, as best said by military historian Eliot A. Cohen, “…one of those clarifying moments in American history….” It is a time in which the foundations of our democracy are threatened by an unstable, power-hungry leader with no regard for the Constitution or acknowledgment of any restraints on his power. Furthermore, he ran on the Republican Party ticket and energized their base voters in a way that hasn’t been seen in years. In doing so, he’s given the Republicans every reason to support him: If they don’t, they’ll lose popularity and be unable to pass their agenda. When Speaker of the House Paul Ryan criticized Trump for his leaked tape with Billy Bush, Ryan’s popularity among Republicans dropped by 28 points in just over a week. Other prominent Republicans seem to be more interested in passing their agenda and holding onto their political careers than, say, having basic principles and a moral backbone. So, as former G.W. Bush speechwriter David Frum has argued, Trump and his power grabs are unlikely to be opposed by Republicans. America now finds itself in a perilous place, facing an ironic plot twist: The party of big government is now the only major check on government power. Which is why their internal divides must be healed and they must unify regardless of who becomes Chairman this weekend. Ultimately, the Democrats must do what the Republicans can do best: unify around an agenda, whatever it may be. The major divides within the left, if unhealed, could spell doom for not only the future of the Democratic Party, but of a free democracy in America. The Democratic Party must save America from itself. Hopefully they can save themselves first. Spiro is a member of the Class of 2019."
