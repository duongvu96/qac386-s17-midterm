"Dean’s office under review","2003-10-31","by Xiomara Lorenzo, Editor-in-Chief","Dean of the College Freddye Hill resigned from her position on Wednesday, Oct. 22 and continues to decline to comment on the specific circumstances surrounding her unexpected leave. She agreed to speak on her tenure at the University and tentative plans for the future. According to Hill and President Douglas Bennet, the Office of the Dean of College is currently under review.  Vice President Peter Patton will serve as interim dean. Senior Associate Provost and Dean of Continuing Studies Billy Weitzer, Director of Affirmative Action Kathryn Friedman and Dean of Student Services Michael Whaley are working with Patton to manage the day-to-day operation of the Dean’s Office.  Patton also served as interim dean in 1997-98 prior to Hill’s appointment by a search committee.  According to Bennet, a national search for a permanent successor will be launched this winter. “We are going to take a look at if it is one job or two,” Bennet said. “We need to have a good answer to that so that [the position] doesn’t overwhelm. Peter Patton is fulfilling everything [Hill] did and he’s doing it with the support she didn’t have.” Hill said she had hoped to establish a discourse meant to encourage more members of the community to share their ideas prior to her resignation. She said that too often during past forums and organized gatherings, the same student voices would control the direction of the meeting. “We need to make safe spaces for these kinds of voices; certain perspectives are truncated because the discourse is dominated by a few perspectives and voices who, to some extent, frame discussions, debates and issues,” she said. Hill also expressed a desire to see improvements made to the Honor Code and the Code of Non-Academic Conduct.  “I had many goals,” Hill said.  “One that I did not achieve was to develop dialogues about diversity at Wesleyan in the 21st century.  I also regret that I was not able to implement the recommendations from the task force on the Honor Code and the Code of Non-Academic Conduct, which, in my view, are critical to strengthening the sense of community as well as personal accountability and responsibility.” Prior to her arrival at the University, Hill spent eight years at Haverford College—four as associate dean of the college and director of minority affairs and four as dean of the college.  “I learned the true meaning of trust as an essential element in a learning community,” Hill said. “By this I mean, I learned that in order to fully participate in the life of a community, you must trust those around you, even when you disagree with their views and beliefs.” She returned to Spelman College, her alma mater, and assumed the position of vice president for student affairs for four years, followed by a six-year term as academic dean. “At Spelman, I had the opportunity to collaborate with others to strengthen the curriculum, improve the campus environment, and learn a lot about leadership from one of America’s great educators and leaders: Johnnetta B. Cole,” Hill said. Hill left Spelman, with Wesleyan as a potential location for her next move. “I was attracted to Wesleyan because of the statement about liberal learning. I believe learning and education are liberating and empowering,” she said. “The statement about liberal learning resonated with my beliefs, and I said, ‘Oh yes, this is a learning community I would like to join.’” According to surveys tracking student satisfaction with education and campus experiences since 1995, there has been an overall steady increase in student satisfaction with their education, co-curricular activities and campus climate. “Wesleyan is not a perfect place, but it keeps getting better as measured by data from surveys, the consistent increase in the retention rate, and, in my view, the overall level of student engagement inside and outside the classroom,” Hill said. Hill plans to remain at her on campus residence at least until the end of the end of June 2004.  “I see myself as an educator, and I enjoy the type of work that I have done,” she said. “I am taking time to reflect and decide what I would like to do in the future.” Hill said she hopes she will be remembered for her contributions toward strengthening the sense of community, improving the campus environment, generating trust and mutual respect between students and the administration and helping to affirm community standards, specifically through contributions to the Honor Code and the Code of Non-Academic Conduct. “I have learned a lot during my tenure as dean of the college,” she said. “One of the most important lessons was learning to listen carefully and critically to different opinions and beliefs. I have also learned a great deal about other cultures and experiences. I believe I am a better person because of my experiences and interaction with people from diverse backgrounds and perspectives.” She will also be remembered for her work with student to organizations and student governance, especially with the WSA. “I enjoyed working with a cross-section of people from every division in the University,” Hill said.  “I felt comfortable with the way things were going, and I believe the administration, faculty, staff and students will continue to solve problems and take advantage of opportunities that will improve Wesleyan and student experiences.”"
"The Dining Committee and Thai Gardens","2003-12-05","by Rebecca SolowSohana Punithakumar,","The Wesleyan Student Assembly and the Dining Advisory Committee are excited to welcome the Thai Gardens restaurant as a partner in providing expanded dining services to Wesleyan students, as well as encouraging a stronger relationship between the university and our surrounding community.  With the introduction of Thai Gardens as an interim dining option, we hope to increase student patronage of Middletown businesses as well as provide students with a dining alternative.  This program serves a dual role as part of a larger commitment of the WSA to strengthen Wesleyan’s engagement with Middletown, as well as to enhance dining services.   The Dining Committee, which is composed of representatives from the Wesleyan Student Assembly, Aramark, the food service workers’ union, university administration, the United Student Labor Action Coalition, and the Environmental Organizers’ Network, was charged with selecting the location for our interim off-campus dining program.  After much discussion, the committee chose Thai Gardens because of its menu, its labor practices and its commitment to the program.  All members of the Dining Committee participated actively in this conversation, with the union steward representing Local 217 indicating Thai Gardens as her preference.  The WSA decided to go forward with this program after much deliberation and consultation with university administrators, Aramark, the union and students.  In the interest of compromise, the WSA has limited the use of points off-campus to weekdays after 8 p.m. and on weekends for this academic year only.  We feel assured that union workers will not lose jobs as a direct result of the implementation of this temporary dining option. We expect that students will be able to take full advantage of the addition of Thai Gardens as a valuable participant in Wesleyan’s dining program.  We look forward to continuing the positive relationship established between Wesleyan University and Thai Gardens in the hopes that this will serve as a bridge between Wesleyan and the Middletown community."
"All in Goodspeed","2004-02-06","by ,","The recent opening of the Inn at Middletown and increasing prestige of Middletown restaurants have added to the town’s status as a culturally flourishing area. Now, Mayor Dominique Thornton has taken another significant step toward this cultural expansion by inviting Goodspeed Operahouse to join the Middletown community. President Bennet immediately stepped forward to support the potential move by attending a meeting with the Goodspeed Board of Trustees and publishing an opinion piece in the Hartford Courant. Bennet’s involvement, which is a clear vote of support for the Middletown community, will strengthen town-gown relations and open Wesleyan’s gates to new theatrical possibilities. The Opera House would become another draw for tourists from around the state and would boost Middletown’s already growing economy. Middletown is on the right track, and Goodspeed would help it stay there.  The Opera House is not only a good idea for Middletown. For students, the center would provide opportunities for many levels of involvement, including possible internships and student discounts on performances at a professional venue. Goodspeed itself would benefit from an available student body and growing cultural community, and the University would reap the rewards of an enriched location. Now that Bennet has made his stand, it is up to him and the rest of the University to follow through. Students can find out more about Goodspeed by visiting www.goodspeed.org, and can send e-mails to the organization to encourage their move to Middletown. As for President Bennet, he should be congratulated for his endorsement and encouraged to stay on track.  Hopefully between Bennet and Mayor Thornton, enough encouragement will be fostered to bring Goodspeed Operahouse to Middletown."
"Mel Gibson to speak at commencement","2004-04-02","by Rae Kaplan, Arts Editor","Popular actor and director Mel Gibson, will give the Commencement address this May, the President’s Office announced yesterday. Already, the Administration and student-body alike have expressed reacted ‘passionately.’ Inspired by Gibson’s latest directing endeavor, “The Passion of the Christ,” professors from the Film Department and the Religion Department teamed together to bring Gibson to the University. “With Wesleyan’s constantly growing Film Department, we feel that the strides Mr. Gibson has been making in his career reflect the direction of greatness we only hope our programs here will achieve,” said Jeanine Basinger, Film Chair. Like Wesleyan students, Gibson is not afraid to take risks and stir people up as evidenced by “The Passion.” The months preceding the movie’s release were filled with controversy and protests, favorite pastimes of the University community. “’Passion’ has led to many provocative conversations on campus, in every sect of spirituality. I am very excited by the implications this has for May’s Commencement,” said Rabbi David Leipziger, the University Jewish Chaplain. Students pro and anti-Gibson can’t suppress their anticipation of Gibson’s arrival, though they have their various reasons.  “After seven years here, now when I tell people I went to Wesleyan they can say ‘Oh, the small-liberal arts school in Middletown where Mel Gibson spoke,’ not ‘Huh? The girls’ school?’ This is the big break Wesleyan needs,” said Gibson fan Mike Jones ’04, who will finally be graduating this May, with Gibson as his witness. “I think it’s an outrage to have an anti-Semite address our class, but I’m so thrilled for all the activism this allows for. We’ve already started to plan fliers, t-shirts, rallies, petitions and- off the record- chalking.  It’s gonna be a blast! This is exactly how I want to remember my years at Wesleyan,” said Sara Martin ’04. With his trophy case of awards from the Academy, Blockbuster, MTV, and People’s Choice (to name a few), Gibson’s greatness equals, and possibly even surpasses, the prize-winning hall of fame of Wesleyan Commencement speakers who’ve never won an Oscar, but maybe a Nobel. The University has teamed up with Destinta Movie Theaters to fully capitalize on the event. After the ceremony and Gibson’s address, the new graduates will be able to view a special screening of “The Passion” at Destinta and enjoy a medium popcorn and soda for only three dollars if they present their cap and gown at the door. “It’s obviously great publicity for our theater to have a Hollywood star at a screening of his movie, but I am a little worried about Wesleyan students protesting.  I guess that’s the price of superstardom,” said Tony Andrews, Destinta Manager. Churches from throughout the New England area have already begun organizing pilgrimages to come see Gibson at the University, feeling he is a modern day prophet. Father Louis Manzo, University Catholic Chaplain, also hopes to connect to Jesus through Gibson. “It would be great to have another ceremonial rededication of the renovated Chapel with Gibson presiding with Jesus by his side,” he said. It took a lot of effort for the University to get the busy Gibson to give the Commencement address, but President Doug Bennet pulled through to ensure a memorable ceremony for the graduating class and their families. However, President Bennet couldn’t do it all by himself and credits his loving wife Midge for her relentless support and encouragement- or in other words, nagging- until Gibson was secured. “Mel’s a hunk,” she said. “I would never be able to forgive myself for letting this opportunity slip away.”"
"Administration to phase out off-campus housing in upcoming years","2004-04-20","by Eliza Simon, Staff Writer","Although immediate changes seem unlikely, the days of off-campus housing for Wesleyan students are numbered.  For now, the system of granting off-campus status remains the same, according to Assistant Director of Residential Life Rich DeCapua. However, he asserted that changes to the University’s housing options over the next few years will eliminate the need for off-campus housing. Currently, the number of students allotted off-campus status is determined each year by a calculation that takes into account the University’s housing capacity, current enrollment, and projected enrollment for the incoming first-year class. Due to these factors, a record 200 students have been granted permission to live off-campus for the 2004-2005 school year, DeCapua said. Off-campus status is granted by class year. Seniors have first priority in this process, followed by juniors and then sophomores. Students who miss the deadline to apply for off-campus status or who have bad luck in the housing lottery can be placed on a waitlist for off-campus places.  “It’s all a numbers game,” DeCapua said. “The only thing that has changed for next year is the number of [off-campus] spots.” The University grants off-campus status because there are not enough on-campus rooms to accommodate all of Wesleyan’s students. Once the new residential halls are built, however, administrators project that the University will be able to adequately house all of its students. “One of the unique things about Wesleyan is that we have a residential community,” DeCapua said. “The ideal would be to get rid of off-campus housing entirely.” Director of University Communications Justin Harmon explained that minimizing off-campus housing will help to create a more centralized campus as distinct from the neighborhoods that surround it. “We need to better develop [and] define the edges of campus vis-à-vis the residential areas,” he said.  According to Harmon, the new Fauver Field housing, which will replace In-town, will help to achieve this goal. For its purposes, Harmon said that In-town is not a viable neighborhood for students due in part to its location. This decision came about after extensive discussion among administrators, students and neighbors.  “[Once built, the Fauver Field housing] will create a better articulated edge between town and gown,” he said.  Some students expressed concern about the University’s plan to get rid of the off-campus housing option. “Living off-campus is a great way for students to save money, live in a nice place and avoid the stress of the housing lottery,” said Jessica Weidmann ’05, who will live at an  off-campus house in the fall. “It will definitely be cheaper to live off-campus next year, as long as we can find summer sub-letters.”  DeCapua acknowledged that students may choose to live off-campus because of financial concerns, but said that those students were trading savings for responsibility. According to DeCapua, the higher cost of living in University-owned housing is offset by its benefits. “In off-campus housing, you’re really on your own,” DeCapua said. “That’s your game. You have to deal with your landlord and your lease. But on-campus there are amenities: you can put in a work order to get a light bulb fixed, and Public Safety will patrol your area.”  Off-campus fraternities and other student organizations will also need to reconsider their status once off-campus housing ceases being a possibility for students.  “Fraternities, as a practical manner, will have to be a part of program housing if they want to be housing students,” Harmon said. According to DeCapua, the University projects that the two Fauver Field residential halls—one of which will house first-years and the other upperclassmen—will open in time for the 2005-2006 school year. At that point, he said, off-campus housing status will no longer be available for most students. The Office of Residential Life will continue to make exceptions in this policy for students with “special considerations,” such as medical concerns.  “Our main priority is to house students,” said DeCapua, “but any time we can house students on campus, we will.”"
"Class of 2008 meets high standards","2004-09-02","by Elizabeth Ody, News Editor","Last Monday the Wesleyan community officially welcomed the Class of 2008 onto campus. According to the official profile released by the Office of Admission, the new group of students is in line with admissions trends of past years. Of 6,568 applications received, 28%, or 1,843 students, were admitted. Forty percent of those students accepted the University’s offer, filling out the class of 2008 with 729 students. Thirty-eight percent of the student body was admitted through early decision. The number of applications decreased by about 400 since last year, as did the number of early decision students.  According to Greg Pyke, Senior Associate Dean of Admission, the decrease in early decision applicants was due in part to a great deal of bad press.  “We’d been hearing in the press a lot about whether or not early decision is a good process, and whether it favors some groups,” Pyke said.  This trend is balanced out by the increase in yield, from 38% to 40%, which means that more students who are offered admission decided to accept Wesleyan’s offer.  “We heard from many students that although Wesleyan is their top choice, they don’t want to go early,” Pyke said.  Median SAT scores are up slightly from last year. The median math score is 700, as opposed to 690 last year, and the median verbal score remained at 700. The ACT median score is 31, the same as last year. According to Nancy Meislahn, Dean of Admission and Financial Aid, the most important qualities the Office of Admission looks for in candidates are leadership and engagement in and out of the classroom and the motivation and preparation to work across the entire curriculum.  “About one third of those admitted will have held leadership positions,” Meislahn said. Eighty-two percent of admitted students have taken biology, chemistry and physics, and 76% have taken calculus. Pyke said that, as in other years, the Office of Admission has tried to take into account each applicant’s background and capabilities, and what sorts of opportunities have been available to the applicant. Eleven percent of admitted students are the first generation in their family to go to college, and 24% of admitted students have at least one parent who did not attend college.  Students of color, including international students, totaled at 37% or 225 students. Sixteen percent, or 119, are Asian/Asian-American as opposed to 102 last year, with 81 matriculates from the US. Latino/Hispanic students, including international students, dropped from 62 to 56 this year. The number of Black/African American students fell from 56 last year to 45 this year, including international students. There are also five Native Americans in the new class. Pyke and Meislahn agreed that the declining number of Black/African American students is a problem, and said that the Office of Admission is working on several initiatives to reverse that trend.  “This year we were concerned about black student enrollment from pretty early in the process, because applications from black students did not go up this year,” Pyke said.  According to Pyke, part of the problem is that Wesleyan is losing Black/African American applicants to Ivy League schools and other large highly competitive Universities.  Pyke noted that this year reinforces the trend of a growing number of international students.  “The international student group is the largest it’s ever been this year” Pyke said. Seven percent of the class is composed of international students, including one student from the island of Mauritius.  According to Pyke, the international student body is composed of two groups: non-U.S. citizens who are looking for higher education, and Americans who have lived overseas for most of their lives. While students in the second group do not technically count as international students, these students will still be able to bring a multicultural perspective to the University. “Wesleyan feels that the best liberal arts education is in international education,” Pyke said. Pyke also noted that non-US citizens who seek education abroad are competitively sought after by the very top schools in the country, so it is significant that Wesleyan has attracted so many international students. The incoming class is also geographically diverse. As usual the Mid-Atlantic ranked first, with 38 percent of the new class, and New England in second with 25 percent. Students from the West total 13 percent, and those from the Midwest and from outside the US tied at nine percent. The smallest percentage of students comes from the South, with five percent. Pyke and Meislahn were both excited to be welcoming three students from Alabama and, for the first time in many years, one student from North Dakota. Over the last ten years the number of applications received has increased by 20 percent, and selectivity has increased by eight percent.  “The common thread among Wesleyan students and successful Wesleyan applicants is a curiosity—about the world, about one’s place in it, about other ideas, perspectives and experiences,” Meislahn said. “And, by those measures and characteristics, the class of 2008 meets our very high standards.”"
"Off-campus plan widens town-gown divide","2004-09-21","by ,","Next year, the University will force all students, except in a handful of extraordinary circumstances, to live on-campus. This change represents another step toward the University’s Master Plan, which will require all students to live in a few large, characterless, University-built dorms.  These changes are hurtful to the students and to the University for many reasons and they need to be reconsidered. Currently, students and Middletown residents (Non-University Personnel, in the tactful jargon of the Administration) live in a symbiotic world as neighbors and landlords. This closeness helps foster good relations and the sense that all of us belong to a community larger than Wesleyan. Forcing students to isolate themselves in dorms on-campus is contradictory to the spirit of integration and will only aggravate the deteriorating relations between campus and community. And let’s not discuss the financial devastation local landlords would incur from the removal of all students from their rental properties.  At the same time, living off-campus allows students to save money. The Administration claims that once all students are assigned on-campus housing, it will consider requests from students in dire financial need for off-campus status so that they will not have to pay the annual $6,000 on-campus housing bill. All students should have the right to shop around to save money, not just those on financial aid. They should also have the right to deal directly with landlords about privacy, pets and other issues rather than simply conform to University regulations.  Finally, it is a huge and much-appreciated convenience for upperclassmen to be able to move in and get settled before the official University-designated move-in date. Off-campus housing also allows students to stay in the same residence for multiple years, which forges stronger relationships between classmates and housemates. It has been found that such bonding leads to increases in alumni donating, an aspiration of any University.  We realize that having all students close together keeps our community tight. Still, segregating students from the greater community while integrating them into the ever-expanding reaches of the Administration needs to be avoided for Wesleyan to maintain its reputation as fostering political awareness and community service."
"Former Israeli MP discusses peace process","2004-10-12","by Elizabeth Ody, News Editor","Former member of the Israeli parliament Naomi Chazan spoke in Shanklin 107 on Monday about the obstacles that currently hinder peace between Israel and Palestine. About 80 students showed up to hear Chazan discuss the possibility of a two-state solution to the conflict.  The talk, titled “Practical Implications of Liberal Zionism: Obstacles to Peace in the Middle East,” was organized by Kol Israel, a student Zionist group. Members of Kol Israel said that they were hoping to dispel some of the preconceptions about Zionism by bringing Chazan to campus. “Especially last year, I think people may have made assumptions about Kol Israel’s views, and about the people we brought to speak,” said Nitzan Ziv ’07, a member of Kol Israel. “For a left Zionist voice to be heard was essential for Kol Israel.” According to Chazan, the only line of action that will potentially solve the conflict is to return to negotiations. She advocated a re-examination of old agreements, such as the Geneva Accord and the Oslo Accord, in order to determine how these agreements failed. Chazan also emphasized that the desire for a two-state solution is enormous among both Palestinians and Israelis, and that a minority of extremists in power are hindering this type of solution. “Never before in the history of the conflict has there been overwhelming agreement on the nature of the solution to the problem,” she said. “70 percent of Israelis support a Palestinian state and disengagement from Gaza.” According to Chazan the primary obstacles to reaching an agreement are occurring both in Israel and Palestine. A breakdown of trust, the rise to power of extremists, the existing political systems, conflicting narratives and lack of involvement from the international community are the greatest problems, she said.  As Chazan spoke, Kol Israel circulated a pledge for the audience to sign, stating “we affirm our recognition of the state of Israel as a legitimate, sovereign, and free nation, equal among other nations.” There are five main lines of action available, according to Chazan, the worst of which is to do nothing. She mentioned the Sharon disengagement plan, a one-state solution, and an International Trusteeship or mandate as possible, albeit unsatisfactory, actions. Chazan stressed that negotiations are the only option that may lead to a permanent solution. “There is nothing more volatile in our region than the status quo,” she said. “We’ll have to take decisive action in 2005, one way or another, or the situation will explode.” “As someone with left-wing views I was really grateful to hear that contrasting views were expressed from a position of leadership in Israel,” said Leora Abelson ’07. “There’s this stigma that Zionism has associated with racism, it’s just not true,” said Niv Elis ’05, a member of Kol Israel. “There’s a whole spectrum of perspectives that are Zionist.”  Chazan was born and raised in Jerusalem and attended Barnard College. She was a member of the Israeli Knesset from 1992 to 2003, where she served as the deputy speaker, chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights, and a member of the Foreign Affairs and Security Committee. She is currently a professor in the political science department of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and is the Robert Wilhelm Fellow of the Center for International Studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology."
"Store on Main Street promotes alternative healing","2004-10-26","by Marcus Braham, Metro News Editor","Yvette Page, owner of A New Page, a healing store at 644 Main Street, has been promoting eclectic spiritualities in Middletown for almost two years now. According to Page, who moved her store to 644 Main Street in January 2003, her shop is a feel-good store that promotes the well being of the body, mind, and spirit.  The store carries products such as wind chimes, candles, puzzles, incense, pendulums, jewelry, and healing herbs such as peppermint, jasmine, and chamomile. “Herb is the oldest magic in the world,” Page said, adding that they are also at the center of healing methods of Eastern cultures and religions. “Our [Western] society is just catching on to the benefits of Eastern medicine and religions. We need to turn back to what the earth has offered us.” The New Page store also has a small but growing section of recovery and spiritual books. Many of the books in Page’s store focus on getting over addictions. “I always wanted a recovery bookstore,” Page said. “People really do want to feel better, and my goal is to get the tools that they need in their hands.” Over a decade ago, Page turned to recovery books to help her battle alcoholism. Though she was attending Alcohol Anonymous, she said that she still needed something more spiritual.  “Something like AA only treats the symptoms and not the problem,” Page said. According to Page, Eastern and alternative healing modalities better target heath problems. Page also said that she has noticed that alternative healing modalities are being incorporated increasingly in more and more medical practices. “Today doctors are being trained in herbalism,” Page said. “There are lots of things that we have been trained not to recognize. But now this archaic knowledge is coming into mainstream.” Page was motivated to open up A New Page in September 2003 when she was laid off from her job. She drew a blueprint of the store and kept it on her refrigerator. Soon thereafter, Page began to write a business plan to submit to investors.  Page said the store’s name was inspired by her son. Initially, she wanted to call the store Page’s, but that name, however, was already taken by a store in Deep River, CT. Page had just celebrated a birthday, so her son suggested that she call the store A New Page.  The name of the store is not only a metaphor for Page herself, who has been sober for the past 10 years, but also for her new entrepreneurial skills. One of the factors that compelled Page to open up her store in Middletown was the presence of Wesleyan University. In her proposal, Page wrote that students pursing a liberal arts education are generally more accepting of alternative lifestyles, less loyal to conventional thinking, and seeking new ways of thinking. “There is a sensitivity up there [at Wesleyan] that is filtering downtown,” Page said. “It starts with the cultural diversity of the school; this made it okay for this shop to open.” Page also said that there is support from the Middletown community for alternative healing modalities. According to Page, there is a significant population of Buddhists in the Middletown area with the interest in the peaceful tactics and organic living of Western Buddhism.  Running a business in the North End of Main Street, Page said that she feels the same pressures as any other starting businesses.  ‘Sometimes people are put off by the neighborhood, but I feel safe here,“ Page said. ”This is all part of the revitalization of Main Street’s north end. The neighborhood here needs healing, too. We need to get more people up here.“ Dorothy Goertz, a customer who frequents A New Page, said she found a book that she has been looking for many years.  ”It was a book about esteem and love, that I have given to a coworker,“ Goertz said. ”When I saw it in the store front, I ran in quickly because I had wanted to give it to my husband to-to-be as an engagement gift.“ Page is looking to expand the book collection and also begin offering massage therapy in her store."
"Open Letter to Doug Bennet","2004-12-10","by Bay LoveAxzyr DeLeonAna WeibgenTito Soto-CarrionAna PortillaMarta Martinez, Class of 2005, 2007, 2005, 2007, 2007, and 2005","Dear President Bennet, We are writing to address your response to Zach Goldstein that, “Because the agreed-upon rules of the forum were broken, the administration does not plan to send any joint communication” to alumni. First of all, the agreement to send a joint communication was never dependent in any way on the success or failure of yesterday’s forum. The terms to which you and the 250 or so students who assembled in your office agreed were that a joint communication to alumni would be sent if the wording of such a communication could be agreed upon. I quote the statement you made in the e-mail you sent to the entire Wesleyan campus: “The students and the administration are committed to sending a joint report about the current situation to the alumni by Wednesday, December 15, if the text can be mutually agreed upon.” To insist now that you have the right to go back on that statement merely because the forum did not go entirely as you had expected is simply in bad faith. Second, while we are the first to acknowledge that the last thirty minutes of the forum were somewhat chaotic, we object to your assertion that we broke the “agreed-upon rules” of the forum. A group of students met at noon on the day of the forum to discuss its format, and we mutually agreed upon guidelines that were later accepted by members of the administration with whom several students conferred before the forum. One of the terms on which all agreed was that you would be given a chance to “respond.” Unfortunately for all concerned, the exact nature of this response was left unspecified, which resulted in differing interpretations and disorder. The understanding of many of the students involved was that you would be given an opportunity to give brief, specific responses to each of the issues and demands voiced by members of the community during the forum—to respond, in other words, to each of the demands as they were read off of the list. We had then planned to allow you to respond however you wished after we read our request for the proposal you agreed to present this community on January 19th. We did not give you advance notice of the fact that we would be making this request – a fact that may have resulted in your mistaken impression that we were not going to allow you to speak at all – because we wanted our question to be asked and answered in the presence of the entire Wesleyan community, not behind closed doors. Nonetheless, you were promised, and were given, an opportunity to respond, and to insist that you were “silenced” or that we broke the rules of engagement is wrong. We have also received notice that Dean Patton intends to “work with the elected student leadership to structure the January meeting.” However, yesterday’s forum was a result of the fact that many members of this community do not feel that existing avenues for change – including the WSA – are adequate. It is unacceptable that you would bypass the voices of the hundreds of students and community members who showed up at the forum yesterday and worked so hard to bring it about in favor of yet another closed-door negotiation with the WSA. Regards, Bay Love, Axzyr DeLeon, Ana Weibgen, Tito Soto-Carrion, Ana Portilla and Marta Martinez"
"The WSA’s role on campus","2004-12-10","by Zach Kolodin, Class of 2007","This wespeak is a response to recent protests on campus and is in the context of the WSA’s silence on these important student issues. I will not affirm my support or my opposition to the issues themselves. Nevertheless, the protests have been remarkable, and the progress has been heartening. I hope that these events lead to improved student representation and voice on campus, and positive progress for the issues of the movement. Nevertheless, there has been misinformation. I believe that there is a shared blame for the misinformation on campus. The WSA has offered numerous forums to students which have been extremely poorly attended (on a broad swath of issues, including but not limited to safety, gender-neutral housing, off-campus housing, and WESU), but apparently has not done an adequate job conveying information to students about what has been happening in the assembly and in the various committees.  I will do my best to convey some of this information, which has gone unclarified up until this point. I am clearly not privy to all the information that students might want to know but I will give my best shot: •Gender-neutral housing: this issue HAS NOT been tabled. It is currently being discussed in the Student Life Committee, which contains ample student and administrative representation. Peter Patton and Elaine Garven (egarven@wes) chair this committee. Progress has obviously been unacceptably slow, but the WSA has worked assiduously to get this done. •Senior Woodframe Houses: These are not going away. Those that are structurally unsound may be torn down, and replaced by newly built houses. The construction of the Fauver Field dorm will accommodate those who might have lived in Intown, while the woodframes will remain an option. •Off-campus housing: The administration is clearly committed to eliminating off-campus housing. Nevertheless, Nathan Victoria (nvictoria) is writing a document to demonstrate the necessity of off-campus housing. Your input would be valuable.  •Safety (the RIDE): WSA fought the administration as they took away escort and brought in the RIDE. There have been some successes: in addition to the two RIDE loops (x3788), there is also a special services van (same number, ask for special services) for students who live off the RIDE route or need special assistance of any kind. We have also held two student forums (both poorly attended) in trying to build a broad-based committee (including all types of community members) to lobby the administration on this issue. We continue to work on this issue and will present a plan in January (contact nvictoria@wes, or bmitchell@wes). •Safety (Hate Crimes): The safety committee (which has open membership) has attempted to address this issue. Nevertheless, there has been little community interest. We continue to work on these issues. The contact people are Brittany Mitchell (bmitchell) and Nora Connor (nconnor). •Diversity Training: The administration now mandates diversity training for all staff members (effective next fall), although faculty members are still not mandated to do this. On this particular issue, it is near impossible to mandate faculty to undergo training unless they agree. They are an entirely self-governing body and the reform would likely have to come from within. •Ethnic Studies: There are members of the assembly with voice and vote in the Educational Policy Committee of the faculty. We are willing to work with any students that have ideas about curricular reform. Contact me (zkolodin), or Karen Courtheoux (kcourtheoux). Let me be clear about how I see the role of the WSA. We are your democratically elected representatives. Our sole interest is representing student voice. Up until now, we have not done a sufficient job demonstrating to the student body how we represent them. There are clear limits to our power on campus: we do not have final say on any campus issue unless the administration grants it to us. Nevertheless, we are a dynamic resource: elected student representatives sit on a variety of important committees that oversee student life on campus, and our top officials definitely have the administration’s ear if not their minds. We have voice and vote, and we do our best most of the time, even if we lose some of our battles. Those battles that we win are not always publicized, because changes that are not made do not make the news. I cannot speak for the entire assembly (and throughout this statement, I have spoken only from my personal perspective), but I desperately want to regain the mandate of the students. We will continue to reach out to students in the ways that we have previously done, and will expand our outreach in other forums. Please utilize the resources offered here; the greater the engagement of students in legislative affairs, the louder our voices can be."
"Please stop silencing","2004-12-10","by Melissa Rosario, Class of 2005","Dear Justin Martinez, When I read your wespeak last week, I was filled with an overwhelming feeling of déjà vu. Did I just read a piece on “respect” or did I just watch the investigative news report CBS’s “shame on you?” In your effort to “expose” the dishonor of the not-so-post colonial “traitors,” you seemed to have missed the overall irony of the fact that your article was a direct defensive attack on the emotion and substance of performances/writings by Marta and Raquel; that your piece read as the absence of respect and the presence of non-engagement. In that, I believe it is most necessary to reiterate their statement that we “…identify who is killing activism.” I think what Marta and Raquel wrote and performed was less about themselves and “slandering” others as you call it and more about disrupting the history of misrepresentation and homogenization at Wesleyan which is taken to be the norm. When this tendency was fought from within (both the community and the show), your response to these actions is indicative of a belief that the norm articulated is always “positive and empowering” and a refusal to take into consideration that this is not everyone’s experience. In your terms, criticism from within is disruptive of camaraderie and not a way to more fully express camaraderie through difference. This is a limitation motivated by defensiveness and self-protection. In designating properness and expertise as opposite to actions motivated by emotions, you’ve silenced your fellow performers. Moreover you’ve taken a patronizing approach to expressing culture.  This fact lies most explicitly within the trend I saw articulated in your piece which is the removal/denial of the larger ways in which power operates. Again I find a quote by Marta and Raquel to be instructive: “Proper activism must occur in designated spaces, never demanding more power than the powerful are willing to give up.” It is clear to me that by proper activism you as the “powerful musician” designate it as the ability to perpetuate or folklorize the political music of our ancestors. Perpetuating culture while representing music and dance as benign erased the historical significance, the historical memory that is necessary to truly represent artistic modes of being. In this the reference to your band being “watered down” means it was removed of its political significance and relationship to power i.e. making it consumable. Raquel was trying to demonstrate this very thing in her piece. She was, after all, referencing a piece of music and in doing so was trying to remind us of the discriminatory nature under which these beautiful displays of culture (and even our very own beautiful racial diversity) come into being.  In this there is an owner, an expert: it is the people who control the state apparatus and your white skin makes you much more accessible in that right than others. In your descent argument you say that this is your culture so you aren’t in a sense appropriating it but you persist in ignoring the importance of phenotype in understandings of race. I remind you that increasingly, power is not about descent, it’s about pigmentation. In this, you should recognize that you are a “white man.” In the homelands and even in our ethnic communities, the most powerful and the most beautiful still fit within the ideology of blanqueamineto. “…defined as the gradual ‘purging’ of black features from the general population…not only encourages, but also enables dominant, romantic representations of black communities as remnants of a by-gone era” (Godreau 284).  In conclusion Justin, the intention of this article has been a plea for you to reflect on yourself and your position in the silencing of others. My citations come from “Changing Space, Making Race: Distance, Nostalgia, and the Folklorization of Blackness in Puerto Rico” (you can find it online in the Identities journal Volume 9, 281-304, 2002) I’ve got many more citations if you’d like just email me at mlroasario@wesleyan.edu."
"Center for Continuing Studies launches its second semester","2005-02-11","by Eric Lach, Contributing Writer","The Center for Continuing Studies, which offers non-credit classes in the liberal arts to community members, alumni, and parents of students, held a reception at Broad Street Books Monday night to celebrate its first completed semester. As a result of the success of the five courses the center ran in the fall, it plans to offer five courses for the spring semester. A digital print class, one of these spring classes, had only two spots left after the first day of registration. “The center is a very positive advantage that Middletown residents have because of Wesleyan,” said Middletown Mayor Domenique S. Thornton, at the reception. “It expands horizons, adds depth to people’s lives and understanding, and opens up new interests and careers.”  According to the Mayor, city employees get a reduction in tuition from Wesleyan and a reimbursement from the city as an incentive to take advantage of the center.  Balloons, a catered spread, wine, and a podium adorned what normally is Broad Street’s magazine section for the event, converting the space into a cozy reception area. The crowd of 40 people in attendance was a mix of Wesleyan staff, town officials, and former and future students of the program. “It was nice to see the different people who came,” said Penny Robinar, a Middletown resident who took “History of the Book” last semester. “It didn’t matter who you were or where you were from.”  Most in attendance agreed that the Center for Continuing Studies is a great addition to Middletown and hope that the program will become a permanent fixture in the community.  “Our goal for enrollment last semester was 50, and we ended up having 58 students,” said Dr. Lori Hunter-Union, Associate Dean of Continuing Studies and Director of the Graduate Liberal Studies Program. “This semester the program is looking to expand to 75 students.” Residents who had taken some of the classes offered spoke highly of their courses and professors.  “It was thrilling,” Robinar said. “It gave me a peek at what Wesleyan has to offer. We kept [the professor] late with questions every time. We wanted her to stay.” Although Wesleyan has offered continuing studies courses for credit in the past, with programs like PIMS, upward bound, and the GLSP, the Center for Continuing Studies fills some of the gaps left by the other programs. “[The center] allows for learning just for the fun of it,” Hunter-Union said.  “These courses aren’t as expensive as the for-credit courses given in the past,” said Barbara Arafeh, a Middletown resident who is enrolled for spring classes. “It will help to refresh on the latest findings [in infant development],” Arafeh said. She already has a Masters degree and runs a kindermusik program, but promotes the importance of continuing one’s education.  “This is a great start [for the center], but there is still growing to do,” said Billy Weitzer, Dean of Continuing Studies and Senior Associate Provost. In the future, Weitzer hopes that the center can develop a closer connection with Wesleyan in which films, lectures, and concerts can be cosponsored. According to Weitzer, the goal of the center is to expand and enrich the Wesleyan community. “It’s great that [the center] links town and gown, and that it is unidirectional,” Weitzer said. “Middletown has a lot to teach Wesleyan.”"
"For V-Day needs, head to Tina’s","2005-02-11","by Laura Brown, Assistant News Editor","In the need of a Valentine’s gift for someone? Tina’s Fine Lingerie, located on Main Street provides options to fit the occasion. The store includes a wide variety of lingerie, with everything from bras and panties to hosiery and even bustiers. They also offer costumes, novelties, dresses, gowns and an impressive swimwear collection.  According to Tina Lun, the store’s owner, Tina’s Fine Lingerie offers the largest collection of fine and sexy lingerie and the best Venus Swimwear in Connecticut. Lun said that Valentine’s Day and Christmas are the two busiest times for the store. While the vast majority of customers during the year are women, men make up about half of the clientele around Christmas and 75 percent of the clientele around Valentine’s Day. “Right now a lot of people request the heart bustier,” said employee Amanda Matthews, referring to the bustier displayed in the Main Street window. “Basically, anything red sells really well around this time. A lot of people are looking for baby dolls and corsets. Around Valentine’s Day is also when people buy the more naughty gifts.” “Naughty gifts” include a variety of sex toys, lubricants, videos, games and body jewelry. Whips are hot items right now, although surprisingly not the furry love cuffs,  Matthews said.   Tina’s has had good relations with Wesleyan students since it opened, and has employed students in the past. Last year Lun said she would have accepted points at her store had the Wesleyan points system used in Middletown restaurants and businesses been willing to include her store. Business from students is never very big, she said; most customers are over 20, according to Lun. Wesleyan students, however, do make up a niche group of customers.  According to Janene Podesta ’05, the store’s merchandise offers real potential for student business. “Tina is really busy right now,”  Matthews said. “This is always a busy time for us…She just has a lot to do.” “During Halloween, we get a lot of Wesleyan students in here,” Lun said. “With costumes they usually don’t buy the whole outfit, but we sell a lot of fishnet stockings.”   In addition, Lun does much of her own photography for the store’s website, Tinasfinelingerie.com. It features an online catalogue with shipping all across the US along with information on how to host your own lingerie “home party.” Tina’s Fine Lingerie is normally open Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. until 6 p.m., Saturdays 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and is closed on Sundays. They will have extended hours this week, staying open until 8 p.m. until   Valentine’s Day."
"In the age of Facebook, students have few secrets","2005-04-15","by Dan Bobkoff, Executive Editor","When Susannah Fox ’92 attended Wesleyan, she often spent her Wednesday nights at “Blues and Brews,” a weekly house party held by Eric Halperin ’92 and his friends. On one of these Wednesdays—Robert Cray playing in the background—Fox and Halperin met by the keg and hit it off. The trouble was, after that night, Eric disappeared.   “I would scour the library and would have to walk all around campus, looking, trying to find him,” Fox said. Lucky for them, they did find each other, and eventually married in 1998. But, she wonders if it would have been easier to get to know him if they were in college today.  “I would never have called and neither would he for a ‘date,” she said. “If I had just gotten his screen name or email, our impression is that it would have been so much easier to connect.”  That’s probably true. Today’s students can contact each other with cellphones, e-mail, text messaging, Instant Messenger and the most recent addition, Thefacebook.com (known to most as “Facebook”). These only became widely available in the last decade.  Facebook’s adoption among students has been astounding, with over 2.2 million users at 496 colleges and growing. There are 2,985 users at Wesleyan, including students, alumni, faculty, and staff. Anyone with a valid Wesleyan email address can create an account and profile on the site. Given that level of acceptance, it suggests that students are comfortable forfeiting their personal information for the social gains the site affords. But are they putting themselves at risk? For the uninitiated, Facebook is a social networking website where students post profiles with photographs of themselves, and a wide range of information from cellphone numbers, addresses, Instant Messenger screen names, to sexual orientation, whether they’re in a relationship or not (and if so, with whom), to favorite movies, music, quotes, and a free response section. Some students will also post links to online photo albums and diaries that might contain pictures of underage drinking and the students’ innermost thoughts. The site also displays a list of a user’s friends and lets those friends leave public comments on your profile.  The site, then, is helping to change the ways students forge friendships and relationships, and is able to do so because of students’ willingness to post copious amounts of personal information for anyone in the school community to see. Now, students walk around campus knowing information about strangers, acquaintances, and crushes without ever having to interact with them.  And that information can be addictive.  “I once tried to go a day without signing onto Facebook and failed miserably,” said self-described Facebook addict Elissa Gross ’08. “I went until 8 o’clock at night.” The site is fun, useful, and a great procrastination tool, but some see it as part of a shift in how we interact with one another.  “We’re coming from a tradition going back tens of thousands of years in which when people met, they didn’t know anything about each other, or just [knew] what a friend told them,” said Paul Levinson, Professor and Chair of Media Studies at Fordham University, and the author of “Digital McLuhan: A Guide to the Information Millennium.”  “What I think something like the Facebook does is that it gives everyone a little dossier, and it does profoundly change the rules of engagement when they do meet,” he said. “It obsolesces small talk.” Most students I spoke with did not believe they were sacrificing safety by being on the site.  “I figure that with the internet, you can find any information you’re looking for,” said Ruby Ross ’08, whose Facebook profile lists Flamenco dance and chocolate soymilk as interests.   Nor is Allison Wilcox ’07 particularly worried about people using her information maliciously.  “It’s a small enough campus that if you want to stalk someone, you don’t need Facebook to do it,” she said.  Students’ laissez-faire attitude toward privacy on the site troubles Parry Aftab, an internet privacy and security lawyer and executive director of WiredSafety.org. She said students feel too secure on Facebook. When presenting themselves online, students are inclined to assume that only savory students will be checking their information and contacting them.  “There’s a disconnect between the construction of who’s reading your post and the reality,” she said. “The good people are not necessarily who are reading it.” Aftab, who uses teen and collegiate volunteers to help stay abreast of net trends, says her organization often receives word of abuses from Facebook users.  “We get reports all the time of cyberstalking and harassment,” she said. “A lot of them become sexual very quickly.” Aftab also cites instances of identity theft and cyberstalking among Facebook users.  However, Chris Hughes, a spokesman for Thefacebook.com, said that the site rarely receives reports of stalking or other harassment.  “Most complaints about ‘stalking’ simply require a readjustment of a user’s privacy settings and a warning message sent to the user accused of inappropriate behavior,” he said. “We think our users are pretty savvy about what information they give out to their peers.” No one I spoke with knew of any illicit behavior through Facebook at Wesleyan.  Fox, who is now associate director of the Pew Internet & American Life Project, a nonprofit organization that studies how the internet affects areas of our lives, says that most people don’t understand the implications of their actions on the internet.  “They love the convenience [of the internet],” she said. “For the most part, nothing bad has happened to them so they continue to do these high-trust activities.”  Her colleague, Steve Jones, a senior research fellow at Pew Internet, and a professor of communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said that many of his students didn’t consider the consequences of their online profiles until after they put them online.  “Facebook seems safer because it’s restricted to your own campus,” he said.  Jones warns, however, that there could always be unexpected consequences.  “Let’s say you put something in your profile about how you’re a real party animal, and 20 years later, you’re running for political office and someone discovers it,” he said. “On the other hand, I don’t think everything everyone puts up there is true.” True or not, there are other emerging consequences for posting a risqué Facebook profile.  University of Wisconsin-Madison freshman Jill Klosterman discovered that campus employers were perusing the profiles of potential employees, comparing their online self-portrayals to their resumes.  “I was told by a [Wisconsin Union] employee that ensuring that my Facebook profile was employer-safe was ‘strongly advised,” she said.  Jones likens employers using Facebook to basing hiring decisions on hearsay. It seems clear, though, the days of students seeing the site as purely their domain may be numbered.   At Yale, for instance, professors have begun creating their own profiles, often at the insistence of students who are enamored with a particular professor.  The reaction to professors joining Facebook there seem to be mostly warm, according to Yale Daily News writer and freshman Josh Duboff, who wrote an article about the phenomenon.  “Most people seem to think that there’s nothing on their Facebook profiles that is so private that they are worried about faculty members seeing it,” Duboff said. “The professors seem to have an amusing attitude toward the whole thing.”  About 30 Yale professors have joined. At Wesleyan, a quick search didn’t turn up any active faculty, but that could quickly change. At the University of Iowa, even the school’s president is on the site now. Facebook may shift to become an online reflection of the physical school community.  Levinson, who plans to join the site at Fordham soon, is unsure how this evolving community will take shape.  “It could bring faculty and students together, but it could also undermine some of the advantages and camaraderie students now have with it,” he said.   He points to sexual preferences as one such trait students might not want professors to view. Facebook does offer privacy preferences that allow students to tailor who sees aspects of their profiles, however.  “I think most of our users are intelligent enough to know that any information they’re posting to a site for their college will, in fact, be seen by other members of their collegiate community,” Hughes said.  Aftab, who actually likes Facebook, said students should just be prudent about what they post.  “You shouldn’t use it as a diary,” she said. Aftab warns that students should also avoid being sexually provocative, or taking strong political or other opinions “that are going to evoke a strong reaction from other people. Otherwise you’re putting a target on your back,” she said.  Risky or not, Facebook’s popularity is a direct result of students’ willingness to forgo privacy to belong to a community. Perhaps the most profound result of the rise of Facebook is that it demonstrates a great many of us do not fear incursions on our privacy, but rather want to be found. Many, overtly or not, hope people are searching for their profiles and finding them interesting. Otherwise, why belong to the site at all? Or, as Alan Yaspan ’08 responded when asked if he’d ever been stalked online, “I could use an ego boost.” “I think pretty much everyone that posts all this information wants people to contact them,” said Dan Stillman ’04. “They just don’t want to seem too eager about it. Stillman is the co-creator of WesMatch, a competitor to Thefacebook.com that allows users to find students who are compatible with them by filling out a questionnaire and then checking a list of whose answers most closely resemble their own.  The etiquette of these technologies is still developing. Facebook, WesMatch, and the internet as a whole, have legitimized researching our acquaintances, classmates, and crushes.  ”Thanks largely to Google and the Web in general, there’s an expectation today that, if you want to find out information about a person, you’ll be able to just load up a web browser and type in a name,“ Stillman said. This expectation is recent, however. When he was a freshman, people were surprised if he knew about their backgrounds before they spoke. ”Today, I think many people are surprised if someone hasn’t looked them up,“ he said.  Meeting someone they had researched on the web, some students find themselves asking questions they already know the answer to. It’s not quite socially acceptable to admit you’ve been researching the person. There is a disconnect between the acceptability of online snooping and the permissibility of using that information.  Like many students I spoke with, Ross said this has happened to her when meeting friends of friends she had looked up.  ”I had to pretend my ignorance,“ she said.  Matt Gregory ’07 found himself unexpectedly unnerved when he walked into a friend’s room and found her looking at his profile.  ”She was doing it to get contact info, but it still made me feel uncomfortable,“ he said. ”I felt that was something she could have gotten in a more personal manner.“  Indeed, finding friends has become akin to shopping online. You can see customer reviews (what someone’s friends have added to a profile), and even add or cancel a relationship with the push of a button. In the information age, we expect to do the same kind of research on a potential girlfriend or boyfriend as we would a new toaster.  Levinson thinks the site is helping students find each other more efficiently.  ”The fact is, on the one hand humans have a lot of basic similarities, but when you get beyond that, there is a myriad of very disparate interests,“ he said. ”By making this information available, it encourages people to meet people who are interested in the same things you are.“ Gross said the site makes her and others gutsier.  ”I think college students like Facebook because, like alcohol, it really lowers your inhibitions and timidity in terms of posting or messaging things you would never say in real life,“ she said. Gross said that, among her friends, it’s impressive to get with someone who chose not to be on the site.  ”It’s like a challenge now, trying to find someone who’s so mysterious and elusive that they would avoid this newfound cult,“ she said.  Anonymity is not just hard to attain on campus now, it is rarely desired, either. Those students who choose to avoid Facebook, won’t sign on Instant Messenger, and don’t have a cellphone, are seen as modern day Luddites, quietly disrupting the new social order. Many students expect others to be reachable and researchable anytime of day from anywhere. And, with that, come new risks and rewards.  Privacy, already scarce on a campus as small as this one, is almost extinct, but that’s just how students like it.  As Yaspan puts it, ”Nowadays, it seems like you have to have some presence in cyberspace to be anybody at all.“"
"Wesleyan draws line between High Rise and Traverse Square","2005-09-20","by Alexandra Early,","This morning I woke up too early, as I do every morning because of the light filtering through the slits between my window shades. I pulled up the shades and admired the view before me. To the left, the elementary school turned condominium on College St. and the immense office building on Court St. The red awning of Broad Street Books and opposite it, the dark maroon, oddly shaped government subsidized elderly home. The clock tower of the Middletown police station, and the scattered spires of various churches and temples. In the distance, the grayish blue bridge which passes into the hills of Portland, and patches of the snaking Connecticut River. And directly below my eighth floor High Rise window, the projects of Traverse Square. Earlier, I heard the shouts of children playing, but when I looked down what caught my eye was a group of men shoveling dirt from a muddy black truck into the newly blocked off staircase that once physically connected Wesleyan students and Middletown’s poor. One of Low Rise’s many staircases, these four steps were blocked off with stark white cement by the time this year’s generation of Low and High Risers moved in. The wall was a disturbingly clear expression of the Administration’s attitude toward the residents of Traverse Square. It told them to stay on their side and us to stay on ours. And now the warning is covered with dirt, soon to be replaced by a flower garden for the benefit of visiting prefrosh and their parents. Now it is as if there never was a staircase on which students could so easily break out of the much-maligned Wesleyan bubble and meet their Traverse Square neighbors. The new protocol is to ignore their existence (but always remember to cross the street when we reach their block, especially if it’s at night!) Because all we know about them is what we read in the Argus or in Public Safety Announcements. They jump us and mug us when we are coming home drunk from a party. Or if we live close by, we hear them some nights hanging out on their stoops. We try to drown out their laughing and shouting with the classical music emanating from our laptops so we can finish our readings about the history of colonialism or the theory of racism. Wesleyan had made some laudable efforts to build a community that integrates town and gown. Some Wesleyan students patronize Middletown stores, volunteer in the North End, teach ESL to Wesleyan employees or play with kids at local after-school programs, like the one at Traverse Square. But what if the University just threw a block party, or a cookout, like normal neighbors do when they want to get to know each other? At the very least, this would show Traverse Square residents that Wesleyan students want to be good neighbors. We could talk to and learn first hand about people who appear to be frighteningly different than us. Next time when we pass after class, we would have a reason to wave or stop and say hello, instead of tensing up, walking faster and looking straight ahead. And maybe this would begin to repair some of the damage done by years of building walls and sending out warnings. Wesleyan University prides itself on creating students who are inquisitive, knowledgeable and conscientious, students who contribute to their communities. But what model do we have to follow? We are instructed to read extensively about the problems of poor people and minorities, and strive in think tanks and nonprofits to fix their problems, asking once in a while for their input. But we should not live near them. We should not talk to them. We should stay on our side of the wall."
"Mayor greets voters before upcoming election","2005-10-07","by Matt DiBlasi, News Editor","Mayor Domenique Thornton and Democratic candidates for various councils, commissions and boards talked with the Middletown community Thursday Evening at Luce Restaurant. The meet-and-greet event was organized by Middletown’s Young Democrats and was well attended by voters and local high school students. “It’s inspiring, as a lifelong Democrat, to see the participation of young people,” said Mayor Thornton at the event. “It is only through young voters that our democracy can work. If you don’t participate in the process, you can’t complain about the outcome.” The mayor discussed issues that have been important to her during her tenure as mayor, citing the environmental and economic development that has taken place over the last eight years in Middletown, particularly the increase in retail and dining in the downtown area. “More restaurants [and stores] are interested in coming downtown,” she said. Despite the economic growth, the number one issue for Thornton has always been education. She began her political career by campaigning to support educational funding and has played a key role in moving the new high school building project forward. Improving the relationship between the University and the town has always been an important issue as well. “I promoted projects such as Wesleyan’s Long Lane school acquisition, the Inn, and the Green Street Arts Center,” Thornton said. “I plan to continue a very strong [town-gown] relationship in the future.” However, a non-University educational issue is taking center stage in the upcoming election. “The construction of the new high school is the number one issue,” said Dan Filer ’78, who is running for a seat on the Board of Education. “We have the right site and the right people now and we need to proceed and build it. It’s going to be state-of-the-art.” Thornton, who will oppose Republican candidate Sebastian Giuliano in the Nov. 8 election, was arrested on Sept. 14, but cleared of a DUI charge and a traffic violation Sept. 21 in Middletown Superior Court. Her blood-alcohol content was determined to be .018, well below .08, the legal limit in Connecticut. In addition, a toxicology test on a urine sample showed that there was no medication in her body that could have been dangerous in combination with the glass of red wine she had with dinner on the night of the arrest.  According to police, Thornton failed a field sobriety test after being pulled over, but she explained to several of the voters at the meet and greet that she has a spine curvature in addition to other ailments, including a sprained ankle at the time the test was administered. The overwhelming sentiment of the present members of the Democratic Party was that the mayor, who was followed for three miles before being pulled over, may have been unfairly targeted because of the upcoming election. Last year, Thornton defeated Giuliano by just 232 votes, but she has been working hard to ensure another victory. “I’ve been going door-to-door,” Thornton said. “I started Aug. 8. I’m personally asking voters to come out and vote because every vote counts. I need the support to continue making progress. I hope people realize that it will come to a screeching halt unless we keep the Democrats in office.”"
"Sutton and Trio play benefit for arts center in Crowell","2005-11-11","by Emily Einhorn, Assistant Arts Editor","As Tierney Sutton ’86 sang the words “blue skies smiling on me,” sighs could be heard from the audience and smiles seen. Happiness permeated last Friday night’s benefit performance for the Green Street Arts Center (GSAC) by Tierney Sutton and Trio.  An early event of Homecoming weekend, Tierney Sutton’s concert served as a medium to strengthen Wesleyan’s connections to the art center, which was co-founded by the University and Middletown community members last spring. Sutton gave the concert as a gift to the center to raise money and publicity. Sutton strutted onto the stage in a stunning red evening gown, her three band members dressed in black behind her. The show was completely sold out and those without tickets were turned away. A buzz of excitement and energy could be heard throughout the audience as people reconnected with old friends, faculty, and students. An eclectic mix of benefactors, Wesleyan families, students lucky enough to get one of the 25 free student tickets, people associated with the Green Street Arts Center, and lovers of good jazz filled Crowell Concert Hall to the max.  Ricardo Morris, the director of the GSAC, introduced Sutton, described services of the GSAC and thanked Wesleyan and Sutton for their support and generosity. Over fifty students have volunteered time at the GSAC since its opening in January 2005. “Wesleyan students share their gifts, talents, and enthusiasm for life,” Morris said.  Sutton jumped into stunning vocal scales and her band slowly entered in behind her. Sutton’s band has been together for twelve years and has recorded seven CDs. Her band includes Kevin Axt on bass, Ray Brinker on drums, and Christian Jacob on piano. The group played many songs from their new live album and some old favorites. One crowd pleaser was an arrangement on an old Irvin Berlin song that Sutton promised would take the audience “on a band adventure ride.”  Sutton constantly mentioned how talented her band members are and showcased them often during the songs. The last song of her first set, a rearrangement of “Ding, Dong, the Witch is Dead” highlighted all three of her band members while leaving room for acrobatic vocals. Sutton sang quickly, clearly, and beautifully through the quick dramatic changes in speed and intensity throughout the song. Throughout the night Sutton spoke of her time at Wesleyan, which she credits with her decision to become a jazz singer—a decision catalyzed when she saw jazz great Betty Carter sing on Crowell’s stage. She also described teachers who inspired and aided her love and appreciation of music. “By the time I graduated from Wesleyan with a degree in Russian literature I knew I wanted to be a jazz singer,” Sutton said, drawing laughs. Sutton then sang “The Girl from Ipanema” in Russian.  “This is the most expensive eight bars in music history,” she said. “When my father is in the audience he weeps.” The second set of the night, which included songs by Cole Porter, Johnny Mandel, and Jimmy Rowles, proved to be just as beautiful as the first. The song “Wouldn’t it be Lovely” from the musical “My Fair Lady” was a crowd pleaser that allowed Sutton to use her full vocal range.  The night ended with two standing ovations and an encore performance of the Bill Evans song “We Will Meet Again,” dedicated to a friend her band recently lost and to her Wesleyan family and friends. “It is wonderful to be back in this space that changed my life,” Sutton said. “It was a successful fund-raiser for the Green Street Art Center,” said Dean of the College Maria Cruz-Saco. “The GSAC is a powerful concept that Wesleyan fully and enthusiastically supports. Tierney Sutton’s generosity is creating a model relationship for others to follow.” Lillian Siegel ’08 said that Sutton was a particularly good choice for parents weekend. “My dad laughed when she said she sympathizes with parents who are paying way too much for their children to go here who in the end can’t do anything useful with their major,” Siegel said. “It was inspiring to hear how much of the world was opened to her when she came to Wesleyan.”"
"WSA should be worthwhile","2006-02-07","by Bea Lake,","Dear Wesleyan Student Assembly, The following is a response to your recent all-campus email, entitled “money, dining, pimpology, and more…..” In the last year, your organization has consistently managed to disappoint me, as a Wesleyan student and one of your voting constituents. The WSA’s one memorable foray into campus activism last semester was a poorly organized, inaccurately advertised, ill-conceived, unhelpful and condescending lesson on “how to be activists” in which the facilitator flatly rejected students’ requests to discuss strategy and goals. Understandably, this prompted a substantial portion of the attendees to leave soon thereafter. While halfheartedly trying to shape us into activists of your specifications, you have apparently let issues such as administrative transparency, student power in decision making, gender neutral housing, and a glut of other issues fall by the wayside. This, despite the fact that these issues were raised by hundreds of students, through direct and unmediated action, just last year, and the fact that gender neutral housing, in particular, received overwhelming support in a student referendum with the largest voter turnout in history. It may well be that somewhere in your subcommittees, these issues are still being addressed, but we don’t hear about that. Instead, you jokingly threaten to curtail dining options, rather than perhaps discussing Wesleyan’s plans with regard to Aramark (and other dining contractors, with highly variable labor relations histories) as the new campus center approaches completion. You provide University Relations with a platform to push for more student fundraising. This takes the place of tracking where that funding goes,  critically examining how the university disburses those funds, or even merely keeping in mind that, as the Wesleyan Student Assembly, your role is to represent student interests, not the interests of the Office of University Relations and the Annual Fund. You pitch a vacant (and apparently unelected) WSA position by reaching out to people who “like to be in charge” rather than, once again, remaining cognizant of your duty to represent the student body, not to lead it or take charge of it. With that sort of attitude towards student government, it’s little wonder that you give no time or space to a critical examination of your organization’s decision-making power and democratic potential within the structure of this university. It’s apparently much easier, and much more fun, to use student representation for what’s really important: creating an aloof club of “the coolest people on campus.” And lastly, rather than increasing allocations for student groups, or allocating more resources to any number of student causes which could increase student engagement, foster community, and promote action and involvement in our school and our world, you provide us with a music service which can not only provide us with pop glorification of misogyny to our heart’s content, but is in fact the perfect thing for “getting cruncked, laid, or chilling to this weekend and this semester.” For lack of any other indication, I’ll assume you take these three activities to be the full range of acceptable student behavior. Maybe you got this service for free, and it doesn’t come out of funding that would otherwise be available through the SBC for activities, groups, and projects. If so, it’s hardly worth congratulating yourself on for such a substantial part of your token correspondence with the student body. And in the future, you might want to decide whether the butt of your joke is A: a neatly produced stereotyped image of sexist black hypermasculinity, or B: the exploitation of women in sex work, before you start laughing. Now, it’s entirely possible that this is all terribly unfair, that you are diligently at work at all the issues students have been hammering you over the head with for years. If so, please tell us about it, show some results, and fire your PR rep. Because if you’re doing anything worthwhile, we’re certainly never hearing about it. Sincerely, Bea Lake"
"More Arabic classes necessary","2006-02-24","by Luke Schleusener,","During the Cold War, Eastern European immigrants provided critical language skills that allowed the U.S. to defeat the Warsaw Pact. In the years since 9/11, Arab-Americans have found it difficult to offer their services to the government, which has security concerns. The only other source of Arabic speakers is from the few Arabic language programs at American universities. Since 2001, grants from the Departments of State, Education, and Defense for the teaching Arabic have exploded. Liberal arts colleges such as Dartmouth, Amherst, and Williams have taken advantage of this to establish well-funded programs. Wesleyan has not.  During the fall of 2003, Wesleyan finally began its Arabic program. As a Less Commonly Taught Language, it was only offered three times a week for fifty minutes, taught by a Sudanese immigrant. In order to have a second year, students had to file forms to get a Self-Instructed Language Program, meeting twice a week, with no resources. Before the “third year” of the program, the remaining students went abroad, or spent the summer relearning the language. At the start of this year, Wesleyan added a crippled second year of Arabic, modeled on the first—three times a week, fifty minutes—and even added a TA who had spent time in Egypt.  Although third-year Arabic would have been larger than third year German or Korean, no such class was created, despite significant student interest and investment. Instead, history professor Bruce Masters, fluent in Standard and Colloquial Arabic, taught a student forum for fifty minutes once a week. On a scale of one to five, the State Department rates Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese as fives: the most difficult for native English speakers to learn. Chinese and Japanese have classes every day, as well as mandatory time in the language lab and TA sessions.  Wesleyan has a long tradition of political activism in the U.S. and world community. The choices of the current administration have positioned the United States and the rest of the world to be engaged in a global war on terror for decades; the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan have no end in sight; NATO may take up a role in the Sudan. Given the prolonged engagement in the Arab world, it is critical that the United States develop Arabic-speaking personnel; Arabic messages on the 10th of September, 2001 indicated what was to happen the following day, but were not translated until September 12.  At a time when the U.S. has been engaged in torture and other ill-conceived adventures abroad, there can be no doubt that as citizens of the United States, and as members of the global community, Wesleyan students should have access to the resources that will let them make a difference. Interest at Arabic at Wesleyan is high; it is time for the resources committed to it to match that interest."
"Film Commentary: Women in Hollywood","2006-04-28","by Matt Connolly, Assistant Arts","Make the trip to Destinta and see “Friends with Money.” A witty and wise study of friendship and class in elite Los Angeles, this bittersweet new comedy starring Jennifer Aniston, Joan Cusack, Catherine Keener, and Frances McDormand is simply terrific. As the artery-clogging onslaught of greasy summer blockbusters grows closer by the day, this perfectly tossed salad of a movie, light yet surprisingly filling, provides a refreshing antithesis. It also provides the most intriguingly implicit commentary on the state of women in Hollywood in some time. If “Friends with Money” existed within a social vacuum, it would still be worth seeing for its mercurial mix of satiric detail, evocative grace notes, and note-perfect performances by four talented and graceful actresses. But, in our paparazzi-saturated culture, celebrity persona inevitably seeps into both casting choices and audience reactions. Writer/director Nicole Holofcener’s decision to cast Aniston as a pot-smoking, rudderless maid and Cusack, McDormand, and Keener as her wealthy and successful friends succeeds within the context of her film due to the vanity-free performances she gets from her quartet of actresses. Her skill as a chronicler of love, sex, aging, and other mid-life adventures amongst women over thirty-five detaches the audience from reality and allows us to savor the jewel-like moments of humor and heartbreak. View the film outside of this context and the ironies are hard to deny. In reality, Jennifer Aniston’s angular face will be plastered on more magazines this year than Cusack, McDormand, and Keener’s will in a decade. In reality, the former “Friends” star has had her love life dissected for the last year and a half by a voracious tabloid machine; no one seems to be checking up on McDormand’s marriage to Joel Coen with any degree of frequency. To see Aniston scrubbing toilets while Cusack shops for $80 children’s sneakers and Keener oversees an addition on her suburban palace is to acknowledge that Aniston is the real Hollywood royalty, while the other three are beloved “character actresses.” In mainstream Hollywood, McDormand plays the mom, not the romantic lead. Keener supplies the wiseacre jokes, not the second half of a romantic duo (“The 40 Year Old Virgin” notwithstanding). Cusack is the ditz, not the heroine. “Character actresses” (read: not a size 0) of “a certain age” (read: over 40) don’t get the leads; they’re too “quirky.” Aniston, bless her heart, does not fit the vacuous bimbo-babe model that acts as the Hollywood baseline. Taking roles like films like “Friends with Money” and Miguel Artera’s “The Good Girl” reflects a sincere, straining desire to be remembered as more than just Rachel Green, a longing so palpable it’s almost touching. And here, freed from both sitcom shtick and the self-consciously glum aimlessness of “The Good Girl”, she gives a sweet and salty performance of admirable understatement. That being said, she is undeniably buoyed by her co-stars, so often forgotten by the Hollywood mainstream for the mistake of aging gracefully rather than Botox-ing themselves into frozen-faced oblivion. Aniston’s character, Olivia, may be cleaning up the stains here. Audience members can’t help but be aware, however, that Jennifer Aniston, burgeoning movie star and formerly married to one-half of Brangelina, will be seen not two months later in “The Break-Up”, a potential mainstream smash. And where will Cusack (43) or Keener (46) or McDormand (48) be? Working, no doubt; but with little hope of getting the kind of lead roles in mainstream Hollywood films that Aniston (37) has at her finger tips. There are no easy solutions to the frustrating double standards currently at work in Hollywood. Look no further than the continual casting of such graying former heartthrobs as Richard Gere in romantic leads for proof. However, there is hope to be taken from films like “Friends with Money”, and particularly from directors like Nicole Holofcener. Given the aforementioned outside perspective audiences bring into her film, Holofcener (herself in her mid 40s) could have taken the opportunity to make a loud and obvious statement about gender inequality in the film world. Instead, she celebrates all the women on screen, with a generous and watchful eye whose blunt honesty emanates from a place of intelligent warmth. “Friends with Money” has very little in the way of plot momentum; Roger Ebert, in a recent two-star review, deemed the film “more of an idea than a story.” Yet it’s this very shapelessness that allows the audience to bask in the glow of Holofcener’s multi-faceted on-screen creations, women of substance and shortfalls and strength. Whatever they’re standing in the off-screen world, all four actresses in “Friends with Money” are on equal creative footing.  This personal, candid, and unapologetically feminine cinematic perspective of character over plot mechanics, minor-key reflection over earth-shattering revelation, may just be the best way to combat the gender and age bias at work in mainstream filmmaking. Holofcener’s work, unfortunately, reaches a limited number of people. In the wake of indie hit “Lost in Translation”, though, Sofia Coppola seems primed to expose a larger audience to her poetic, free-flowing vision of lost souls adrift in a world both bewildering and exhilarating. Her “Marie Antoinette” plays in competition at Cannes next month and opens in October. And Catherine Hardwicke, who exploded out of the gate in 2003 with her scalding teen-girl drama “Thirteen”, returns this December with “Nativity”, a picture of the life of the Virgin Mary before Jesus. And anyone who attempts to peg her, or any of these directors, as “for chicks only” needs only to see Hardwicke’s “Lords of Dogtown”, an underrated film that shows male skateboarders as fractious and insecure as any stereotypical “mean girl” clique. In a perfect world, one could watch a film like “Friends with Money” and not associate casting with the hypocrisy of the current Hollywood system, and directors like Holofcener may yet change this. Until that day comes, however, the sight of Jennifer Aniston in a maid’s outfit and Frances McDormand in designer gowns cannot help but make you think: in Hollywood’s eyes, the roles are reversed."
"The past, present, and future of the presidency…","2006-05-05","by ,","President Bennet’s announcement that he will step down after the 2006-2007 school year has inevitably brought to mind everything he has accomplished here since 1995, for better and for worse. As the nationwide search for his replacement is set to begin, we ask those in charge of selecting a new president to learn from Bennet’s time as president and, most importantly, actually listen to and value student input. In his years here, Bennet has proved to be an incredibly successful fundraiser. Alumni donations have increased exponentially and, under his leadership, the University has undertaken a massive strategic plan. For the most part, things are going as planned. The new Usdan University Center, set to open in Fall 2007, is taking shape. New buildings and renovations have renewed the campus. Aside from the aesthetically and functionally questionable Zelnick Pavilion, these changes are welcome and much needed. While there is still work to do to improve town-gown relations, Bennet and his staff have worked hard to improve Middletown-Wesleyan relations, and he has been involved with various projects on Green Street and elsewhere. The perception of Wesleyan from outside the bubble has improved, but internally, more can and should be done to ensure that student voices play a role in big decisions, next year and in the years that follow. In that vein, a shortcoming of Bennet and his administration has been an unsettling tendency to ignore student opinion on important topics, such as chalking and gender neutral housing. The measures taken against fraternities on campus have been unnerving for current members, as well as angered alumni. Bennet and the administration need to be in consistent dialogue with the student body, through the WSA and other means. More frequent and regular meetings at which students can directly voice their concerns to the administration are a good idea as well. A university president needs to stay in constant contact with the students, which has not always been the case as of late. Administrative decisions often lack transparency, and are instead unnecessarily secretive. And when decisions are handed down, administrators shy away from explaining their thinking, apart from saying,“it’s been decided.” We would like to see this change. Nonetheless, we appreciate the great things Doug and Midge Bennet have done for this university. They are clearly dedicated to Wesleyan (and each other). We wish them the best whether they are here at Wesleyan, out sailing, or traveling the world visiting their grandchildren."
"Bennet announces retirement","2006-05-05","by Hilary Moss, News Editor","President Doug Bennet announced his retirement yesterday afternoon to a crowd of 500 gathered outside of North College. After serving for 12 years, Bennet will leave the University at the end of the 2006-2007 academic year. “Wesleyan is positioned well to engage new leadership, and the time is right for us to move ahead with the new phase of our lives,” Bennet said. “The work we did to define a Wesleyan education for the 21st century, to improve student aid, to add faculty, and to begin a process of campus renewal—all of these show that Wesleyan can make big decisions and act on them.” Bennet thanked alumni, faculty, staff, and students for their generosity. He also praised the support of alumni and parent volunteers, the faculty’s excellence, the quality of the administrative team, and the Board of Trustees’ strong leadership.  “Wesleyan is doing well both institutionally and in its daily pursuit of excellence,” he said. Dean of Natural Sciences and Mathematics Joe Bruno said he believes Bennet is choosing an appropriate time to retire. “I think Doug has thought carefully and realizes this is the optimal time to go,” Bruno said. “We’ve just come off a successful campaign and we’re thinking of another one in the near future. This leaves us time to have a new president in place.” Bruno also mentioned Bennet’s unabashed love for the University. “[Bennet’s] love for the place is clear any time you talk to him,” Bruno said. “He has a strong confidence in Wesleyan’s ability to get things done.” Chair of the Philosophy Department Professor Brian Fay pointed to Bennet’s ambitious on-campus construction program as one of his main achievements. “We hadn’t done buildings for years,” Fay said. “I think the strategic plan that was put into place in the mid-90s that served for the basics of his capital campaign was so successful in restoring to Wesleyan a sense of direction and purpose.” Fay also noted that Bennet repaired and improved town-gown relations. “Wesleyan was involved in the Middletown Inn and donated four million dollars to it,” Fay said. “There was also the Green Street Arts Center initiative, the service learning center, and the community partnerships building.” President Diana Chapman Walsh of Wellesley College, where Bennet serves on the Board of Trustees, commented on Bennet’s off-campus work. “We all look up to him and admire and appreciate him tremendously,” she said. “I got a chance to see firsthand the impact that he’s had [at Wesleyan]. He is a remarkable leader at Wesleyan and a spokesperson with a wide understanding of public policy issues and how change happens in world.” Walsh, who coincidentally announced her own retirement last Friday, described Bennet as someone who is “delightful and fun” with a great sense of humor.  Although many students will be sad to see Bennet leave, others question his performance at the University. Bea Lake ’06 said that Bennet hasn’t been a popular figure for a long time. “There’s nothing to say for sure that anything will necessarily get better with him gone and I don’t know there’s anything to say it will get worse,” Lake said. “He’s stood in the way of student causes and student voices, but I have no confidence that shuffling the person occupying that place will fix things. It’s more a structural problem. In part it’s his unwillingness to listen, but also it’s the nature of the position.” In his brief speech outside North College, Bennet described an educational community’s daily progress as ongoing and revolving on discovery, teaching, care, and respect. “The daily work shows who we really are,” he said. “It helps individual students define their values and learn the confidence that will empower them as change-makers. It reveals how well we are making good on the potential of our diversity.” Midge Bennet remarked that living on campus has been a happy time in the couple’s life together, and that she is looking forward to spending one more year at the University. “Doug and I will stay close to Wesleyan living nearby, here in Connecticut, and having more time to read and go sailing and visit with our grandchildren,” she said.  The Bennets have eight grandchildren, all six years old or younger, who live around the world, from Germany to California. “We hope to be invited to Wesleyan performances and lectures and sporting events and to lunch at the new Usdan Center, and to continue helping Wesleyan in any way we can,” Midge said. After his speech, President Bennet reflected on the accomplishments that stand out for him at Wesleyan, which include improved curriculum, town-gown relations, strategic planning, fundraising, and reducing reliance on the endowment. Chair of the Board of Trustees James van B. Dresser ’63 offered the Board’s congratulations and thanks, noting that the University has never been in better shape. According to Dresser, the Board will meet at the end of the month to discuss the future search for the new president.  “The Board will work alongside [the Bennets] to make this transition period not just smooth, but positive and memorable for all of us,” he said. “I promise I will keep the campus community fully informed about the process and that we will keep students, faculty, and staff fully involved.” According to trustee Michael McPherson, the Board has not yet looked into any candidates for the new president. “You want somebody of intellectual depth who understands what a place like Wesleyan is about,” McPherson said. “You always expect a new president to come with her or his new ideas, but a lot of things are already going well. We’ll be looking for a blend of innovation and continuity.” McPherson also stressed that student input will be part of the design of the search process. “I hope that the next president is younger and more in touch with the student body,” said Russell Berg ’07. “Bennet was always a little standoffish and a little aristocratic…the type that’s good at running a university, but his personality didn’t jibe with students.” Berg also noted that much of the administration has been replaced over the last school year. “There’s not much of a sense of continuity except maybe the Board of Trustees, the puppet masters pulling all of the strings,” Berg said. “They’re always there.”"
"Get involved now: take a stand against the genocide in Darfur","2006-09-22","by Will DiNovi,","In September 2004, the Bush administration declared the existence of genocide in the Darfur region of Western Sudan, where local rebel groups have been waging a rebellion against the Sudanese government.  Since that declaration two years ago, U.S. officials have paid only intermittent attention while an appalling record of human suffering has been amassed: over 200,000 dead and two million more driven from their homes by three years of attacks led by Sudanese troops and their proxy Arab militias. Though this crisis has been largely neglected by the world media throughout most of its tragic history, you may have noticed a recent influx of Darfur-related coverage in the news media.  You may have seen images of the over 30,000 people who assembled in Central Park this past Sunday to demand a U.N. peacekeeping force to protect the civilians of Darfur, an event that was part of demonstrations in 47 cities worldwide.  You may have noted the coverage of President Bush’s speech at the United Nations on Tuesday, where he appointed Andrew Natsios the U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan. You may have read about the African Union’s Wednesday decision to extend the mandate of its woefully understaffed Darfur peacekeeping force until the end of the year.  And you may have noted increased exposure as the toll of human suffering in Darfur has intensified in recent months, with the renewal of aerial bombing by the Sudanese government and the departure of many humanitarian aid groups due to security concerns, leaving hundreds of thousands of people without food and water. This recent flurry of news coverage reflects the critical juncture at which the international community finds itself in September 2006, a crucial tipping point at which there is an urgent need for action from both international policy makers and the ordinary citizens to whom they are accountable.  This week and next are crucial for continued engagement on this issue, both in terms of the politics unfolding in the UN General Assembly meetings and in light of the recent explosion of violence on the ground in Darfur.  \t Sudan’s president, Omar Hassan al-Bashir, is blocking the U.N. Security Council from sending some 20,000 peacekeepers to Darfur, saying that this would insult Sudan’s sovereignty. President Bush must call upon on all countries, including Sudan’s oil-dependent apologists China and Russia, to demand that Sudan drop its opposition. He should also press for broad international sanctions if Mr. Bashir does not quickly reverse his position.  As a New York Times Editorial on Wednesday explained, “Mr. Bush said the U.S. would take the lead in soliciting troops for the U.N. and recommended making NATO planners available to help draw up contingency plans for a possible forced entry.”  It is essential that President Bush and U.N. Ambassador John Bolton be held accountable to this promised course of action.  With this in mind, Wesleyan Students Taking Action Now: Darfur (WeSTAND) urges the Wesleyan community to consider some very simple but vital actions that can make a difference in making this urgent issue a top international priority for our policy makers:  -Call UN Ambassador Bolton and ask him to take a leadership position in putting a peacekeeping force on the ground in Darfur and holding Sudan accountable for its complicity in genocide. (212) 415-4000 -Call Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Rice is U.N. Ambassador John Bolton’s boss. Ask her to instruct Ambassador Bolton to make a U.N. peacekeeping deployment in Darfur his number one priority. (202) 647-4000.  -Participate in DarfurFast on Oct. 5. Join notable fasters Don Cheadle, Nicholas Kristof, Mia Farrow and more and pledge to give up a luxury item for a day and donate the proceeds. Visit www.timetoprotect.org for more details and related materials. -Attend a WeSTAND meeting. Meetings are at 10 PM on Mondays at the Bayit. We are engaged in a broad range of advocacy and fundraising efforts to seek a U.N. deployment in Darfur and offer support for the humanitarian aid agencies that are addressing the ongoing refugee crisis in the region.   For the past three years, the problem of genocide has been identified and the means have been available to achieve its resolution.  At the critical juncture at which we now find ourselves, we can no longer condemn the men, women and children of Darfur with our inaction.  We must hold our leaders and ourselves accountable to the vow that genocide will not continue on our watch."
"Homecoming/Family Weekend Preview","2006-10-20","by Emily Greenhouse, Staff Writer","The University is welcoming families and alumni to the campus for its 50th annual Homecoming/Family Weekend this Friday, Oct. 20 to Sunday, Oct. 22. This year’s event is particularly notable as it marks the University’s last with President Doug Bennet before his retirement and takes place during the 175th anniversary of the University’s institutional charter. The three-day affair will feature seminars, performances, athletic events, tours, tailgating, food, and social gatherings. On Saturday, the football, field hockey, women’s soccer, and men’s soccer teams will all face off against Little Three rival Amherst College, and men’s rugby will take on Central Connecticut State University. Other athletic events on Saturday include a baseball team golf tournament, various receptions and field dedications of Smith and Jackson Fields, and tailgating (weather permitting) on Andrus Field. Players and coaches from the 1966 football team will celebrate the 40th anniversary of their Little Three Championship season, and the 1991 men’s soccer team will also hold a reunion. Nearly 30 seminars will be held around campus this weekend, including “Studies of Consciousness: Linking Neuroscience and Philosophy,” “Keeping a Healthier Mind Through Solving Crosswords,” and “Becoming Global Citizens: Travel Notes from Wesleyan’s Jewish-Muslim Dialogue Journey to Istanbul and Jerusalem.” Other highlights of the Voices of Liberal Learning series include “The War on Terrorism: Are We Winning?” “When Sunlight Kills,” “Why Jews Laugh at Themselves,” and “Africa: Beyond Divestment to Engagement.” Readings at the Russell House will also commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Wesleyan Writers Conference.  Arts events will include the Fall Faculty Dance Concert, a benefit concert for the Green Street Arts Center featuring the Ebony Singers, an open rehearsal with the orchestra, a Celtic Music Workshop and Jam, and a Musica Viva Western art music recital. Additionally, the Assad Brothers will perform Brazilian guitar, and on Sunday several student a cappella groups will hold a recital. This Homecoming weekend holds a few once-in-a-lifetime events such as an “Irish Breakfast Fundraiser” in support of (and provided by) Middletown’s Brian O’Rourke, whose diner is still closed due to fire damage sustained in August.  On Saturday, community members will be invited to participate in an open conversation regarding the University’s next president. University graduates and staff will be holding presentations all week, covering activity and changes within the University community, and addressing undergraduate matters such as academics, studying abroad, and event planning. Interested parents will have the opportunity to attend class on Friday or Monday. Students will provide informational tours, and the admissions office will hold an information session and panel on Saturday for any prospective students. Special tours of Olin Memorial Library will be offered, and visitors will also have the chance to privately tour the University’s collections of art, archaeology and anthropology, East Asian work, and world musical instruments (which will be housed in the future Wesleyan University Museum). On Saturday, there will be open houses of the newly opened Wasch Center for Retired Faculty, the Career Resource Center, the Special Collections and Archives collection, the Latino Alumni Council, and Delta Kappa Epsilon. Offered for families are events such as Friday’s Shabbat services and dinner and the Wesleyan Christian Fellowship meeting, followed on Saturday by a Fellowship Homecoming Reception. There will also be a scavenger hunt celebrating the University’s 175th anniversary, a family swim with a swim team alum, a kids fair and festival on Foss Hill, and the annual legacy photograph. A historic Terquasquicentennial exhibition will be on display in the Zelnick pavilion. Other exhibitions include “Multiple Fascinations: Dutch and Flemish Prints from Bruegel to Rembrandt,” a collection of prints selected by Wesleyan students, and “Beijingren (Beijing people),” a collection of photographs by Derek Dudek. Additional events include a presentation of Race and Representation in Weimar Cinema, a community bike ride, a Connecticut River expedition, a Gamelan workshop, a symposium on innovation in corporate America, an astronomy presentation, and a ‘Day of Dance’ commemoration."
"Presidential search update","2006-11-14","by Mollie Laffin-Rose, News Editor","The Presidential Search Committee recently released its Position Specification, which summarizes the position of Presidency and details those ideal experiences and critical competencies for which the committee is searching in candidates.

"Open letter to President Bennet from Benjamin ’57","2006-12-01","by Martin Benjamin,","Dear Doug,   In your response to Talya Zemach-Bersin’s cri de coeur you quote a few words of the bubble-bunkered student’s neo-Marxist babble: “I am highlighting their (the Bennets) blatant insensitivity and denial of the systems and methods whereby those who are not white, male, heterosexual, and wealthy are marginalized and often met with resistance, in a world that is dominated by rich white heterosexual men, regardless of how hard they work.” (“They” are the marginalized, not “rich white heterosexual men.” Unsyntactically speaking, Zemach-Bersin is a repeat offender.)  You said that you were stung by her critique of your rendition of your career at the dinner you hosted for this year’s Wesleyan Service Career Fellows. Said rendition, I gather, attributed your success in the realm of public service less to talent and effort than to privilege  the privilege of being a rich, white, heterosexual man. Except that you said it tongue-in-cheek, which means that you didn’t mean it: You made it on your own, and not because of privilege, etc. Granted, allowed the lady (maybe she figures that you’re the exception that proves the rule). Nonetheless, you were chastised for “blatant insensitivity.”  You, of all people. Was it not you who’d mandated sensitivity training for the staff, yourself included? (Good for you, Doug). The infantilizing indignities of mandatory sensitivity training are nothing new to the students, of course. And yet the Argus reports that offenses are up. Could it be that mandates breed resentment and resentment breeds offenders? No, you inveigh: the increase must be “alcohol-related.” Doug, be a mensch: accept responsibility.  You speak of Wesleyan’s “academic rigor.” That’s boilerplate. I can recall a student who asked me how to write a footnote. Was she a first-semester freshman? No, a final-semester senior—it wasn’t until a month before graduation that she wrote an essay requiring one; all previous papers were exercises in navel-gazing: How do you ‘feel’ about Weber’s theory of Protestantism and capitalism?  That kind of thing.  You speak of “a rigorous Wesleyan education.” More boilerplate (you’re laying it on too thick). I can recall a Chinese teaching assistant who was told to dumb things down for his biology class; he had to make it “real easy,” he told me. I can recall an Indian teaching assistant who said he’d tried to teach his class not only WHAT mathematical formula to apply to a problem, but WHY. His students complained to the department chairman, who ordered him to teach the What without the Why.  Those two foreign students (and surely others) had come to  Wes with a reservoir of good will and respect for her; they’d left with that reservoir drained and refilled with disdain.  I can recall (and so can you) when virtually every faculty member read the Argus, at the time a NEWSpaper. I can recall the Beta Symposium on anxiety (“The Age of Angst”), in which professors read papers the Betas had asked them to write especially for the occasion. Doug, could you imagine a fraternity presenting such a diversion today? The symposium was food for thought, not action—we didn’t presume to have all the answers. Nor were we encouraged by President Butterfield, a gentleman of the Old School, to think that we did. How times (and presidents) have changed.       A professor to whom I recently addressed a Wespeak emailed his reply. Why no open letter?  Because, he said, he wished to avoid provoking one of those “endless squabbles” the students delight in. In Old Wes we didn’t have time for squabbles. I don’t know about you, Doug, but pretty much all that I had time for was Olin, whose Reserve Room (now Microfilms) was open and peopled with studious mooks (remember the term, Doug?) 24/7.       Fast forward fifty years. Erik Rosenberg ’08, in his Nov. 3 Wespeak, hectors his fellow students: “As a college student, you, more than anybody else in this country, have the time and resources to be politically active. You live in an environment that can be easily turned into a formidable political power. 95 percent of the people you live, learn, eat, fuck, party, and shit with have similar opinions regarding the war; all we need to do is walk onto the street together and were a force to be reckoned with. Channel your diligence and intelligence into something REAL.  Just the fact that you are in college means you have time to be political.” A student after your own heart, Doug.  Rosenberg quotes Director of Media Relations David Pesci: “The university is very careful not to openly take any political stance or promote any political agenda.” “Not openly” can hide a multitude of sins. In your letter to Zemach-Bersin you say: “Corporate America and some professions are less permeable than education or the not-for-profit sector, but even they are getting the word.” The word. Let none dare call it “openly” political.  With all due respect, Doug, may I ask what qualifies you to be giving “the word” to corporate America? If I didn’t know better I would be tempted to dub you an ideologue in drag, a dude who masquerades as an educator. Have you ever graded a blue book or paper? According to your resume, your entire career has been spent in the wealth-consuming public sector; yet you condescend to educate the wealth-creating private sector, the sector in which the Davisons, Denisons, Olins, Thorndikes, Walter Wristons, and many another alum have prospered. And thanks to their generous love for their alma mater, you’re able to live the High life in your servant-furnished mansion, and Talya Zemach-Bersin is able to be a Wesleyan Service Career Fellow. And when she bites the hand that feeds her, flaying “a world that is dominated by rich white heterosexual men,” you stroke her resentment.  She mangles her syntax because her instructors, failing to correct the lass, repeatedly gave her a pass. What’s your excuse? You write: “Thinking about the recent dinner, the guests would have been all male and virtually all white in 1959, my senior year at Wesleyan. This was ridiculous in retrospect.” Not half as ridiculous as the admission of Wesleyan’s Rodney Dangerfields (women) and the reactionary restoration of segregation in virtually all-black Malcolm X House. It bears your Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, even though its presence couldn’t be less consistent with the assimilationist position you took in your undergraduate years. (You forced the integration of a local all-white barber shop and induced your fraternity to disaffiliate from the national organization because it refused to integrate.) When will you acknowledge your flip-flop? (And when will you acknowledge that “The Art and Science of Education since 1831” is a lumbering, dime-store logo coined by a lumbering, dime-store mind? “The Cardinal Choice” is choicer.)  You say that “Wesleyan was able to change for the better” Under your tenure? In 1995 you swaggered into town and boasted that under your aegis the school, then Number 6 in US News rankings, would be one of the top three. Last year it failed to make the top ten.  As for that precious intangible, “the Wesleyan experience,” when you stroll through Exley’s lobby, its floor bestrewn with all the news that’s fit to print; when you walk across a campus littered with paper and plastic detritus; when you ascend the steps to Olin and pass a raggedy clothesline strung across its iconic Ionic columns gowned in handbills and/or garish plastic sheaths; when you shut your eyes to those blatant indicators of spoiled children despoiling their Cardinal choice (and soiling themselves in the process); when you have a student from an urban ghetto who pushed a fellow student through a plate glass window and faced no charges, owing to your good offices; when you have girls in women’s bodies hooking up in hopes of winning the coveted title of “Miss Disposable Commodity”; when you read the Wespeak pages trivia, incoherence, bathroom humor, and verbal ejaculations (“F*** you!”) hurled at girls; and when, having shut your ears to those hostile intonations, you declare, in the tone of a man who holds his truths to be self-evident, ‘new and improved’ Wes superior to Old Wes, all I can say is, “Doug,  whatever you say.” Which is ridiculous."
"Syracuse U. president applies town-gown relations to Wes","2006-12-01","by Katherine Manchester, Assistant News","Interactive, reciprocal initiatives between colleges and their local communities are essential for higher education to continue to enrich society, guest speaker Nancy Cantor said in a Center for the Arts (CFA) lecture on Wednesday night in the Memorial Chapel. “Momentum is growing to take public scholarship seriously, as a movement that will challenge and reshape the relationship between our colleges and universities and the society of which they are a part,” she said.  Cantor is the 11th chancellor and president of Syracuse University, in Syracuse, New York. She has gained national recognition for her strong advocacy in favor of public scholarship, a policy that she sees as fundamental if universities seek to benefit their communities. “If universities are to continue to expand our essential role in our democracy, producing innovation that makes a difference and educating enthusiastic citizens as well as skilled technicians, we must learn to construct these local collaborations in shared third spaces,” she said.  In the practice of public scholarship, Cantor said, the outward-looking stance of the projects often cut across the boundaries of traditional disciplines, geographies and roles. “The enterprise itself changes the relationship between expert and novice, between teaching, scholarship, and civic engagement—often rolling them all into one,” she said.  Cantor cited a number of Syracuse’s efforts to develop public scholarship, including the renovation of an old furniture warehouse in downtown Syracuse to house the university’s School of Architecture. “The Warehouse” also contains a public gallery, a café, and meeting rooms to be used by local artists and other community members.   “We are seeing the catalyzing effect of both the Warehouse itself and the concentration of design and entrepreneurial expertise downtown,” Cantor said.  At the moment, Syracuse’s most ambitious project is participation in constructing a “Connective Corridor,” a street that will run all the way across New York State in order to link suburbs with downtowns. In Syracuse’s case, this street will serve to connect the university with the city. “This will be a cultural corridor,” said Cantor. “It will connect all of the city’s cultural institutions [like] the local historical society, museums, concert halls, theaters, and galleries.”   Cantor stressed that, if carried out successfully, public scholarship initiatives allow universities and communities to interact in three crucial ways. “First, there is innovation that matters locally,” she said. “Public scholarship promotes discovery work outside of the ivory tower. Second, it promotes conversations that change the dialogue from seeing citizenship as a matter of stakeholder rights, to an act of community building among citizens with responsibilities to each other. Third, it brings new and diverse voices to the table, which has a strong democratizing effect.”  In the lengthy question-and-answer session that followed, Cantor addressed the audience’s queries about the finer points of public scholarship, and what stood in the way of such programs.  “Everyone thinks the question of money is the hardest,” she said, “But we have found that if projects are clearly seen as for, by, and with the community, they take on a lot of momentum very quickly, which galvanizes support. We don’t do projects within the community unless we have multiple partners.” Cantor noted that one of the greatest challenges was promoting the idea of change at a local level. “Sometimes people view local initiatives as parochial and narrow,” she said. “They ask, ‘What about the big picture?’ I don’t know about Middletown, but Syracuse has instances of every single global problem out there, especially in terms of immigration.”  One student questioned changes in perceptions of student safety, given a situation where so much community-student interaction was taking place. “I don’t think that students are any more at risk downtown than they are on University Hill, but we took the issue very seriously because we knew that safety concerns would be a psychological barrier to students’ comfort,” Cantor said.  While the audience was relatively small and consisted primarily of faculty and administrators, Cantor was well received.  Lauren Tinkoff ’07, student coordinator for the Green Street Arts Center, enjoyed the talk and found Cantor’s ideas applicable to the University community. “The lecture was especially relevant to me because Green Street is a practical application of the theory she discussed,” Tinkoff said. “Her talk was an inspiration to Wesleyan to expand its partnerships with Middletown and see the potential for positive change.”"
"Scobey urges an end to insular academic attitudes","2007-02-09","by Chelsea Sprayregan, Contributing Writer","David Scobey believes he has the solution for two cultural crises.  Speaking last Wednesday at the Memorial Chapel, he discussed the growing movement toward integration of university arts and humanities with community engagement.  Scobey emphasized the benefits that such integration would have in solving the respective problems of the university and the community at large. The universities’ predicament, Scobey explained, is a growing public disillusionment with higher education.  Citing budget cuts and a referendum vote against affirmative action in Michigan as evidence, Scobey explained that the public no longer considers the universities’ vast resources and autonomy to be justified.  These attitudes, accompanied by rising tuition rates throughout the country, have further entrenched the universities’ reputation as a bastion of elitism, isolated from general society. According to Scobey, this issue goes hand-in-hand with a larger societal crisis: that of growing distrust in government.  While widespread voter apathy presents the most obvious evidence of this skepticism, Scobey maintained it is only a symptom of a larger problem. Scobey argued that these crises can only be solved together, through community partnerships with university arts and humanities.  He advocated the creation of third spaces, where members of diverse groups can come together in collaborative ways to develop both civic culture and intellectual life, with the underlying belief that each group can offer the other something it could not have gleaned on its own. Members of the academic community, Scobey said, can gain a richer understanding of the people they purport to explain.   Scobey emphasized that the university need not lose any of its academic rigor, but rather that professional academics must apply this intellectualism in new ways based on insights they would not otherwise have found.  Scobey described the moment when he chose to work toward community engagement. “It felt like a turn away from the provincialism of academic culture in which I’d boxed myself,” Scobey said. In an often polarized society, Scobey explained that these community programs can help people to gain understanding of groups with which they would not normally engage.  More importantly, these diverse groups can work together, using the arts and humanities, in the process of “meaning making,” and thus regain a stake in their own civic life.  Given this dynamic definition of culture, university humanities and the arts must participate in the process of meaning making, or else its work of understanding society becomes a falsity. Scobey has directed two centers for community partnerships, and he used his experiences to ground otherwise abstract ideas in examples of successful projects.  Scobey spoke of a piece of artwork he recently viewed, a collage of different media that included interviews with members of the Arab community in Dearborn, MI and a poem about riding the subway after Sept. 11.  The piece came to fruition through the University of Michigan’s Arts of Citizenship program, of which he is former director. As present director of the Harward Center for Community Partnerships at Bates College, Scobey is working with a group of students in collaboration with a local museum to create an exhibit honoring the experience of Franco-American mill workers in Bates’ hometown of Lewiston, ME.  Scobey stressed the importance of collaboration within both projects.  “We create products and insights that none of us could create separately,” Scobey said. Before his lecture, Scobey spent the day at both the University and the Green Street Arts Center.  “It’s potentially just the kind of ‘third space,’ co-developed by the University and the community, where transformative work can happen that will enrich both Middletown’s North End community and the Wesleyan education,” Scobey said. The audience of arts and humanities faculty, community partners, and a few students proved highly receptive to Scobey’s ideas.  One woman raised her hand at the end simply to thank Scobey for his inspiring lecture.  Most of the questions addressed practical ways in which Scobey’s ideas might be applied. “It was very nice to hear someone talk about interaction rather than just seeing community involvement as going in and fixing whatever problems we see,” said Emily Sheehan ’10. The lecture mostly addressed institutional changes, and thus the faculty who might make them possible.  Yet the students who did attend were impressed.   “I think this is definitely going to give me some added inspiration to figure out what I owe the Middletown community or what I can learn from the Middletown community, and I hope to begin that process soon,” said Ari Tolman ’10. Scobey came to the University after meeting Pamela Tatge, director of Wesleyan’s Center for the Arts, and Rob Rosenthal, director of the University’s Service Learning Center, part of the Center for Community Partnerships, at a consortium of over 70 colleges called Imagining America. Imagining America is committed to work in public scholarships in the arts and humanities.   Tatge and Rosenthal invited Scobey to lecture as part of a series co-sponsored by their respective organizations entitled Scholarship and Action: The Case for Engagement. Nancy Cantor, president of Syracuse University, whom Tatge and Rosenthal also met at Imagining America, gave the series’ keynote address in November.  The three subsequent speakers, Scobey being the first, each represent one of the University’s academic divisions.  Tom Hayden will speak in March on behalf of the social sciences.  The speaker for April, representing math and natural sciences, is yet to be announced."
"Midge hosts dialogue","2007-02-13","by Mollie Laffin-Rose, News Editor","On Monday evening, Midge Bennet walked down to HiRise to reveal secrets about the role of first lady at a higher-education institution, living in Middletown’s landmark house, and what retirement holds in store for her and President Doug Bennet. About 15 students attended the hour-long open conversation that ResLife scheduled as a follow-up to President Bennet’s campus-wide dorm visits last semester. When ResLife mentioned to student staff members during August training that President Bennet was interested in visiting dorms, HiRise Residential Advisor (RA) Joe-John Sanchez ’07 extended the invitation. “As soon as they said that [the president was coming], I said, ‘Can Midge come, too?’” Sanchez said. Mrs. Bennet originally planned to accompany the president when he visited HiRise on Nov. 20, but she was unable to come due to a family obligation. Her attend visit this week is currently the only one that ResLife has scheduled. However, Bennet said that she would be happy to visit additional residences if students were interested. “It’s almost even better with just her, to focus on Midge and [her views of] Doug Bennet beyond campus policy,” Sanchez said. HiRise RA Emily Einhorn ’08 welcomed Mrs. Bennet and opened the discussion floor. “We wanted this to be an informal discussion,” Einhorn said. “We wanted to learn about you during your last year at Wesleyan.” Bennet graduated from the University of Georgia with a double major in English and Journalism. Her first professional experience was as a writer in advertising from which she moved on to volunteer in public television in Springfield, MA. In 1978, Bennet transferred to Hartford’s public radio, joining its founding staff as Vice President. Bennet found herself with leadership in an industry dominated by white males but, as she recounted, with no shortage of initiative. “You can’t be ignored for very long,” she said of being one of two women in large national meetings. Bennet’s female counterpart at the meetings was a black leader in public radio. “I don’t mind being the token, do you?” she recalled asking her co-worker. In 1983, Mrs. Bennet joined the National Public Radio (NPR) presidential search committee that ultimately hired Doug Bennet. Several months later, she served under the station’s new president as vice president for representation. They collaborated for the next 10 years, until President Bennet began a two-year tenure in the Clinton administration’s Department of State. The two co-workers began to date in November 1994. In 1995, Doug Bennet began his tenure as the University’s 15th president. In 1996, the two married and Bennet relocated from NPR in Washington, D.C. to Middletown. On campus, she found herself in a novel and challenging position. “I remember asking myself that same question before I even got here,” Mrs. Bennet said when asked what her typical day at the University is. During the Bennets’ first year on campus, Mrs. Bennet volunteered for so many projects that the Board of Trustees invited her to become a consultant. “It’s a nice, round title,” she said. “It develops everywhere. We get to meet so many different kinds of people.” Mrs. Bennet described the wide range of responsibilities that her position entails, from meeting parents and alumni to addressing new potential scholarships or a student’s death. “It involves always knowing that somebody’s going to knock on the door,” she said. “You always remember these very high and very low points.” Mrs. Bennet described her and the president’s campaigns at the University as an effort to invite Middletown into the campus and to improve town-gown relations. To illustrate their efforts, Mrs. Bennet recounted the summer when she and the president first arrived on campus. They hired a construction crew to refurbish the decades-old, dilapidated president’s house on High St., a landmark that exhibits the craftsmanship of generations of Middletown construction workers. After the project was completed, the Bennets held a reception in their new home to thank the crew. Mrs. Bennet repeated what the construction workers said in response to the reception and how it launched her and the president’s involvement in the city. “’In all the time we’ve been in Middletown, no one has ever been invited here before,’ they said,” Mrs. Bennet recalled. “We decided we were going to do what we could to change that.” During the past 12 years, the Bennets have invested in local businesses and hotels, supported the development of Main St., and collaborated on such community-based efforts as the Green Street Arts Center. Mrs. Bennet also noted that her husband meets with Mayor of Middletown Sebastian Giuliano once or twice monthly, without an agenda, to discuss current local events and development ideas. “A lot is going on behind the scenes that isn’t on the calendar every day, but that’s how you move things,” Bennet said. “One-on-one.” As the president approaches the end of his tenure at the University, Bennet said that they are immersing themselves in campus events and anticipating a smooth transition from this administration to the next. After May, the Bennets plan to spend time with their extended family. They have five children and eight grandchildren, expecting a ninth, between them. Midge Bennet’s youngest son, Richard Ramsey, and President Bennet’s youngest daughter, Holly ’94, are also married, having started dating shortly after they met at the Bennets’ wedding. The Bennets also plan to re-enter the political sphere. “All those things you put aside when you become president of a not-for-profit organization,” Mrs. Bennet said of political activism. “You really have to be non-partisan. I don’t care if I lick envelopes or whatever [after retiring]. I want to get back.” Much like President Bennet’s visits in the fall, Mrs. Bennet’s audience on Monday appreciated the opportunity to interact with an administrator in an informal environment. “It’s nice for her to come into our space and talk about things that we want to talk about,” said Petra Groeneveldt ’08."
"“Town-gown” panel addresses development","2007-03-06","by Nathan Whelan-Morin, Staff Writer","Students and Middletown citizens gathered in PAC 002 last Friday to discuss issues that both have struggled with for years. The meeting centered on topics of concern in Middletown neighborhoods, especially North End’s cycle of poverty and violence, the redevelopment of Main Street’s public transportation, and traffic congestion problems, which could lead to a tunnel built beneath the Connecticut River. The eight panelists represented a broad coalition of local organizations, all with a vested interest in Middletown development, including architects, representatives from the Common Council, the Middletown Redevelopment Agency, the Nehemiah Housing Association, the North End Action Team (NEAT), and the Village District. The meeting was part of the Center for Community Partnership’s First Friday series, uniting students and Middletown citizens on the first Friday of each month to discuss “town-gown” collaborations. To initiate the meeting, each of the eight panelists described their vision for Middletown.  “For me, it’s all about creating a place where people want to live,” said Professor of History Vijay Pinch. Lee Osborne, an architect who served as chairman of the Zoning Committee for eight years, said that one of the reasons he likes Middletown is because it has “texture.”  “Our school system is one of the reasons my wife and I moved here,” Osborne said. “We wanted our children to grow up in a real world.”  However, a number of the panelists were hesitant to attribute too much to Middletown. “Like Bill [Warner, another panelist], I don’t feel we should be pounding our chests about how great downtown is and get overconfident about it,” said Gerry Daley of the Middletown Redevelopment Agency and the Common Council. Mark Maselli of the Village District echoed Daley’s sentiment. “I’ve been thinking long and hard about Middletown, and I’ve come to the conclusion that we are too often doing things that are not Middletown scale,” he said. “We are taking initiatives that are done in Hartford or New Haven and we’re bringing them here to town.” A large part of the dialogue was devoted specifically to problems in the North End. “We have, in the North End, a census track that is extremely poor,” Osborne said. NEAT was formed in 1997 to foster collaboration between citizens, city officials, and students while confronting the drug dealing, violence, and poverty that were prevalent in the North End. Lydia Brewster, a member of NEAT, felt that the organization was successful in putting the North End agenda on the city’s table.  To deal with housing shortages and other struggles with poverty in the North End, some suggested affordable housing units. Village District resident Jennifer Alexander ’88 vehemently opposed this idea. “Anywhere else but the North End,” Alexander said. “I would like to see not one more affordable unit built in the North End. Why? Because it doesn’t work. Economic monoculture does not work.”  Panelists agreed that communication in general is necessary. “To be successful, we have to have a social dialogue,” Maselli said. “And so my view is, we either have an engaged population, one that there is discourse in and at all levels [or we don’t}. If I have a vision, it is the recapturing of our newspapers.” Alexander and Brewster agreed that one issue that makes resolution more difficult is the effort to improve diversity in Middletown schools by redistributing students who live near each other. “Do you know how hard it is to organize a community when a simple thing like the neighborhood school isn’t even in one area?” Alexander asked.  During a question and answer session, one member of the audience asked if there were any plans to tunnel the highway so that Middletown could be more connected to the river.  The Department of Transportation had been pushed to build a tunnel, but money has remained an issue.  Questions also touched on transportation, from the difficulty of finding public transportation to parking lot development on Main Street. “We have too many vehicles on the road today,” Daley said. The panelists rejected the idea of surface parking lots in downtown Middletown and said that the main obstacle to public transportation is the high volume of passengers. “I think that a livable, walkable downtown in America is like a diamond,” Alexander said. Pinch closed on a positive note, expressing pride in his neighborhood. “I love living in Middletown,” Pinch said. “If you don’t get involved in your community, you’re just passing through.”"
"Bennet legacy forms","2007-03-30","by Ezra Silk, Assistant News","With Michael Roth ’78  announced as incoming president, the campus is cautiously celebrating the choice of an academic candidate and reflecting on the occasionally controversial legacy of departing president Doug Bennet.  Though at present most only have an initial impression of Roth, his long intellectual background in art, history, and psychology has given many people high hopes for an era focused on core academic issues. As for Bennet’s legacy, most agree that the University has significantly changed under his leadership, especially due to the essential fundraising efforts. These helped pull the school out of a twenty-year economic slump, allowing for badly needed building projects. The real question, according to many, is whether the University has changed for the better over the last 12 years and how much of that change was caused  by Bennet or by national academic trends beyond his control.  Molecular Biology and Biochemistry Professor Mike McAlear, a who served on the Faculty Interviewing Panel that helped select the new president, was very impressed by Roth.  “This new guy—he’s articulate, he’s smart, he’s thoughtful,” McAlear said. “If you were to sit down and meet him, you would think that this is a bright, engaging man. Very, very impressive.” Holly Wood ’08 was pleasantly surprised by the choice. “I was really expecting someone from a pharmaceutical or science background, given the push toward the sciences,” Wood said. “They really surprised me with this selection. He’s also coming in and telling the Hartford Courant that he wants to teach classes here, which is fantastic.” Some believe that choosing Roth reflected the changing demographics of the Board of Trustees and the alumni network.  “Think about who is on the committee now,” said Brendan O’Connell ’08. “The alumni who are electing trustees and the trustees who are choosing presidents reflect a new Wesleyan.” The Wesleyan that Bennet found when he took office in 1995 was a fund-starved institution reeling from the years under the unpopular Chace administration. “They had done such a bad job in previous years,” said Joyce Jacobsen, professor of Economics and former chair of the faculty. “When I got here in ’93, they were still cutting positions.”  Over the years, bad investments continued to mar the school’s financial situation. “In the ’60s, Wesleyan used to be the richest school per capita in North America,” McAlear said. “But that dwindled away and there wasn’t adequate fundraising afterwards to maintain that.” And so one of Bennet’s first initiatives was to launch the first fundraising campaign in years—an extremely successful effort that, upon its completion in 2005, had raised $281 million and doubled the endowment.  “The faculty are very thankful for Doug’s fundraising,” Jacobsen said. “It has made us into a university that has not had to use adjuncts and TAs to teach classes.” The new money has funded a variety of projects. These include 20 new teaching positions, 140 new scholarships, a number of economic developments in Middletown, such as the Green Street Arts Center, and, most significantly, a considerable amount of construction on campus. Renovations include the Center for the Americas, the Admissions building, the Patricelli ’92 Theater, Memorial Chapel, and Clark Hall. Some of the new buildings are the Fauver residences, Usdan University Center, Zelnick Pavilion, the Center for Film Studies, and additions to the Freeman Athletic Center. But the manner in which funds are allocated has faced criticism by some.  “If you look at the total sum of it, at least some of that money could have been invested in libraries, faculty salaries, and the core academic mission,” McAlear said. On Sept. 26, 2006, more than 20 faculty members signed a Wespeak that demanded higher faculty salaries and criticized the distribution of funds. “The recent spending decisions have been unbalanced, and have undermined the fundamental strength of the university: the very professors that teach the classes, mentor the students, and conduct the research and scholarship,” they wrote. “Wesleyan wouldn’t be ranked sixth in its class nationwide for academic reputation without them.” The faculty’s salary grievance seems to fit into a sentiment among some professors and students that characterizes Bennet as more focused on campus beautification than on the core academic mission and student concerns. “The balance of priorities has shifted more towards services and facilities,” McAlear said.  Wood also had problems with the allocations.  “Bennet let there be no central campus space for ten years,” Wood said. “I don’t think it was intentional—I just think his priority was to get funds, which he did well. His priority was not to build solidarity among students.” Many students were not as forgiving as Wood. In 2004, a crowd of around 250 students confronted Bennet and barred him in his office for several hours. The group, acting on behalf of a number of different student concerns, demanded greater transparency in Bennet’s decisions.  “It was a systemic critique of how the administration works,” said O’Connell, who participated in the protest. “It was a critique of how they were making decisions behind students’ backs, speaking through the WSA, and assuming that the WSA represents the entire student body.” The action aroused controversy among faculty and students. In a disapproving Wespeak, Emily Frost ’06 distanced herself from the protestors.  “I am truly embarrassed by the way the student body was represented on Wednesday afternoon,” she wrote. “I felt as though one group of student activists appropriated my voice as a Wesleyan student by pretending to represent the entire student body. I hold some of the concerns that were raised on Wednesday, but I would never have treated President Bennet the way that a few members of our student body did.” Bennet did not appreciate what happened, either.  “He was pretty upset about that,” Jacobsen said.  Other issues, such as the controversial chalking ban in 2003, have cemented among some a reputation of an administration that runs the school more like a corporation than a university. In response, groups such as the faculty caucus and the facebook group “Keep Wesleyan Weird,” which was recently featured on the front page of The Hartford Courant, have cropped up.  Yet most agree that stronger corporatist attitudes and a higher priority on campus aesthetics are signs of the times, as opposed to being attributable to the attitudes of an individual president.  “These are national trends, and I certainly don’t blame Bennet,” Jacobsen said. “Changes also occur as an institution gets older.” Wood acknowledged that national trends played a huge role, but she still is not convinced that Bennet did all he could to stop them.  “Bennet let this stuff happen,” she said. “He could have done more to fight against it.” Bennet’s legacy may become easier to assess further down the road. For now, students and faculty alike hold high expectations for the incoming President. Professor of Sociology Rob Rosenthal has been a huge supporter of Bennet’s efforts in improving town-gown relations and helping improve Middletown in general, and he hopes to see more of that in Roth. “Wesleyan has supported the town by revitalizing it without gentrifying it,” Rosenthal said. “I hope the new president will continue in the same direction.” McAlear also hopes that Roth will learn a lesson from his predecessor. “Things are going to be very different than they were under Doug Bennet and [former Vice President] Judith Brown,” McAlear said. “I’m hoping that this administration will be more consultative to the faculty.”"
"Bennet immortalized in song and dance","2007-04-03","by Matt Connolly, Farts Editor","The presidency of Doug Bennet will be commemorated with song and dance this fall at the CFA Theatre. The Theatre Department recently announced the upcoming production of their original musical, “I’m With Midge!,” which promises to be a frothy, fun-filled romp through a bitterly divisive presidential tenure. “The life and legacy of Doug Bennet has always had a musical quality to it,” said Assistant Professor of Theatre and show director Jacques Footman. “You can especially find it in his public speeches. Where some hear barely audible garble, I hear passion and…pizzazz!” Footman, who will direct a cast of University students, envisions a highly stylized fantasia of light, color, and glorious show tunes. He says he has been working closely with show composer Schmueli Rosenberg to develop songs that will reflect the many sides of the soon-to-be-former president. “There’s Bennet the administrator, Bennet the fund-raiser, Bennet the corporate bureaucrat,” Footman said with a sigh. “What more could a musical theater director ask for?” Recognizing Bennet’s executive role at National Public Radio prior to his presidency, much of Rosenberg’ score will be comprised of sleepy acoustic guitar riffs and vaguely exotic saxophone solos. Complimentary tote bags and coffee mugs will be available at the door with an optional donation of $100.  Footman says he is inspired by the great musicals of the past, and will incorporate them into his production. A pre-Bennet town-gown interaction on Main St. will recall the Sharks-Jets rumble in “West Side Story.” The construction of the Zelnick Pavilion, in an Act I showstopper entitled “It’s Only Ugly If You Look At It,” conjures up the building of the barricades in “Les Miserables.” Aspiring actors seemed thrilled to be portraying such iconic figures. Lucinda Beltway ’10 originally said she’d be vying for the coveted role of Maria Cruz-Saco. She seemed more uncertain when Footman then informed her that, to better reflect her role on campus, Cruz-Saco would never be seen on-stage, but would be represented through a series of poetically read e-mails.  “It’s still an amazing part, though” Beltway said. “I mean, her e-mails were so…constant.” Dave Zingler ’09, meanwhile, insists he has what it takes to play “the big man” himself. “I totally got the voice,” Zingler said. Upon being complimented on demonstrating this voice, Zingler left in a huff. “You could understand what I was saying? Damn it! I thought I had it!” Zingler yelled as he walked away. Footman says the path to production has been a long one, fraught with obstacles. He particularly regrets writing the entire libretto and score in chalk in front of Davenport Campus Center. Bennet’s famous chalking ban went into effect the day after its completion. “Looking back, a Word document might have been a better choice,” Footman said."
"Students value houses despite clash of views","2007-04-06","by Miriam Leshin, Staff Writer","Though the big red house on Pine Street is often affectionately referred to as the “Red Barn,” it is technically the Women of Color House. Upon entering the house, it is clear that its six residents have infused their creative spirit into every aspect of their home—down to the bright purple sticky notes on the kitchen cabinets that detail their contents. According to its mission statement, the house was created in 1990 as a “safe place for all who are committed to women of color issues on campus.”  Priya Ghosh ’09, a resident of the house, explained that although she didn’t strongly identify as a woman of color prior to Wesleyan, she wanted to live in the house because it was important for her to be accepted in that community. In contrast with schools such as Vassar College and Williams College, Wesleyan offers a wide array of program houses that cater to students’ interests in racial, ethnic, and religious identities, as well as the outdoors, activism, and the arts. Student opinions, however, differ as to whether or not identity-based program houses merit a place on college campuses. “I definitely can understand why the idea of identity-based program houses makes people uncomfortable,” Ghosh said.  She explained that this lack of comfort is often caused by the “bad assumption” that being of the specified identity is a requirement to live in that house. “Not only women of color can understand these issues, but people who make an effort to understand them,” Ghosh said. Alana Miller ’08, House Manager of the Bayit, the Jewish community house, agreed with Ghosh.  “The only requirement to live in the Bayit is to show an interest in Judaism,” she said. “It doesn’t mean you have to be Jewish [to live there].” Though identity-based program houses do not only accept students of that identity, Adeneiki Williams ’10 suggested that program houses may be partial to students of that identity. “In some sense, program house applications do favor people who are of that group because they might have more experience with the idea of the house,” said Williams, who plans to live in X-House next year. According to Miller, regardless of who lives in program houses, the entire campus community can benefit from them. “The goal of program houses isn’t just to program for a specific community,” Miller said. “It’s also dedicated to the whole community, and reaching out to others.” Fhatima Paulino ’10 decided to live in La Casa next year for similar reasons.  “I want to be able to spread Latino awareness as a part of myself, but also show it to other people who aren’t exposed to it and maybe all they know are stereotypes,” she said. Dawn Brown, the Area Coordinator for Program Houses, said that program houses create a unique environment.  “These spaces on campus are seen as a safe space to some, which truly helps them flourish and be empowered to have a successful experience here at Wesleyan,” she said. Daniel Teraguchi, Dean for Diversity and Academic Advancement, concurred.   “Program houses are essential for building community,” Teraguchi said. “[They are] places to rejuvenate, reflect, process, and relax.” Teraguchi also explained that Wesleyan’s program housing system is conducive with the ABCs for engagement: Affirming Identities, Building Community, and Cultivating, Leadership, a concept created by Beverly Daniel Tatum ’75. In her article, “The ABC Approach to Creating Climates of Engagement on Diverse Campuses,” Tatum explains that since most students enter college with stereotypes and prejudices, there is a need for engagement, through methods that affirm identity, such as program houses. “Students who feel affirmed in this way are more likely to be willing to reach out beyond their own identity groups,” she concludes in the article. “With program houses, people have a base where they feel secure, so they are more open and willing to participate in the campus community,” Williams said. “It also shows that their institution respects their cultural identity… If universities have sports teams, Greek houses, and other places of identity, then program houses should be a part of that mix. It’s uniting people of a common interest, like all clubs and groups.” However, some feel that these houses segregate students. “I just wonder if it’s worth losing a group of people who are really into the outdoors or activism in a certain area, if they are isolating themselves,” said Jordan Brown ’10. “I’m not saying that happens, but it could happen.” “Program houses create segregation, and that is something this school is supposed to be against,” said.

"WesFest: Middletown battles for college town status","2007-04-20","by Jessie Schiewe, Staff Writer","Many students come here from bustling metropolitan centers such as New York City, Boston, and Los Angeles. For these students, Middletown may be a surprising and, at times, disappointing college town. While the town certainly features some perks, such as a movie theater, good Thai restaurants, and bars, the relationship between town and gown often leaves both feeling isolated. The distance between Middletown and the University campus has proven to be somewhat of an impediment. Many students and local businesses blame the distance between campus and downtown as the main deterrent to community cohesion. Without the cohesion encouraged by close location, they say, the full potential of Middletown as a college town can never be fulfilled. Christie Grasis, owner of A New World Laser Town, lamented the effect that students’ absence has on her business. “Wesleyan students tend to stick to campus,” Grasis said. “Middletown is not geared toward college students, but then again, it’s because they are not the market most businesses are trying to reach. Wesleyan students tend to do their own thing.” Saruk, an employee and son of the owner at Empire Pizza, shares the same sentiment, claiming that New Haven is a better example of a college town. Though Empire Pizza derives a good portion of its business from the student population, he said that the overall atmosphere of Middletown is lackluster and boring compared to what it could be. “It’s much quieter in Middletown than in New Haven,” Saruk said. “New Haven has a much livelier neighborhood. They have Urban Outfitters, movie theaters, and lots of places to eat and shop. In order to improve Middletown, they should add more fun places, like more clubs and bars for the students.” Many students say that they rarely leave campus, either stating that they are content with the offerings on campus or that the inconvenience of going into town is too great. Mary Claire Abbott ’09 said that Middletown is not “cute enough,” citing Princeton as an example of a college town that is more connected with its students. However, there are some business owners and students who disagree that there is a significant barrier between campus and town. David Galanto, owner of Metro Spirits, argues that the impact that students have on his business, as well as their presence downtown, proves that Middletown is a college town. “It’s getting better than it was 10 or 12 years ago,” Galanto said. “Back then it was a ghost town. Now many businesses have expanded to let students use their [Wes] ID cards as both a means of payment and a way to get discounts.” An employee at a Main Street restaurant said that though Middletown is not as lively and wild as some college towns, one can observe, merely by walking on the streets, the footprint that the student body leaves on the town.  Indeed, the clientele at Main Street restaurants is often heavily comprised of college students. In the summer, restaurants suffer from their absence. Many of the unique and varied businesses that are available downtown seem often forgotten or taken for granted, according to some students. Middletown offers students an abundance of small businesses, ranging from restaurants, bars, and movie theaters to tanning salons, rollerblading rinks, and laser tag venues. Ultimately, Middletown’s small size and its dependence on Wesleyan may make for a more meaningful relationship than a similar university might have with a big town or city.  “Middletown isn’t the worst,” said Katie Hanna ’09. “In Middletown ,you have a chance to get involved with the community, to give back, and feel like you are a part of it.”"
"Roth returns: Community welcomes alumnus as President","2007-05-01","by Lindsay Ceballos, Staff Writer","Last Friday, students, faculty, staff, community members and administrators crowded the pews of Memorial Chapel to hear President-elect Michael S. Roth ’78 address the campus community. In an improvised speech, Roth stressed what will be three tenets of his presidency: freedom, equality, and solidarity. “I’m a historian, I’m a French historian,” Roth said. “You’ll recognize where I’m getting these things.” Chairman of the Board of Trustees Jim Dresser ’63 introduced Roth, describing the process of his selection and enumerating his credentials.   “He [Roth] embodies the qualities of leadership we seek to develop in our students, and his career reflects the sort of innovation and achievement we intend to maintain and even accelerate at Wesleyan in the years ahead,” Dresser said.  Dresser linked Roth’s commitment to liberal learning and innovation to past presidents in Wesleyan’s history, including Wilbur Fisk and Victor Butterfield. “Michael’s strengths as an institutional builder echo and complement Colin Campbell and Doug Bennet,” he said. “We look forward with excitement and anticipation as we welcome a new leader for the next chapter in the history of this great institution.” Assuming the podium to a standing ovation, Roth articulated his vision for Wesleyan’s future as a leader in the arts and sciences, as well as a promoter of equal opportunity for students. “Freedom—what does freedom have to do with a liberal arts education?” Roth said. “What I discovered at Wesleyan—it really changed my life—was that one can be free while one is working. In fact, what I learned from my teachers was that there was a great body of thought given to how you achieve freedom when you’re doing this most human thing: working, creating, building.” Roth said that work and intellectual engagement facilitate the cultivation of critical skills that students can apply toward a greater good. “That pursuit of excellence through hard work and serious intellectual endeavor together with freedom was a promise you could as a student learn how to work in such a way that after graduation you had a shot at working in our society,” he said. Roth’s second tenet, equality, draws a fine line between promoting diversity and demanding high academic quality in students. These two things do not have to be mutually exclusive, Roth argued. “Equality is a harder concept to connect with an elite institution like ours,” Roth noted. “How do we make an institution dedicated to doing the very best work possible in some very difficult fields that require enormous preparation? How do we combine that search for, demand for, excellence with a commitment to equality?” Consistent throughout Roth’s address was a high standard for Wesleyan’s future with the hope that Wesleyan will become exemplary of high academic and social integrity in higher education. His plans for Wesleyan were anchored by the third tenet of his speech: solidarity. “How do you find a way despite our differences, despite our passionate disagreements, how do you find a way to promote community and solidarity?” Roth asked. Roth commended Bennet’s administration for its pursuit of solidarity among the student body and the campus community as a whole.  “It is something that we can teach the rest of higher education, that we can be an example of for the world,” Roth said. “We can be a place that teaches freedom, that values equality and diversity, and that manifests at every turn a real desire for solidarity and community.”  Roth’s speech ended with another standing ovation as Bennet took the podium, clapping heartily, to present a gift to Roth of an image of College Row from the early 1900s and to make concluding remarks. “I am thrilled to know that this institution that I love so much will be in such capable hands,” Bennet said.  Roth and his family, Doug and Midge Bennet, and the Search Committee remained on the stage to greet members of the audience as they moved to the Zelnick Pavilion for refreshments.  Students present at the speech expressed optimistic sentiments and a desire to see if Roth’s ambitions would pan out in the years to come. “I’m really glad that he’s optimistic and seems to be willing to engage this institution at its academic roots and its community roots. My only concern is that he may be taking that solidarity for granted and I hope he’s committed to fostering that commitment,” Gavin Robb ’07 reflected after the speech. “I’m very excited. I was very impressed by his eloquence today. He’s very thoughtful and articulate and he has been through the whole search process,” remarked Professor of Russian Language and Literature Susanne Fusso, who served on the Presidential Search Committee. The speech in the chapel was only one of several events Roth attended while visiting campus last weekend. On Saturday, Roth met with student representatives from various academic departments and spoke about his own experiences as a Wesleyan student in the McKelvey Room of the Admissions building. “Don’t just think about it,” Roth remarked on what Wesleyan students could do with their education. “See if your smarts could actually change something in Middletown, could actually stop a war, could actually change the way you think about something.” Roth’s experience at Wesleyan as a student in the 1970s, much like that of today’s students, included its share of both intellectual rigor and political activism. When asked if he knew where the president’s office was, Roth gave a tongue-in-cheek response.  “Yeah, I slept there when we occupied it,” Roth remembered, referring to a 1977 student protest against companies invested in South Africa during apartheid. “That wasn’t an invitation.”  Whatever future the Roth Administration has in store for Wesleyan, there was undoubtedly a buzz of excitement and enthusiasm this weekend as the Wesleyan community met their new president—a sentiment possibly captured by Bennet’s concluding remark. “I feel so happy,” Bennet said."
"Q and A with President-elect Michael Roth","2007-05-01","by Greg DubinskyEric Lach, Editors-in-Chief","Saturday morning, we sat down with Michael Roth to ask him about his trip, his personal experiences as a student, and his plans for Wesleyan come fall. Note that the interview is edited for brevity and clarity.  Greg Dubinsky: I was thinking about the focus of your work while you were speaking [in the Memorial Chapel on Friday], this idea of freedom through work. I almost felt like I was reading Introduction to the Reading of Hegel. [Editor’s note: This is a book written by a philosopher, Alexander Kojéve, whose correspondence Michael Roth edited.] Michael Roth: (Laughs) Oh goodness gracious, that’s right, you’re on the inside. GD: It was interesting to me to find out a bit more about that, and how you would connect that idea to practical outcomes and issues such as chalking or the independence of departments, or how that translates into practice.  MR: I think the way it would play out in specific Wesleyan policy or around Wesleyan issues is something I don’t know enough yet about to comment in an interesting way. Someone gave me a box of chalk yesterday and my daughter immediately grabbed it thinking it was for her. She said, can I play with this? “No!” What I was trying to say yesterday in regard to freedom and work was that the education at Wesleyan taught me that there was a way one could work that was an expression of what one hoped to be. And getting a sense of that as a social scientist, a biologist, a musician or a writer, whatever the field, gives one a sense of human capacity and a feeling of freedom that sets a platform for how one wants to work after graduation. One wants to find a way of working in the world that is significant for oneself and one sees making a contribution in the world. And there are lots of ways to do that. It doesn’t have to be through some narrow prism of academic work or narrow version of activism. So the contrast I was trying to draw was between that and the kind of work where one feels alien to oneself. Work that most people have to do in our culture. Which is, it may be monetarily satisfying, or not, but you don’t feel like yourself when you’re at work. What I learned at Wesleyan, from doing it myself and from looking around at people who were joyful about what they were doing, was that there are ways of being dedicated to a pursuit that allows you to discover who you are and what you want to be and how you can make a difference in the world.  Autonomy of departments, I don’t know. I don’t know enough about what that means at Wesleyan. I’m not a departmentally oriented academic. I can say that. It’s probably pretty clear from what I’ve done. I don’t believe in the silos of academic departments, I think that requirements are bad. I learned that here—we debated that endlessly when I was a student. I think it’s great for students to have the freedom to choose the kinds of courses they want to take and to make their own way. Sometimes that can be within a structure. If you’re a music major, there’s a structure of how to progress, or [also] if you’re a biology major. Sometimes it can be much more self-generated, as I had a University major. I think the key is that you are following your passion and you are discovering what you love to do. My sense is that the reason a lot of students become so loyal to Wesleyan is that they really do discover what they love to do here. Then they get better at it and that’s great fun and exciting. And they make friends around their work and sometimes through their work. And that’s a gift I believe. As a result, students may be critical of the University, because they want it to be even better, to provide that all the time or in a deeper way, but they are also incredibly loyal to the University because of that gift, because of that experience. I hope that begins to answer that question. Six months out, your successors can expect a more detailed answer.  Eric Lach: It seems people were pretty pleased with your talk yesterday in Memorial Chapel. I’m wondering how you set out to write your introduction? MR: (Laughs) I didn’t write anything, I didn’t know what I was going to say. I do have this, I don’t know what to call it, maybe it’s a symptom, maybe it’s a tick, maybe it’s a style. I do like to improvise. I guess I learned that at Wesleyan. I took jazz piano lessons here from a wonderful instructor.  Justin gave me a couple of points, to thank so and so. And I looked at those in the afternoon, and then I was thinking in the afternoon, “What am I going to talk about, what am I going to talk about, this is too important, Roth, to do your typical improvisation.”  In San Francisco, I do a lot of public speaking, and it’s like a dog that can sing—“Gosh, he’s improvising again.” And I enjoy that and people seem to like it. But I thought this is going to be webcast, I can’t say, “Whoa, I didn’t really say that.” “Yes, you did!” And I kept wondering if I should write it down, I heard the voices of authority saying, “You should write it out, you’re a writer.” But I really felt like the energy would be better, and everybody said it should be brief, if I just said what came to mind.  So, I thought, okay, as you know, I spent a lot of time with Hegel at Wesleyan and since, so I do think in threes. So I thought: if I have three points in my head I won’t get lost. And then it just occurred to me when I saw the police car in front of South College as we were getting photographs, I thought, “Okay, I’ll do liberty, equality, and fraternity.” So then I was a little nervous, because I thought, that’s all I knew that I was going to do, talk about freedom, equality, and, when I teach I translate “fraternity” into “solidarity” or “community” because I think it’s the contemporary expression of that ideal—it’s not sexist. And I remembered when I had this notion of freedom and work, which was here at Wesleyan, so I thought it would be fitting to say that, but I didn’t know what I was going to say. And my wife said, “I think you have four things, because you put diversity in there.” But I didn’t think of it until I said it. So last night I listened to it on the web just to see what the hell I said! (Laughs) And being in a chapel, I’m a wannabe rabbi, people say, or preacher, and so when I get in a chapel I’m even more inclined to [just] see what happens. So the process was really to come up with the structure of three things and then see what happens. When you’re playing jazz or rock and roll, it’s even simpler, you need a three-chord progression. If you know you are going to do A, D, and E, you’ll see what happens. EL: So we shouldn’t expect a reign of terror next year, though, right? MR: I did think of that. Somebody might say the Nazis said, “Work makes free.” So there are lots of incredibly oppressive versions of these ideals. But that’s true of great ideals—some people distort them into horrible things. And that’s something to be mindful of. But I don’t think it’s a reason not to be idealistic, it’s just a reason to be thoughtful. GD: It seems that part of the definition of freedom is having the capacity to affect one’s environment, and maybe a corresponding obligation to affect one’s environment in a positive way. I’m wondering what your thoughts are on Wesleyan’s connection to Middletown and how that might play out in your administration? MR: I heard really positive things about how Doug Bennet and Midge Bennet have built partnerships with Middletown. And I want to understand that better. My own interest and values lead me to want to develop connections for the students and the institution with the city we’re a part of and the state we’re a part of. I think it’s really important for students to understand not only the campus they’re on, but the city they’re in, and the political context in which they live—beyond the campus. That would mean like service learning, which I know has become more important at Wesleyan over the years, but it also means project-based curriculum, which interests me a great deal. Where students can actually take classes, the content of which is heavily inflected by practical projects in the world, and that can be in a science class or in a political science class [or others].  I think that participation is a key value in the arts, so students learning how to not only perform for spectators but to engage people into participatory art-making is a really interesting experience and very educational, and it also is great for the people who are invited into the mix of making. And I’ve done all those things with colleagues in Claremont and Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco, and I would expect to find opportunities to do that here. I haven’t been to the Green St. Center yet, but I understand it’s a really interesting place and I’ve gotten notes from people who work there and I look forward to visiting it. And there may be other avenues for that connection to happen, and I would certainly be very supportive of developing those connections. They’re not just expressions of altruism, which is not a bad thing, but they are really vehicles for learning—for students, faculty, and staff. One of the things you learn is about citizenship and being part of the community, which I do think is connected to the values I talked about yesterday.  I muck around on the guitar and piano, it’s not something I can do unless it’s a really good party, but playing a little bit changes the way you listen, and dancing a little bit changes the way you watch, and I think that’s a very important experience to have. The practice of creativity, the practice of thinking, changes the way you understand what people who are experts in the area say.  GD: Should there be a mandatory commitment to civil [or] civic service? MR: There could be, you know that’s where you would no doubt detect a contradiction, if I wanted that, because I don’t like mandatory commitments. I have in the past thought about that. At other places like CCA my first thought was, “We have requirements, why don’t we have a service learning requirement and why don’t we just hire people that teach that way,” but it was the wrong thought. Because what happens when you make things a requirement is that people aren’t interested in them. So I don’t know if requirements are the answer here. I kind of doubt it, just given a little of what I know so far. But making it really great is what draws people, and then they’ll want to do it. Again, I do think sometimes structure is important, but my prejudice is to not go to that structure too early. Invitations are better than force.  EL: So you mentioned yesterday at the student talk that you had been involved in a takeover of the president’s office. I was wondering what you were protesting.  MR: Oh, God, did I say that? That had to be improvised. We were protesting apartheid. The reason I hesitate is because the other big protest I was involved in was—well, less involved with when I was here afterwards—was Seabrook, New Hampshire, a very hot issue in the late ’70s. The nuclear power plant at Seabrook gives me food for my political philosophy classes today.  EL: So you guys took it over for a day, or a couple of days? MR: No, I don’t think it was a couple of days. I remember it was probably a day, a day or so. It would be, I guess, ’77-’78, that year. I remember President [Colin] Campbell coming in and being very gracious. What happened was, and I think this is what we wanted, is that it became a conversation about how to engage the issue at the university level. I’ve learned about it since and talking with people about [how] what the University did in regard to divestment in companies doing business with South Africa was really an engagement with those companies, forcing them to explain themselves in a public way, because as stockholders you had this kind of leverage, which if you just sold your stock you’d no longer have. So it was a very interesting process, much more sophisticated than I understood at the time. Part of it came out of the fact that there was a community revulsion against the regime in South Africa—it took longer in a way, but I think in a way it was a more significant action of engaging these companies, forcing them to respond to these political and moral issues. GD: So success can be a difficult thing to define for many at a university like Wesleyan. I’m wondering: how would you measure [the] success of Wesleyan while you are there? Would you rely on the U.S. News and World Report? What would be the criteria that you would use to measure how you’re doing, where you can improve? MR: There are a couple of things. It’s a really important question, and I want to determine in the next few months which metrics would be the most important and to use them. Everyone seems to agree that Wesleyan is underresourced in regard to its competitors—the endowment per student is not as high as it is at Williams and other schools. One very important goal for the future, that the Bennet administration has made very good progress on that needs to be continued and accelerated, is to bring more resources to the University. A key metric for me will be successful fundraising. I think we talked last time about doubling the endowment. It seems like a good goal to have. I don’t know how much time it will take to do that, but in the first year I’ll know how much time. We should double the endowment, and part of that will be from intelligent use of the resources, and part of it will be from bringing new resources, a combination of those.  One of the really important aspects of that is that it will allow us to provide more access to people. I think one of the things that I didn’t make clear in my remarks yesterday—I listened to them last night—is exactly where would equality come out in policies. I think access to Wesleyan and access to universities like Wesleyan is a really important issue in the United States and internationally. A university like Wesleyan can’t be a place for only rich people. Need-blind admissions is really very important, but nonetheless the preparation you need to be successful in the admissions process is clearly very biased by class, at least—other things too, but class plays a big role. To have a university like Wesleyan make the contribution to opening up this dream of great education to more talented people who don’t have the advantages of education earlier on—that’s the question. I don’t have the answer yet. And I don’t think Wesleyan can do it alone, but I do think Wesleyan should be a leader in this area, and Wesleyan should work with other institutions to create avenues for success for people—whether it’s for middle school or high school —to give them the preparation so they can go to an elite university—that could be Wesleyan, Harvard, oh, Williams wouldn’t count—kidding!—but, you know, to play a role [in] making education function not just as a way of supporting privilege but as a way of giving access to the kinds of values I talked about yesterday. Bringing resources is going to be important to do that—you need money to do that. You’re not going to take it out of the current program, that’s impossible.  Another measure will be who wants to come to Wesleyan. I want the applicant pool to continue to grow. It grows nicely. We have incredibly great applicants. I looked at the profile of the class coming in—it’s incredibly impressive. Let’s take the things we like the most of the applicant pool and let’s say, “How do we improve those things by five percent to seven percent per year?” Make it really hard, actually—it’s a tough goal to reach. The demographics are going to flip soon. Right now you don’t have to be a genius to get more applications because more people are at that age, but in a few years that will change. So how does Wesleyan know people are finding out how great the place is? More people want to come here. More people, not just in Boston, New York, and this corridor, but in San Antonio, Austin, Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco—they say, “Oh, Wesleyan, that’s the hot school, that’s the place. I want to go here.” You know that not just from a newspaper article or something, but from how many qualified people are trying to get in. I’m not trying to expand the size of the student body, [but] it’s a good way of seeing how the message is getting out in the world. And the more the message gets out in the world, the better it is not only for the metrics, but for the people with a Wesleyan diploma, because people just value it more and more in the world. It’s already valued very highly, of course, but more and more people will value it very highly. People who know about education know about Wesleyan, but that’s only one group of people. As you move toward the Midwest and the West, the school is not as well-known as it should be, and certainly there’s been progress there—more applications from California and elsewhere. That can accelerate. What is the level of student satisfaction? That’s a metric that’s very important. I’m not sure what the best tool for measuring that is yet. Retention is very high, but Wesleyan is in a way beyond retention. You don’t just want to retain people, you want them enthusiastic and excited about being here. How you measure that—it’s harder to measure, but we’ll figure out some way to measure that. Faculty engagement and satisfaction. Are you able to hire the very best people? When you do a search, do you get the first choice? I think we do most of the time—I can find out what the number is, but we obviously have to be even better. We’re not so close to perfect that we can’t be better in that. But how do you retain people, how do you reward them for the great work they do? That’s another metric.  Those would be some of the more easily measurable things. The partnership with the city, the role in politics, is harder to measure. I do think there you get to issues of identifying stakeholders—people whose opinion about the place you care about—and somebody other than the president will find out: how do they think we’re doing? Don’t ask Roth’s mother how he’s doing, ask the mayor of Middletown, or the senator, or people who are running the community health center. Once you identify that constituency pool, you identify people whose thoughtful evaluation of performance you take into account. So those are some of them.  EL: So there’s a popular sentiment on campus that Wesleyan every year is getting less “weird”—the key word. For some reason the students have this image of the ’70s, when you were here, as the weird time, that Wesleyan was at its weird peak. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how Wesleyan was “weird” or how this label to some extent got put on Wesleyan? MR: (Laughs) I don’t know. That’s a good question. I didn’t think we were weird. I’ve heard this—I don’t know how popular it is. American education has gotten more corporatized—it’s not just Wesleyan, look at the country. But at the same time, there’s a kind of not just tolerance but an acceptance of diversity and of self-expression and experimentation that now—it’s taken for granted at Wesleyan. It wasn’t like that in the ’70s. It may have felt weird to people [then] because people were more likely to have led sheltered lives before they came here and be surprised by differences in sexual lifestyles or identity or politics or other things.  I think now people perhaps just take a lot for granted in terms of the embrace of difference within a community. Last night after the student reception, I was invited to dinner at Open House—I didn’t know what that was. I think it’s great. I don’t know that when I was a student that that would have happened with the president. I think it might just not have happened. And so that’s a good thing. The fact that it’s not weird that they asked, or that someone said, “Ooh, that’s weird,” or something. I think that’s good, actually. “Yeah, I’d love to go to dinner there, let’s talk about this or that.” It would be a mistake to put too much of an emphasis on idiosyncrasy—to search out idiosyncrasy for the sake of idiosyncrasy—that seems kind of childish to me, actually. Sometimes there are real principles at stake, and you want to make sure that people have a certain level of freedom and have a certain level of respect, and those are really important issues. But to test those standards for the heck of it—that seems to me not very interesting. There are real issues out there that people violently disagree with off campus—starting with affirmative action, or the war, or any number of issues—take the politics where it matters, I would think. And Wesleyan could be the place where you get the tools to do that, or to learn about it, to have good arguments—not just good arguments for people with like beliefs, but how do you have a good argument or a reasonable conversation with someone who doesn’t share your views? That’s different from trying to get someone who shares most of your views to go on the edge because you say something so upsetting that even they can’t accept it—that seems puerile. So, “Keep Wesleyan Weird?”  I think that Wesleyan has been for a long time a place of serious experimentation—that’s different, I think, from what I’ve just described as childish—serious experimentation, where people are passionately devoted to exploring new territory—and the place where it comes out most importantly is in their work. They’ve thought about stuff in ways no one else has thought about it. And the teacher turns to the student and says, “You talk about this. Let’s read your poem. Because you’re doing stuff I haven’t thought of.” That happens at Wesleyan. Or you do an experiment that creates new knowledge, or you put on a theatrical production that moves people so tremendously that they are stunned. That happens at Wesleyan. That’s experimentation.  Is it weird? Yeah, it’s weird, but it’s not pursuing the bizarre, it’s creating the new. So everything I can do to help students and faculty create the new, sometimes through exploring very old things, I really want to do—but the culture of shock, or of testing, I think it’s a bit of disservice actually to the culture of serious experimentation that Wesleyan has been known for. I mean, “serious” seems like a stodgy word. Norman Brown was here in the ’50s, and Carl Shorske and Bucky Fuller, John Cage—talk about weird, right? but they were pioneers. They were changing the way people felt about education, sexuality, culture, music, and silence—they were breaking barriers, and working very hard to do it—joyously, it wasn’t just testing. GD: What’s the thing you think you know the least about, or the thing you want to learn the most about?  MR: (Laughs) There are so many. It’s hard to just say one. I guess the one at the top of my list right now is the sciences and the science building, because it’s a very important issue for the institution going forward. I’m really looking forward to learning more about scientific practice as it is now taking place and how people imagine it will be taking place 10 years from now, because I just don’t know that much about it, and as a cultural historian, I should know more about that, and it’s a really important part of understanding the world and at Wesleyan. It’s a really good thing to learn more about it, and I’ve asked the provost to send me things—research papers and articles. I love being a student, as you can tell, and this is my way of going back to school in the sciences. That’s really on the academic front.  And then—I always talk in threes—on the student side, I really want to understand why students come to Wesleyan today, what is the draw today, and what is it that makes Wesleyan compelling to somebody before they come and how they experience the school in relation to their expectations. And that’ll just be going to the dorms, or the houses, and listening to students talk about their expectations and experience—that will be fascinating for me. I could see the enthusiasm of people for the place yesterday, and now I want to find out what’s the content of that. And then the third one would be the relationship of the campus to the city, the region, and the state. Just getting a handle on that will be important to me as someone leading an institution that can make a real difference in the city and the region."
"Freshmen stats show continued trends within school admissions","2007-08-30","by Elyssa Pachico, Editor-in-Chief","Although it may be fruitless to define the average Wesleyan student, the 739 students in the class of 2011 altogether reflect average trends in University admissions from the past three years, even as the number of applications continues to increase. Out of 7,750 applicants, 2,123 were accepted, signaling a five percent increase in applicants, as well as a five percent increase in offers of admission. The University remains one of the most selective in the nation, with a selectivity rate of 27 percent, the same as last year. Even if diversity in terms of geography, students of color and student income did not undergo a radical change with this year’s matriculated class, Senior Associate Dean of Admission Greg Pyke says that students of 2011 remain a diverse group of unique individuals, each with their own idiosyncratic story to tell.  “I think what’s notable about admissions becomes clear as you get to know the individuals and the stories that they represent,” said Pyke. “That doesn’t show up in a percentage moving up or down a few numbers.” The number of students who applied to Wesleyan through Early Decision this year also remained similar to the year before, dropping to 38 percent from 39 percent in 2006. Pyke said that Early Decision has been part of Wesleyan policy for the past 30 years and is not considered a controversial process. Recently, peer institutions such as Harvard, Princeton and Yale have stopped offering Early Decision programs, arguing that it places lower-income students at a disadvantage because it may limit their ability to compare financial aid packages from a wider selection of schools. “Like a lot of small liberal arts colleges, Wesleyan’s Early Decision program has really served the school well,” Pyke said. “It allows some students to identify the college as their first choice in November, and allows others to matriculate in April if they want to do so.”  46 percent of students received financial aid this year, a four percent increase from last year, but at the same time three percent lower than the recent high of 49 percent financial aid for the class of ’07. The percentage of enrolled students who are the first in their family to attend college remains the same as last year at 14 percent, as does the percentage of students of color at 32 percent.  Students who identify themselves as Asian American remain the largest group in the first year student-of-color community at 15 percent, while the number of African American students dropped two percent from last year, from nine to seven percent, as did the number of enrolled Latino students, from ten to eight percent.   Reflective of an increasing, nationwide competitiveness for a place in the top liberal arts schools, the class of 2011 was significantly involved in challenging high school coursework: 80 percent of enrolled students had taken a fourth year of a foreign language. “In looking at individual applications, we do take note of groups, teams, organizations and publications that an individual participates in,” said Pyke. “But we also understand that students have to be students first.” “Generally speaking, the most important part of a student’s record is their academic engagement and intellectual promise,” he added.  Also reflecting an effort on the part of the University to attract more students with a strong interest in science, 79 percent of enrolled students had taken Biology, Chemistry and Physics in high school. Along with a $2.5 million pledge for a renovated Science Center awarded last April, as well as the $500,000 grant for research equipment given to the Science Department last September, the University continues its push towards increasing the prominence of the sciences within its curriculum. \t “We always take into consideration what is underrepresented in the Wesleyan student body,” Pyke said. “That can be geography, or students with an interest in science.” The median verbal SAT score remained steady at 700, as it has for the past four years, while the median math SAT score dropped 10 points from last year, from 700 to 690. Meanwhile, the SAT writing score jumped twenty points, from 690 to 710.  “It’s always good when a score goes up,” said Pyke, “but we’ll have to wait three to four years before we can see what the median score for that test is.”  The majority of the student body continues to hail from the East coast, with 23 percent of enrolled students from New England and 38 percent from the Mid Atlantic states, including New York. Both of these statistics have only changed one percent since last year. However, with ten percent of enrolled students coming from abroad, the number of students living outside the U.S. is at an all-time high. Pyke said that continuing to attract students from outside of New England will remain an important goal for University Admissions, as representatives from the Admissions Office continue to travel extensively on the West coast and in the Southwest, the Caribbean, Hawaii and Asia. Typically, members of the Admissions Office travel with a group of representatives from other universities, including Davidson, John Hopkins and Swarthmore, visiting high schools and at times attending receptions in the homes of alumni."
"Assaults raise PSafe vigilance","2007-09-18","by StarRose Keyes-Lebergott, Contributing Writer","Two assaults against Univeristy students last Saturday morning have led to increased action by both Public Safety and the Middletown Police Department. The incidents have highlighted the sometimes delicate relationship between students and Middletown residents.   “This is not the first time we’ve had incidents like this,” said Director of Public Safety David Meyer.  However, Meyer also admitted that he is “concerned that we’ve had this number [of assaults] in this short amount of time.” According to Meyer, the first incident, which occurred shortly after midnight on Church Street, was a verbal confrontation between a group of approximately 15 to 20 high school students and a group of Wesleyan students.   Christopher Alvanos ’11 witnessed the altercation. “[The two groups were] yelling obscenities at each other, and a couple of people from the group of high school students had to hold their friends back,” Alvanos said.  \t During the second assault, which took place only an hour later in front of the HiRise buildings, “several punches” were thrown by a group of high school students, according to Meyer.  Although two Wesleyan students received cuts and bruises, neither wished to receive medical attention.   The two assaults follow less than a month after an assault of a Wesleyan student by two high school-aged boys. The incidents have motivated Meyer and Interim Dean of the College Michael Whaley to confer with the Middletown Police Department about the safety of students on campus. “This has been an ongoing discussion for us about campus security…[Meyer] is our liaison to the Middletown Police Department, and he has already been working with them on trying to identify the group of folks who were responsible for these incidents,” Whaley said.   Meyer stressed that the University maintains a productive relationship with Middletown Police Chief Lynn Baldoni.  “[Baldoni] is gathering a couple of people to see how they can be of assistance [to us] to come up with a set plan to prevent these incidents in the future,” Whaley said.   According to a Public Safety alert that was sent to the Wesleyan Community on Saturday morning, Middletown Police and Wesleyan Public Safety increased patrols of the campus after the assaults. Despite these cautionary measures, Meyer claimed that relations between the Middletown community and Wesleyan students should not be considered more strained because of the recent assaults.   “I think for the most part [the relationship] is very positive, and you can’t let a couple of incidents tarnish that,” Meyer said. While Meyer said that he couldn’t speculate as to why the high school students targeted Wesleyan students in particular, Richard Meyst, a Middletown resident for 22 years, commented on the feelings of resentment that some of the Middletown community has towards Wesleyan students.   “There is arrogance from most Wesleyan students because Wesleyan is considered a ‘rich kid’ school,” he said.  Nevertheless, Meyst encouraged both Middletown residents and Wesleyan students to look beyond their preconceived notions of the other. “It’s a bad stereotype from both sides… it’s not fair to classify these kids who assaulted the students as ‘townies,’” he said.  Similarly, Meyer feels that passing judgment on the Middletown community based on two isolated assaults is uncalled for.   “A lot of people in Middletown appreciate Wesleyan students,” Meyer said. “I’d hate to label this as a bad town-gown relationship because of a few incidents.” For now, Meyer urges students to be alert. “Be aware that these things happen, and be aware of your surroundings,” he said."
"Learn about the environmental and social consequences of coal","2007-11-06","by Yael Tarshish, Virginia Weihs, On behalf of Earth House","Although we depend on Appalachia for our energy, we often remain incognizant of this region and the devastating environmental and social consequences it suffers and has suffered from decades of coal mining.  Today over three million people live within one mile of abandoned mine land, where the majority not only experience great poverty, but also face water contamination in the form of acid mine drainage (AMD) and poisonous sewage discharges.  The issue of global warming has finally begun to command widespread attention from people concerned about the future of human and ecological communities, but it is also important to recognize that communities right now, in this country, have already long borne the costs of the energy production that powers our lives.  Want to learn more and what can be done to help?  Come to the lecture “Coal, Collaboration, and Community: Trans-Disciplinary Environmental Action,” given by Dr. T. Allan Comp on Tuesday Nov. 6th, at 7:30 pm, in the Daniel Family Commons in Usdan.  Dr. Comp is a historian, an artist, a community organizer and a government bureaucrat, too. He is the founder of the coal site reclamation and water remediation project  AMD&ART, which is “one effort to confront this legacy [of coal production]…[via] a model of holistic renewal that brings the perspective of history to mix with the discipline of science, the delight of innovative design, and the energy of community engagement” (Comp, www.amdandart.org). Winner of multiple awards in partnerships and planning, Dr. Comp now directs the Appalachian Coal Country Watershed Team and does other coal related environmental remediation and community revitalization work throughout the country.

"Roth praises activisim, questions chalking","2007-12-04","by Bradley Spahn, Staff Writer","President Michael Roth spoke about his ongoing campaign to spread and strengthen the University’s reputation, as well as redefine academic priorities, at Sunday night’s Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) meeting.  Roth also spoke candidly about his conception of the ideal Wesleyan student, his issues with chalking and attempts to “Keep Wesleyan Weird.” “I have been impressed by the serious, energetic activism of groups at Wesleyan working for peace, on the environment, on anti-racism, and on behalf of workers,” Roth said. “This is not about weirdness, it’s about progressive politics and building our campus culture.” WSA member Saul Carlin ’09 asked Roth about the “Keep Wesleyan Weird” movement, which began last year amid criticisms that administrators were lessening the University’s uniqueness.  “Frankly, I think its nonsense, it’s puerile,” Roth said. “Wesleyan has been a leader in political struggles. That’s not weird, that’s admirable.” Roth said he discussed what makes Wesleyan unique at November’s Board of Trustees meeting, and emphasized the University’s core values. “Wesleyan has been at the forefront of critical thinking about issues of social justice since the 1960s,” Roth said. “This is far more important than cultivating an interest in the tunnels, or composing anti-corporate juvenilia.” This response prompted another question on chalking, to which Roth expressed reservations about chalking as political expression. “I don’t really have an opinion on writing on the sidewalk with different colored chalk,” he said. “I’m more interested in what people say than in the colors they use to write—whether they put the ideas in chalk or on flyers. I wish energy was used in making a difference in neighborhoods in Middletown, or on national issues rather than expressing an attitude.” Roth reiterated his previously stated goal to identify Wesleyan as a bastion of political action among liberal arts colleges and to distinguish its public image from that of peer schools like Vassar and Williams.  Roth also discussed potential changes to the University’s academic program. He echoed earlier calls to create a required capstone experience for seniors. “When everyone goes through Wesleyan they should go through something that is intense and academic,” he said. “There should be something of parallel intensity, almost ritual. All seniors would go through it. I think it would add a lot to the school.  I’m eager to find a way to find that Wesleyan can have seniors do something ’Wesleyanish’ before they graduate.” As the admissions season ramps up, Roth said he initiated a discussion with the Board of Trustees about what qualities Wesleyan should be looking for in new students. “What Wesleyan students should be, we’re looking for students of extraordinary academic ability in all areas with proven achievement in one of more of those areas, passionate engagement on those ideas with other people, a taste and appetite for discussing issues in a community with a tolerance for views,” Roth said.  “It’s a tall order, it’s a lot of things. The key for me is students who have courage, capacity, and care.”  WSA President Matt Ball emphasized that change was not something that students have to fear. “Students can be afraid of change,” Ball said. “[Chair of the Board of Trustees] Jim Dresser once said that you can count on students to be more conservative than the Board when it comes to change. We have to realize that change can be good.”  Ball spoke to suspicions of Roth’s plan to redefine the University across both the nation and world. “Yes, he’s intent on redefining the image of Wesleyan, but not in the ways that people are scared about,” Ball said. “It’s not about mainstreaming Wesleyan and making us exactly like Tufts. It’s about emphasizing that negative stereotypes about Wesleyan are not true. I think that’s good.” WSA Organization and External Affairs Committee member Robert Alvarez ’11 enjoyed Roth’s talk. “I agreed with a lot of the things he said,” said. “He’s a great speaker and a very charismatic person, and I appreciate that.” Ball underscored Roth’s continued commitment to listening to students as he solidifies his plans for the University. “He is goal setting right now, and he’s talked a lot about setting institutional and academic priorities,” Ball said. “He invited the WSA to come up with a list of student priorities that he can take into consideration when he makes his list of institutional priorities, and that gives students a great opportunity to shape the future of the school.”"
"Response to Matthew Nestler","2008-02-01","by Benedict Bernstein,","Dear Mr. Nestler, I generally try to avoid responding to Wespeaks, as such responses often devolve into mere personal attacks in which grammatical and semantic errors take precedence over the real facts of the argument. I also believe that disagreements are best worked out face-to-face. However, I feel personally compelled, as a student of the history and politics of the Islamic world, to disagree with much of your Wespeak. However, I am not going to disagree with all of your Wespeak. Most importantly, I agree with you that there are compelling reasons for a continued American commitment in Iraq. I do not necessarily agree with all of these reasons. My concerns with your argument are numerous. However, I will limit myself to two major points of disagreement. First, I believe your comparison of the situation in Iraq with American engagement in Afghanistan in the 1980s to be spurious. Second, I find your telling of the “tumultuous and dynamic history” of the Middle East to have little basis in reality. I respond to these two points not only because they are the basis for your argument against withdrawal from Iraq, but because they are closely tied to such misinformed and silly notions as, “they hate the fact that we are free.” While I in no way claim to be an expert on Afghanistan, I do know that American withdrawal from Afghanistan was not the only cause of the Taliban’s rise to power. Indeed, the social and ethnic complexities of Afghanistan make their rise to power far more complex than a simple “radicalization” of religious society. The Taliban are overwhelmingly Pashtun, whereas much of the ruling bureaucracy had been Tajik, Uzbek, and Hazara. Furthermore, the Taliban’s rise to national power began in 1994, and Kabul was not captured until 1996, nearly seven years after American withdrawal. I also have serious questions about your telling of the history of the Middle East. First, you imply that from the earliest years of Islam, which is officially dated to 622 C.E., the “Middle East” (a term of Occidental invention which has little meaning to the region’s inhabitants) has been in a state of turmoil. I agree that the Arab and Islamic world has seen significant changes over the past 1,400 years. However I would counter by saying that Western Europe and the United States have similarly undergone numerous crises, including the Reformation and the resultant religious violence in the Holy Roman Empire, slavery, the Inquisition, World Wars I and II, the Holocaust, and the invention and use of the atomic bomb. I could go into great detail about the early years of Islam, the four “Rightly Guided Caliphs,” the Battle of Siffin and the Shia/Sunni split. However, I simply do not have the space. Suffice it to say that while the Islamic world has experienced its share of violence, it has also been one of the earliest empires to truly tolerate multiple religious beliefs, and was, under the early Abbasids, the sole repository and savior of a great deal of “Western” knowledge (i.e. the Bait al-Haqm and the Barmakids). From a scriptural standpoint, the tolerance of the “religions of the book” (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) is a fundamental principle of Islamic rule. In general, non-Muslim inhabitants of Muslim lands (the dhimmi) were protected and treated within the precepts of the Pact of Umar and the Constitution of Medina. Furthermore, you describe a long history of conflict with the Christian occident: “Christians and Muslims have battled in the Crusades, the Spanish Reconquista, and the European/Ottoman struggle over the Mediterranean.” Indeed, “Christendom” has often come into conflict with the Islamic world. However, do you really find Muslim intransigence in the face of the Crusaders so galling? Or the defense of Muslim lands against a “reconquista” so baffling? Finally, you posit the Iranian Revolution of 1979 as the key turning point in the “rivalry” (I find your use of this term indicative of your bias) between Muslims and Christians. You claim that the Iranian revolution “vindicated the extremists while ousting the moderates.” I agree that those who came to power in 1979 have been rather extremist in their views. I do not however agree that the Shah was a “moderate.” While he may have been thoroughly westernized, and was installed and supported by the U.S. and U.K. after the democratically elected leader of Iran nationalized the oil industry, the Shah relied on autocracy and state violence, epitomized by the SAVAK’s notoriously unlimited powers of surveillance and detention to rule Iran. The notion that the Iranian revolution is the cause of current extremism does not match up with the facts. It is important to note that the vast majority of the terrorist attacks you listed came after the U.S. began stationing troops in Saudi Arabia. Indeed, the largest supporter of terrorism around the world has consistently been the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and members of the royal family. Not to mention that 15 of the 19 hijackers responsible for the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 were Saudi and all of them were Sunni. Iran is Shia. Linking the uniquely Shia experience of Iran and Hezbollah with the attacks of Sept. 11 and the larger project of al-Qaeda ignores the larger and older internal conflicts that have shaped modern Islam. In conclusion, while I feel there are compelling arguments for continued U.S. involvement in Iraq, you did not make them. I ask that if you would like to respond to my arguments, or would like more information about anything I have said, that you contact me directly. This offer extends to any member of the Wesleyan community. Sincerely, Benedict Bernstein"
"634 for O’Rourke’s?","2008-02-08","by ,","Beloved diner O’Rourke’s will be reopening on February 11th, partly due to extensive fundraising efforts by Middletown residents, Wes alumni, University administrators and current students. The effort to rebuild the historical diner is a model for how town-gown relationships should be, in which past divisions are put aside in favor of working for a common good (in this case, the common good involving hash browns and pancakes that all can enjoy). As any student who’s ever shame-facedly crossed Broad Street to avoid walking in front of Traverse Square could testify, there’s no denying the tension between Wesleyan’s “ivory towers” and Middletown’s North End. When students head back to O’Rourke’s to enjoy an alternative to Usdan’s brunch, in between bites of scrambled eggs they should question why O’Rourke’s functions as a safe space for students, unlike other Middletown locales such as, say, the Red Dog Saloon, the roller-rink or even the local bus station, which don’t see the same rate of student use. As the recent initiative to install security cameras around campus shows, safety is undeniably a psychological barrier in the University’s dealings with Middletown. The coalition that came together to rebuild O’Rourke’s, however, is an inspiring example of town-gown collaboration across barriers. It is most definitely a reminder that the University has a responsibility to instill in students a sense of obligation when it comes to engaging outside the “ivory towers.” Students should also take inspiration from the fact that youth turnout most definitely contributed to Senator Obama winning the Connecticut primary. According to the Middletown voting registrar, 634 students registered as Democrats in order for their vote to count on Super Tuesday. What if 634 students spent two days a week volunteering at the Green Streets Arts Center? Or what if 634 students turned out for local Middletown elections, not just for national elections? If 634 can demonstrate such enthusiasm for  Obama or Clinton, we hope that 634 can also find a way of demonstrating such enthusiasm for even more community building between the University and Middletown."
"Point/Counterpoint","2008-03-04","by ,","Culled from 47 faculty and administration proposals, the five initiatives recently presented by President Michael Roth offer a wide swath of ideas on academic, extracurricular, and admissions changes within the University. We applaud Roth for drawing upon the faculty’s experience and insight when attempting to determine new policy. While recognizing that many of these initiatives remain in the planning stages, however, we cannot help but temper praise with frustration over each of the initiative’s often amorphous and ill-defined nature.  1. Strengthening the University Experience: Greater encouragement for seniors to undertake “capstone” projects may convince certain departments to broaden opportunities for those who wish to complete something other than traditional senior theses. Mandating a common class for all first year students, though, would likely result in a superficial academic experience, and seemingly contradict the University’s insistence upon flexible curriculum. 2. Internationalization: Efforts to double recruitment of international students underline the key role they play in the Wesleyan community, but the University should remember that geographic diversity also extends to underrepresented areas of the United States. As for improvements within the Office of International Studies, numerous complaints regarding credit transfers point to an issue in need of immediate attention. 3. Creative Campus: The proposed expansion of writing opportunities within the University (more courses, a potential writing certificate program) reflects a positive response to student demands. Overall, though, the initiative neglects to illustrate how the University plans to foster creativity within other majors. 4. College of the Environment: Increased attention to environmental issues are not unwelcome, but we fail to see how this proposed interdisciplinary program (modeled after the College of Letters and the College of Social Sciences) would substantially differ from pre-existing programs like the Science in Society or the Environmental Studies Certificate programs.   5. Civic Engagement: This proposal’s focus on encouraging community partnerships appears well intentioned. When over 60 percent of the student body participates in some form of community service, though, how much do we really need the administration’s encouragement? We anticipate and expect more details from the administration regarding these initiatives in the coming months. If not, the time and effort put forth by consulted faculty members will have resulted in little more than high-minded rhetoric."
"Creative campus: Roth, faculty plan enhanced curriculum","2008-03-04","by Brooke Olaussen, Contributing Writer","After reviewing faculty input on various aspects of the University, President Michael Roth has outlined five broad initiatives forming a list of the University’s priorities: strengthening the undergraduate experience, internationalization, the “creative campus,” College of the Environment and civic engagement. In October, Roth invited faculty members to submit two-page proposals addressing any aspect of the University’s educational experience. Faculty members submitted a total of 47 proposals—many of which were written by several professors or entire departments. Most of the proposals focus on developing and expanding curriculum.  The main thrusts of the first initiative, strengthening the undergraduate experience, include hiring more professors, creating a more concrete first year program and encouraging all students to do some type of last year project that would function as a “capstone experience.”   The particular components of this plan have yet to be decided upon. One possibility is to broaden first year initiative courses to include a required freshman course, the goal being to give more shape to the first year experience at the University. Roth would also like to see each student do some sort of senior thesis or project.  “Many students do this already but we haven’t successfully described this experience and tied it together in a coherent way,” said Roth.  According to Roth, this means broadening the idea of a written senior thesis to whatever could be creatively integrated into the student’s particular discipline.  The second area of focus looks to change the way the University approaches international studies. Referred to as “a stool with three legs,” this initiative looks to globalize the curriculum, double the number of international students, and strengthen study abroad programs. A Middle East Studies Program is in the works.  Roth also says that he would like to see more languages taught here. Parts of this language initiative will be implemented as part of the Summer Language Institute.  “Creative campus,” another initiative, will be an effort to expand students’ creative work to all areas of campus, from arts departments to molecular biology. Roth would like to see students exploring creativity through experimentation that would serve their respective disciplines.  “Wesleyan has an edgy, creative, experimental, risk-taking student body,” Roth said.  He feels, however, that the creative work produced is not consistent across the university, and would like to make it easier for students to be creative in their field of study. As part of fostering a more creative campus, Roth wants more art courses and an expanded writing program. The new writing program is likely to include a writing certificate program, possibly a writing major in English, more writing courses and writers on campus, a Writers’ House that coordinates events with the Writing Program’s Distinguished Writers series and an expanded Wesleyan Writers Conference. “President Roth has expressed his strong interest in Wesleyan’s writing programs,” said Director of Writing Programs Anne Greene. “The particular configuration of the new programs is being discussed.” The idea of the Writers’ House is to have a center for student writers that will involve them closely in writing activities and writers’ visits. Within a year, the Writers’ House may also include a student residence and coffee house. The non-resident house programs will begin next year, using the Russell House as a center.  New writing tutorials are being planned, as are other workshops and special events for students. Greene is now asking each guest writer who visits the University to compile a reading list of books for students who are interested in training themselves as writers. These reading lists will be used in new student-run writing tutorials. Alex Ross, the well-known blogger and music critic for the New York Times, is coming this Wednesday and will be preparing the first booklist. Also being considered is a graduate studies program in writing as well as a screenwriting program.  The fourth initiative is the College of the Environment, which will be an enhanced environmental studies program modeled off of the College of Social Sciences and College of Letters.  “[The goal is to] graduate students who are conversant in environmental issues,” said Professor of Earth and Environmental Studies Barry Chernoff, who authored the proposal for the College of the Environment. “We have to understand better our relationship to the environment in a deep and scholarly way. If it comes to pass, the program will work to graduate citizens to change the fabric of life for the country.” The environmental studies major would be the second component of  the  major. The senior “capstone experience” would integrate environmental studies into whatever is appropriate in the student’s primary field of study.  “Environmental issues by their nature are multi-disciplinary,” Chernoff said. “It’s so central to campus, environmental studies in a sense belongs on Andrus Field.” As with the other initiatives, the time frame for this program is still uncertain. An enhanced commitment to civic engagement is the last of the five categories outlined in the plan. Focusing on “action and study,” Roth would like to bring programs like the Green Street Art Center, Traverse Square and WesPREP together in a coherent form and facilitate monetary donations to these programs.  “I’d really like every student to have the possibility of some dimension of civic engagement in their Wesleyan education,” Roth said.  Professors were pleased with Roth’s openness to their ideas and criticisms.  “It is a way of honoring a faculty to ask their opinion of what direction should the university go,” said Professor of American Studies Claire Potter. “It speaks well of a president when he begins his work at the institution by doing this.” After all of the proposals were submitted, faculty, administration and senior Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) representatives convened to discuss, rank and roughly group the proposals. Since not all of the proposals can be implemented, they tried to look for  themes that could be developed into areas of focus. Proposals called for earlier academic commitment or major declaration, more COL and CSS-like programs and more graduate studies programs (in areas such as writing and film, for example). A proposal for a medical school at Long Lane was even considered. Other proposals include creating a digital library and a racial and ethnic-directed studies concentration for freshmen and sophomores.  Students were also impressed by the initiatives. “The mere fact that he recognizes activism and creativity at Wesleyan is enough for me,” said WSA member Alex Levy ’08 said. “I appreciate that. It’s unrealistic to expect sweeping changes. In six months Roth has done a lot.”  In his hopes to engage all members of the University community with these initiatives, Roth will soon be inviting both students and alumni to share their ideas for the University."
"Bennets ease into retired life","2008-03-28","by Suzanna Hirsch, Features Editor","When asked if he is still administratively involved with the university, a relaxed and convivial former President Doug Bennet could not help but chuckle. “No, ma’am,” he said. Since stepping down as president, Bennet and his wife, Midge, have moved to a small farmhouse in Lyme, CT along the Connecticut River, where they are enjoying all the perks of retired life. “It’s nice to have time to clean the barn,” he joked. While retirement might seem luxurious, Bennet explained that he moved on to his new life with some ambivalence. Still, he said, the shift was a necessary step to take. “I always enjoyed the work as president and being involved at Wesleyan,” he said. “Now this is just sort of a different time of my life“different but an appropriate new stage.” For Bennet, who was both University president from 1995 to 2007 and a member of the class of ’59, a more distant role in the University community represents a change, but not a radical one. “I’ve had several different engagements with the University over the years and this is just a new one,” he said. Bennet spoke passionately and enthusiastically about the University. He recalled with fondness each of the roles he has played here, singling out his inauguration day as a particularly joyful memory. “The day I was inaugurated was wonderful,” he said. “There was this sense of opportunity, a real sense of potential. Looking back, I feel gratified that we were able to get a lot done and leave with the University poised to do a lot more in the future.” Bennet has returned a handful of times to visit friends or attend lectures. Although he thoroughly enjoys every trip he makes back to campus, he feels it is also necessary to slightly distance himself from University life. “One of the things we’ve done sort of on purpose is to not completely follow every little thing that is happening on campus,” he said. “That’s not really my role anymore. Now it’s time for just staying on the sidelines and cheering.” Luckily, Bennet noted that there are many recent University changes that a sideline cheerleader can comfortably and ardently applaud. He expressed enthusiasm about President Michael Roth’s efforts, which both continue projects begun during the Bennet administration and endeavor to improve the University in entirely new ways.  “It’s wonderful to feel that you have a successor who knows the school and has a vision for where it can go,” he said.  He also praised the University’s capacity to adapt to change while staying true to certain core values.  “I am confident of the place and confident in its ability to change,” he said. “Flexibility is a big part of Wesleyan’s ability to endure. After you [as president] leave, you would never want the University to be exactly what you prescribed for it, but rather you want it to keep those values and continue to prosper.” Bennet noted that from the moment he arrived as a college freshman until today, one central facet of a Wesleyan education has remained constant: the University’s devotion to a well-rounded, liberal arts education. “My own career was made possible by the strength of my liberal arts career at Wesleyan,” he said. “It gave me opportunities and an ability to try different things that is extremely gratifying. Generations of people go through the place, and I think your generation will find the same. Wesleyan has an intellectual and academic vitality that will have to be constantly renewed.” Regardless of his current distance from campus, Bennet remains confident in the University and its future. “There would be nothing worse than sitting here on my porch having to tell you, ’I wish Wesleyan was doing this, I wish it were doing that,’” he said. “I feel really good about where the University is going.”"
"Endowment conference shares ideas on investing responsibly","2008-04-15","by Becky WeissKathy Stein,","Last Friday we attended a conference on investor responsibility on behalf of the Endowment Advisory Committee (EAC), the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) student group that makes recommendations to the Investment Office on shareholder proxy resolutions. This national gathering of campus investor responsibility committees was hosted by Columbia University and organized by the Responsible Endowments Coalition, a national organization that works with students to promote investor responsibility. This was the first time that campus representatives, other institutional investors, and money managers came together to discuss the challenges and possibilities for socially responsible investing. We wanted to share some of the things we learned with the community.   In addition to gleaning knowledge about the functions of these committees, such as the best practices for proxy voting, divestment, transparency, and accountability, we also gained a better understanding of what the investment landscape looks like now, and how it has changed. There has been a remarkable evolution in socially responsible investing. When the pioneers of the field began talking about socially responsible investing forty or fifty years ago, the approach was to avoid morally reprehensible or irresponsible companies. This produced a number of asset management companies as well as corporate watchdogs. It also probably produced the notion that socially responsible investing necessarily meant lower returns, since the tactics were largely limiting and avoided certain investments. After years of experience and many additions to the field, SRI has evolved into a sophisticated and ambitious approach to encouraging long-term, market-wide change in corporate policy. Corporate engagement, which is the biggest and most exciting new tool, has arisen from a number of factors. In recent years, empowered shareholders have had some encouraging successes as a result of writing proxy resolutions, or engaging with management to address a certain issue. There has also been the longer trend of individual and institution investors insisting that their portfolios not contradict their beliefs and values. This has forced mainstream money managers to figure out how to simultaneously make returns and acknowledge ethical concerns.  As a result of this continuing trend, an amazing thing has happened. Managers have learned that it is in their interest to promote responsibility in the market. Irresponsible corporate governance structures, disregard for the social environment, and abuse of the physical environment make for bad financial prospects in the long run. The dismal prospects for over-fished fisheries are a clichéd but good example. In the interest of market sustainability, managers have begun to take a proactive, if behind the scenes, approach to promoting corporate responsibility. The conference attendees were very excited about a recent 2008 report by the British Insurers Association that actually showed slightly higher returns in the long run for portfolios with environmental, social, governance (ESG) criteria. In addition to these questions of market sustainability, a panel of speakers from Innovest, Goldman Sachs, and Clear Bridge (an asset management company), addressed the idea that SRI funds have to compromise returns in the short run. Just like with any other type of fund, there are SRI funds that perform extremely well and there are SRI funds that perform poorly. Kevin Ng, a member of the Fundamental Equity Team of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, expressed Goldman Sachs’ interest in SRI initiatives and its ongoing engagement with management to promote responsibility. For the last year, Goldman Sachs has been offering investment vehicles to shareholders who want to capitalize on these initiatives.  A central theme of the conference was the crucial role of SRI as a part of fiduciary responsibility. Our trustees’ obligation to protect the long-term financial interests of the University is shared with the pioneers of the field, most notably churches and pension funds. Representatives from the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility explained how religious organizations were the first to pursue ethics in investing 40 years ago. Another speaker, Michael Musuraca, is a trustee of the New York City Retirement System (NYCERS), a pension fund that serves 125,000 NYC employees. This important fund has been investing responsibly since the 1980s and has a strong history of shareholder engagement. Also, our very own Connecticut state treasurer has been a proactive proponent of socially responsible investing. All of this information has been useful to the EAC. We are currently working on a proposal for the trustee working group for investor responsibility that would create a committee for investor responsibility here at Wesleyan. Please stay tuned for details and come to the WSA on Sunday nights as we work through the proposal for an investor responsibility committee."
"Not “disturbing”","2008-05-02","by John Kowalko,","The Wesleyan student community has always been known for its active engagement in helping those who need it. I do not understand how President Roth can say that the enlistment of students in protests for Physical Plant is “disturbing” (“Marching forward? Physical Plant workers protest in Usdan,” April 25, Volume CXLIII, Number 43). Roth seems to blame the union workers for rejecting a contract that was forced on their representatives by an administration that refuses to make reasonable compromises. These workers, most of whom work a second job, are merely trying to earn a livable wage. Perhaps he is lucky enough to have never been in a position that would allow him to understand this, but that is not an excuse for trying to dissuade student activism. I find his attitude not just disturbing, but thoroughly disappointing."
"University appoints new VP for Diversity","2008-05-02","by Rob Wohl, Staff Writer","Beginning this summer, President Michael Roth will be joined by another veteran of the California College of the Arts (CCA): Sonia BasSheva Mañjon. Dr. Mañjon will become the University’s first Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships. “I was impressed by Wesleyan’s history of diversity and the enthusiasm on the part of the students and faculty for civic engagement,” Mañjon said.  The Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships is a newly created position that will replace the Secretary of the University. The current Secretary of the University, Peter Patton, will continue in his other position as a professor of Earth & Environmental Sciences.  According to a University press release, Mañjon was hired to provide “leadership on civic engagement and cooperation with public and private organizations” and to “work with Wesleyan’s leadership team to attract, retain and inspire students, faculty and staff from groups currently under-represented on campus.” Mañjon will direct the University’s projects in the Middletown community, including the Green Street Arts Center and the Center for Community Partnerships. She will also act as the Affirmative Action Officer, oversee Public Safety and serve as a member of the president’s cabinet.  There will be some reorganization of the administration accompanying Mañjon’s arrival, but administrators indicate that, for the most part, staff will be moved into positions that are currently open. “It’s not like North College is changing dramatically,” said Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley. A committee was recently formed to assess and potentially reform student services. The committee, which includes Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts, Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Joe Bruno and Whaley will continue to meet over the summer. Other administrative changes will be announced by Whaley in the coming weeks. Mañjon was first introduced to the University when she attended President Roth’s inauguration in November. She will join the University’s administration on July 1. At CCA, Mañjon was the director of the Center for Art in Public Life and the co-chair of the College’s diversity initiatives. She characterizes the Center as similar to a combination of the University’s Green Street Arts Center and the Center for Community Partnerships. Mañjon also chaired the Diversity Studies Program and created the nation’s first BFA program in community arts. “Students look at how they as artists can make changes in society, specifically in social justice and diversity issues,” Mañjon said, explaining the community arts program.  She says this degree was created in response to a demand from students. So far the program has five graduates. However, Mañjon presently has no plans to create a similar program here at the University. “There’s a lot happening at Wesleyan already,” she said. “I’ll be meeting with various groups, including students, before I start trying to make changes to your environment.” Roth was the president of CCA while Mañjon was developing her program, and the two worked together throughout their tenure at CCA. Roth appointed Mañjon as soon as the position became open. No other candidates were considered for the position. “I am delighted to have Sonia join our efforts at Wesleyan,” Roth said in the University’s press release. “She is a tireless innovator with a very sophisticated sense of how to nurture existing relationships and create new partnerships with communities and constituencies of all sorts.”"
"Vote for Green candidates in  the Board of Trustees election","2008-05-06","by Nate Kaufman,","In November, President Roth signed the American College and University Presidents Climate Commitment, pledging the University to make a Climate Action Plan within two years’ time, a plan that will outline the University’s measures to decrease and eventually eliminate its greenhouse gas emissions. There has been movement towards this end—the creation of a Sustainability Committee, the drafting of a sustainability report card (in progress), and some great future campus policies and energy efficiency projects. It’s clear, however, that Wesleyan has not put in place the kind of financial backing or institutional structures necessary to meet President Roth’s pledge.  No one on campus—including the active members of the Sustainability Committee—has the expertise or the time to establish how we will become carbon neutral.  Sweeping changes need to happen on this campus in order for substantive progress to be made, including the hiring of at least one full-time employee devoted exclusively to sustainability. It is a matter of misguided prioritization, rather than financial constraints, that is obstructing progress on this front. An on-campus Director of Sustainability is as important as any staffer that the University employs currently, and in the realm of global citizenship, it is one of the most important positions that could—and should—exist. Which brings us to this month’s trustee election. One-third of the trustees on the board are elected by alumni—a group that now includes the class of 2008. And trustees have ultimate power over Wesleyan’s affairs. So I e-mailed each trustee candidate and asked them how they would address sustainability at Wesleyan, and whether or not they would support a Director of Sustainability. The most impressive responses I got were from David Sewell ’96 and Sidney Espinosa ’94. Both understand the great challenges before us, and perhaps most importantly, the fiscal resources that need to be allocated in order to do so.  Sewell, a lawyer, wrote, “Like financial aid and faculty recruitment and retention, environmental stewardship is vitally important to the school’s future (and the planet’s).  We have to find money for it.” He offered several suggestions for how to find such money, including alumni donations focused on sustainability, external funding and grants, and apportioning a percentage of student activities fees toward such efforts. “That, of course, would create a shortfall for other programs that would need to be addressed,” he wrote, “but it would have the benefit of giving current students the option to support these efforts and ’buy in’ to the broader goal of making Wes greener.”  Espinosa, who is the Director of Philanthropy at Hewlett-Packard, oversees “millions of dollars of investment in environmentally focused non-profits doing climate change research and environmental education around the world,” he wrote. He enthusiastically supports fundamental changes at Wesleyan in the areas of operations and institutional practices, departmental and curricular integration, and student programming and engagement. While he did not directly address the need to increase funding for sustainability, he supports the Director of Sustainability position and has helped implement environmental policies as a city councilman in Palo Alto, Calif.  Every trustee candidate responded to my email, and everyone showed a concern about environmental issues. Dr. Joe Haddad ’78, for example, who works in Central America, has “seen negative changes to the environment in my 20 years of travel to the region,” and supports actions taken by the University to act as an environmental steward, including looking at our endowment and supporting “companies and technologies with a demonstrated track record in sustainability.” Susan Sutherland ’82, Bill Macomber ’96 and Paul Mason ’77 all expressed interest in environmentalism at Wesleyan as well. Sutherland describes herself as “someone who often ’packs out’ my trash…and travels with a water bottle to fill up at water fountains so I don’t buy or use bottled water.” And while Mr. Mason did not give any details or ideas about these issues, he did offer, “If it means anything, I drive a hybrid.”  Please stay an active member of the Wesleyan community after you graduate, and support environmental sustainability at Wes and wherever else your life takes you. Keep the environment in mind when you vote for your three trustees of choice at http://www.wesleyan.edu/alumnitrustees, and make sure to vote before the May 25 deadline!"
"Asian American Studies falls under ‘Internationalization’","2008-05-06","by Melanie Cherng,","I am writing in response to the article entitled “Roth, faculty push for Middle Eastern studies in new initiatives,” which appeared in the March 28 issue of the Argus (Volume CXLIII, Number 35), in order to address President Roth’s interests in “[doubling] the number of international students on campus, as well as [developing] a Middle Eastern Studies Program.” These initiatives are a part of the administration’s efforts to “internationalize” Wesleyan so that students are prepared to engage in a diverse, globalized world.  I applaud the administration’s desire to enact institutional change. It is refreshing. But as the administration moves forward in the next few years in implementing initiatives that will “strengthen the undergraduate experience,” “internationalize” Wesleyan, inspire a “creative campus” and “civic engagement” (see Roth’s blog entry on Trustees and Themes for the Future), I would like to remind the University that internationalizing the Wesleyan curriculum and inspiring civic engagement in the Wesleyan student body necessitates the inclusion of Asian American Studies. As the United States becomes increasingly and inextricably linked to Asia, particularly China and India in foreign and economic relations, Asian American Studies becomes particularly relevant and essential.  A look at the current global issues affecting the United States—food shortages, oil crises, terrorism, the brain drain and outsourcing—all shape American attitudes towards Asian Americans.  If there is any doubt about this, simply remember how the American government treated Japanese Americans during World War II, attitudes during the Korean and Vietnam wars and the violence inflicted upon Arab Americans and South Asian Americans (particularly Sikhs) in the aftermath of 9/11. The simple truth is that the interactions between the U.S. and Asia abroad tellingly reflect how Asian Americans are treated at home. For example, whether an Asian American is considered American or a foreign Asian has consistently fluctuated in the past with American sentiment towards Asians abroad.  As soon as considering an Asian American as a foreigner becomes a possibility, the revoking of fundamental rights guaranteed to any U.S. citizen may follow dangerously at its heels. If the concerns, histories and cultures of Asian Americans were not the concerns of the rest of the American community before, they should be now. As Americans, it is our civic duty and responsibility to be well-informed and concerned about the treatment of fellow U.S. citizens.  As an educational institution that prides itself in diversity and activism, the University should provide the time, space and resources for the student to become well-informed about all communities in the United States, including the Asian American community. Not only should the University institutionalize Asian American studies because of the undeniable contribution Asian Americans have made to U.S. history, but also because the understanding of Asian American political history and culture is fundamental to preventing policy and legislation that will negatively impact the quality of life of American citizens and residents.  Wesleyan produces bright intellectuals and social activists in every graduating class who go on to shape policy in labor, education, immigration, law, etc. In order to develop policies and services that will positively support Americans from a diverse variety of backgrounds and experiences, it is fundamental that Wesleyan students are well-informed about the histories of the communities that have shaped the U.S.—including AA communities, whose histories and experiences are a vital and essential part of American history."
"Roth reaches out in first year","2008-05-06","by Hilary Moss, Editor-in-chief","In his first year as the University’s sixteenth president, Michael Roth invigorated the Wesleyan community with a series of new initiatives, while simultaneously becoming reacquainted with his alma mater that he left 30 years ago.  “I think the most important thing I had to do this year was to get to know the Wesleyan community, and so I spent a lot of time listening to students, faculty, staff, alumni and parents, about their perception of Wesleyan today and their hopes for Wesleyan in the future,” he said. “I’ve probably had hundreds of meetings…all over the country to learn about where Wesleyan is now and what its greatest challenges are and where the opportunities lie.” One of Roth’s chief achievements was reviewing faculty input to create a series of five themes that will be implemented in the fall: strengthening the undergraduate experience, internationalization, the “creative campus,” College of the Environment and civic engagement. For the last few weeks, faculty and staff have been meeting on five committees addressing each of the topics. “They’ve all been working on identifying proposals and establishing a framework for budget planning, so by commencement I think we’ll have reports from each of these groups,” Roth explained. “University strategic planning can often take years. We tried to do it in a more focused, quicker way, and I’m delighted it’s gone as well as it has.” Roth said that he also hopes to enhance the co-curricular components of student life. Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley and Vice President for Academic Affairs and Provost Joe Bruno have been discussing ways to connect academics with activities outside of the classroom. “It has been stimulating to work with [Roth] because he has a range of ideas, but is very willing to listen to the ideas of others,” Bruno said. “He also applies a healthy skepticism to conversations of this type, because he wants to understand proposals fully and to know that the speaker has thought carefully about his or her ideas.” In perhaps what is his most significant initiative, Roth announced in November that beginning with the class of 2012, first-year students whose total family income is less than $40,000 per year will receive grants as opposed to loans. All other students on financial aid will graduate with a four-year total loan indebtedness reduced by an average of 35 percent. This will cost the university $3.2 million each year. According to Roth, more students are matriculating who need financial aid.  “In a sense, that’s good because they see Wesleyan as giving robust financial aid and that’s what we were hoping for,” he said. “Fundraising for it is coming along nicely, but there’s a lot more to do. For a school with our size endowment, in order to do that kind of financial aid, we really need to continue to grow our endowment so we can continue giving to students in the future.” Director of Financial Aid Jennifer Lawton said that Roth’s new loan initiative has received strong support from alums, the Board of Trustees and donors. “The hope is to reduce packaged loan debt even more in the future and with the interest shown by donors, I think this will become a reality,” she said.  Roth has also focused his energies on fundraising, especially for the endowment. “With turmoil in financial markets it’s been a difficult year for a lot of people,” he said. “I think the plan from the Board [of Trustee]’s perspective was that in the first year of a president’s tenure you don’t want to have to depend on the president to raise a lot of money from big donors. After all, he or she doesn’t know them yet, but in this case we had to raise money because we needed it for both financial aid and for the facilities projects.” He said that so far the University has received several million-dollar gifts from first-time donors, although the total amount made through fundraising cannot be reported until the end of the fiscal year.  A bulk of the fundraising money will also go to the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, to be housed in the former Davision Campus Center building and slated to open in the fall of 2009, and the new Molecular Life and Sciences complex, which is tentatively projected for completion in 2015. As part of watching the University’s cash flow, Roth also asked each of his administrative officials to cut his or her department’s budget. “I think when you spend money it should be very clearly connected to education and the further away it gets from education, teaching and scholarship, the harder it is to justify the expenditure,” Roth said. “I asked each cabinet member to reduce the budget in their area. We didn’t make all of the cuts. We want to make the ones that don’t have an impact on education.” Wesleyan Student Assembly President Matt Ball ’08 thinks Roth has also made an impact by increasing the visibility of the president on campus. “Students have a personal relationship with him and feel like they can relate to him in a way that’s quite rare on college campuses,” Ball said. “There are obviously other more concrete things, but to me his most notable achievement is his responsiveness.” Roth noted that although he travels during the weekends, he typically spends a lot of time on campus.  “Going to lots of stuff on campus has been exciting,” he said. “I’m just trying to be more open through office hours and the blog, answering e-mails and meeting people outside of office hours. I want to give Wesleyan students the feeling that they can talk to the president about issues that matter to them.” Roth could also be seen in the classroom this year as the professor of a Film Studies’ course “The Past on Film.” “Teaching has been a delight,” he said. “I’ve enjoyed it tremendously.” Next year, Roth will continue to keep his office door open, garnering more input from members of the University community. He also hopes to become a better communicator. “Sometimes I speak informally,” he said. “I suppose I should be more prudent.” Vice President and Secretary of the University Peter Patton expressed that it is important to remember that it is Roth’s first year in the position. “He’s going to be a great Wesleyan president…I think he’s accessible and willing to engage in conversation with everybody about everything,” Patton said. “He is passionate about Wesleyan and its mission and he’s just getting started. It takes a while to get under way here. His major accomplishments will be in upcoming years.“"
"WSA gathers students in Usdan for forum on Fountain","2008-05-16","by Mollie Laffin-RoseIsabella Vitti, Editor-in-Chief and Wespeaks Editor","The Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) facilitated an all-campus forum on Friday afternoon in response to the incidents of Friday morning. A large crowd of students packed the first floor of the Usdan University Center for what became an almost two-hour long conversation about what exactly took place several hours earlier. President-Elect of the WSA Mike Pernick ’10 opened the forum with a note of anger and resolve that seemed to resonate with students. “I just want to say that I’m really appalled,” he said. “I’m shocked. We never want this to happen again.” Pernick thanked the administration for its responsiveness throughout the day, including President Michael Roth, Director of Public Safety Dave Meyer and Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley. Whaley was in attendance; Meyer could not attend because of a prior engagement. Roth had held a meeting with concerned students earlier in the day in the basement of South College. “They’ve really gone out of their way to be open about this,” Pernick said. Vice President-Elect of the WSA Saul Carlin ’09 read several e-mailed statements from students who were not able to attend the forum, then Izaak Orlansky ’08, former coordinator of the WSA, opened the floor to comments and questions from students. Josh Ente ’08 spoke first, asking if there was a representative from Public Safety present who could explain the office’s policies regarding social events.  Orlansky said that although it was important to ask questions such as these to the administration, the forum was intended primarily to be a space for students’ voices. Whaley did speak several times in response to comments or questions about University policies, first offering solidarity with the student body. “I have as many questions about what happened last night as you do,” he said. “Like all of you, I’m still trying to figure it all out.” Liat Olenick ’08 inquired as to the Middletown Police Department’s (MPD) authorization to be on campus.  Whaley responded that although he agrees that the department’s presence on campus has increased over the past several years, rumors that MPD were at one time not allowed on campus are untrue. He said that MPD presence has increased in part because the University has requested more assistance after a surge in student assaults and thefts. The scene became emotional at times, as students offered testimonials of their experiences with pepper spray bullets, taser guns and interactions with police officers. Andrew Price ’09, one of five University students who was arrested, recounted being chased by an officer and canine, followed into a student house, and attacked by the dog. “It was the most terrifying thing I have ever experienced,” Price said. “And I don’t understand why, with 30 of his colleagues on the street, this man needed a canine to come and bite me in the head to take me into the police station.” Leslie Prado ’08 said that when she approached an officer after the pepper spray bullets had been shot to ask for an explanation, he responded by threatening, “Do you want to get arrested?” “I felt very voiceless last night,” Prado said. “I want to have a voice.” Dionne Anderson ’10 said that this was not the first instance of Public Safety Officers disrespecting students. “I’m tired of being belittled,” Anderson said. “I will not stand for it anymore. I am not a target. I’m a human being.” Ron Bernstein P’11 expressed his concerns both as a parent of a University student who was shot with pepper spray and as a lawyer who represents a major police department. “This whole group is radicalized against the police,” Bernstein said.  “That’s not what the police want.” Looking towards resolutions, students agreed that much of the problem lies in poor communication and poor town-gown relations. “The issue has always been communication,” said Jake Greenberg ’08, who suggested that the University set up different committees to gather information about yesterday’s incidents and improve dialogue with the MPD. Maya Barros-Odin ’10 encouraged the crowd to strive for a more inclusive Middletown community. “I think that certainly as a Wesleyan community we have strength,” Barros-Odin said. “But I think that we would have greater strength if we worked as a Middletown community, together.”  Mark Kelley ’08 suggested that students maintain a positive attitude during the next several weeks. “It’s important for us to act like the adults we want to be treated like,” Kelley said. “Don’t be resentful. Rise above it.” Similarly, Alex Gelman ’08 offered a positive approach to a tense situation. “I’ve honestly never been prouder to be a Wesleyan student than I am right now,” Gelman said. “[The police] dehumanized us. We have to remember that they’re people, too. We can’t take that dehumanization and that barbarity and turn that back on them. We have to respond with love.” In offering closing thoughts, both Pernick and Whaley encouraged students to e-mail first-hand accounts of the morning’s incidents to the administration and the WSA. Pernick encouraged continuing community and conversation, and Whaley promised that the administration would find answers to the many lingering questions."
"Obama encourages public service in commencement address","2008-05-25","by Matt Connolly, Miriam Leshin, Editors-in-Chief","In his commencement address, Senator Barack Obama (D-IL) directly challenged the class of 2008 to commit themselves to community involvement and global engagement. Obama filled in for Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA), whose recent diagnosis with a malignant brain tumor prevented him from speaking at the event. Addressing the 10,000 seated audience members, as well as a packed Foss Hill, Obama spoke on Kennedy’s intended topic of service to one’s country. “At a time of war, we need you to work for peace,” he said. “At a time of inequality, we need you to work for opportunity. At a time of so much cynicism and so much doubt, we need you to make us believe again. That’s your task, class of 2008.” This call to public service was a theme throughout Sunday’s 176th Commencement. President Michael Roth similarly implored the 737 undergraduates and 100 graduate students to push for positive change in an increasingly troubling world. “This year’s graduates, like Wesleyan alumni before you, will contribute to shaping our culture in the future, because otherwise it will be shaped by people for whom creativity and change, freedom and equality, diversity and tolerance, are much too threatening,” Roth said. “We are counting on you to help shape our culture, so that it will not be shaped by forces of oppression and violence.” Obama drew on his experiences as a community organizer in the South Side of Chicago to illuminate the difficulties of public service, while still assuring graduates of their potential to make change. “Should you take the path of service, should you choose to take up one of these causes as your own, know that you’ll experience frustrations and failures,” he said. “Even your successes will be marked by imperfections and unintended consequences…But I hope you’ll remember, during those times of doubt and frustration, that there is nothing naïve about your impulse to change the world.” Audience members excitedly praised Obama’s oratory skill and challenging message. “His call to graduates and all of us to live lives underscored by service to others is probably the best thing to say to young people in particular,” said Chair of the English department Ann duCille. “Having come of age in the 1960s, in a moment in history when we thought we would change the world, it means a lot to me and others of my generation to hear of change not just spoken, because that’s just rhetoric, but felt in the air.” Ben Nwachukwu, who attended commencement to see friend Justin Douglas ’08 graduate, also enjoyed both the delivery and substance of Obama’s speech. “His message was about reaching out to our community, to young students everywhere,” he said. “He’s like a rock star everywhere he goes. It was just cool to be in his presence.” Obama remained present after giving his speech, and individually shook each graduate’s hand as they processed onstage. Despite on-campus excitement for Obama’s appearance, multiple speakers expressed regret for Kennedy’s absence. After his May 17 hospitalization, the University was unsure if Kennedy would still be able to deliver the commencement address. On May 22, however, the University announced that Obama would be filling in for Kennedy as a personal favor. Kennedy’s stepdaughter, Caroline Raclin ’08, was among the graduates. His son, Edward Kennedy Jr. ’83, celebrated his 25th class reunion over the weekend. Senator Kennedy’s wife, Victoria Reggie Kennedy and son, Congressman Patrick Joseph Kennedy also attended Sunday’s ceremony. In his address, Obama praised Kennedy’s public service record, which includes improving healthcare and health insurance, raising minimum wage, and strengthening public education. He called on the graduates to take inspiration from Kennedy’s many achievements. “Surely, if one man can achieve so much and make such a difference in the lives of so many, then each of us can do our part,” he said. “Surely, if his service and his story can forever shape America’s story, then our collective service can shape the destiny of this generation. At the very least, his living example calls us to try.” Adrienne Shea ’08 found Obama’s references to Kennedy’s legacy effective. “I thought it was classy that he incorporated Ted Kennedy’s themes, but used his own experiences to elaborate on that,” she said. Once Obama agreed to replace Kennedy, the University had less than four days to orchestrate the arrival a high profile speaker on campus. After the University met with multiple law enforcement agencie—ncluding the Middletown Police Department, Connecticut State Police and the United States Secret Servic—t was decided that several changes would be made to the event to ensure safety. While commencement is traditionally an open event, this year graduates’ guests were allotted 10 tickets for the priority seating on Andrus Field. Foss Hill, however, offered first-come, first-serve spots on the grass. Onlookers also flocked to standing areas in front of Usdan and College Row. Almost a mile of gated fence cordoned off the graduates and their guests from surrounding spectators, according to Associate Vice President for Facilities Joyce Topshe. Secret Service agents screened all graduates and media personne—hich ranged from The Hartford Courant to The New York Times to Fox New—efore they could gain access to their allotted areas on Andrus Field. Additionally, several agents stood watch on the roofs of Olin Library and Zelnick Pavilion. Despite the increased security and national attention, a sense of humor and lightheartedness was felt throughout the ceremony. The student Taiko Drumming Ensemble performed the processional and recessional music, their thunderous, percussion-heavy sound providing a lively alternative to the sober “Pomp and Circumstance” traditionally chosen for graduation ceremonies.  Roth welcomed the audience with a simple declaration. “Wesleyan, you are very cool,” Roth said to open the ceremony. Senior Class President Rashida Richardson ’08 began her speech by referencing the common mix-up between Wesleyan University and Wellesley College. This was recently brought up when Fox News erroneously joked that Obama was speaking at Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton’s (D-NY) alma mater Wellesley. “Today, we step out of this bubble we call Wellesley,” she said. Richardson continued this tone throughout her address, closing with a sly reference to the homogeneity of Wesleyan post-grad destinations. “I look forward to seeing y’all when we move to New York,” she said. After receiving an honorary degree, President of Williams College Morton Schapiro poked fun at both the event’s heightened security and the rivalry between Williams and Wesleyan. “I bet you had no idea that the president of Williams traveled with so much Secret Service,” he said. Other recipients of honorary degrees included Obama, author Jamaica Kincaid and photographer and retired lawyer Philip Trager ’56. Additionally, Professor of Religion Elizabeth McAlister, Professor of Letters Howard Needler and Professor of History and African American Studies Renee Romano were all awarded Binswanger Prizes for Excellence in Teaching. The University also recognized several retiring faculty members: Adjunct Professor of German Studies Vera Grant, Professor of English and African American Studies Gayle Pemberton, Professor of English Richard Slotkin and Professor of Biology Jason Wolfe. According to commencement updates on the University website, Obama’s appearance was not part of his political campaign. In his speech, however, Obama explicitly pointed to some of his presidential campaign’s proposals. “As President, I intend to grow the Foreign Service, double the Peace Corps over the next few years, and engage the young people of other nations in similar programs…” he said. While reactions to the speech were overwhelmingly positive, some members in the audience, like Joanna Mayo P ’08, still found Obama’s direct references to his political campaign unsettling. “It was a great speech,” Mayo said. “I was a little disappointed when it turned into a stump speech, but other than that it was good.” Inslee Coddington ’10 echoed Mayo’s sentiments, adding that such references were unnecessary. “I can’t say I was surprised at all, but I was kind of disappointed,” she said. “I think he could’ve had the same message and used the same anecdotes without actually saying, ’As president, I will…’” Some reasoned, however, that not only were certain supposedly political parts of Obama’s speech inevitable, but they were also harmless. “You can’t deny that he’s running for president,” said Hilary Burke ’10. “But he did only mention the class of 2008 three times.” “I got nervous when he talked about the presidency,” Shea said. “But he was just using his background and experience to talk about service to our country.” Overall, however, commencement attendees were pleased with Obama’s appearance. “I think it was a phenomenal culmination of the Wesleyan experience to have Barack Obama come and speak,” said Patrick Senat ’08. Nate Kaufman ’08 reflected that though he is unsure of his post-graduate plans, he hopes to apply Obama’s message to his future endeavors. “I’ll service my community,” he said with a smile."
"2007-2008: Know your news","2008-08-29","by Suzanna Hirsch, News Editor","For those students just joining us, and for those who simply need a refresher, here’s a look back at some of the news highlights from`\t last year: * A not-so Bon Appetit: Campus optimism for new food provider Bon Appetit wavered in the early weeks of the fall semester, when members of Unite Here! Local 217, the University food service worker’s union, accused the company of violating the union’s contract. Many students expressed solidarity with the dining workers, who maintained that Bon Appetit was attempting to cut workers’ hours and benefits. Ultimately, the company and the union reached a settlement near the end of spring semester. *Usdan boycott: Riding a wave of complaints surrounding the recently-opened University Center (and perhaps feeling an accompanying nostalgia for former dining hall Mocon), about 100 students gathered in Usdan in September to stage a small-scale boycott against the new facility. Former Bon Appetit Resident District Manager Delmar Crim listened to the protesters as they voiced complaints about high food prices, long lines, and unfair treatment of workers. While many questioned the boycott’s effectiveness, Bon Appetit did implement several changes—such as the option of using meals, rather than strictly points, to pay for lunch—when spring semester rolled around. *Science Center site selection: In early October, a final location was chosen for the new $160 million Molecular and Life Sciences building. While some praised the effort to unite the sciences with the rest of campus, others mourned the imminent demolition of Shanklin Laboratory—one of the oldest buildings on campus—prompting a widely joined Facebook group, “The Save Shanklin Campaign.” *Cocktails cause chaos: The second installment of a broadly cherished campus tradition, Senior Cocktails, was cancelled after bad behavior at the first event in October. Senior fun was spoiled for all when several students verbally abused the bus driver transporting the class to the off-campus soiree. The driver was also reportedly physically assaulted, and alcohol containers and illegal drugs were also left scattered around the bus.  *Robin Williams draws laughs: 200 lucky students enjoyed an hour of comedy when Robin Williams spoke in the Memorial Chapel. Tickets for the Beta-sponsored charity event sold out a mere two hours after going on sale. *Surveillance for safety: In December, Public Safety (PSafe) proposed placing security cameras around campus to prevent theft and illegal activity. While PSafe assured students that the cameras were put in place to protect, not persecute, them, many worried they could potentially be used to catch under-aged drinkers. While some new cameras were installed on campus, the issue remains under discussion. *Diner delights: Students and Middletown natives alike enjoyed omelettes, pancakes, and other favorite dishes when O’Rourke’s Diner reopened in February. The Main Street hotspot, which had burned down a year and a half earlier, remains a cherished example of positive town-gown relations—not to mention a must-stop for delicious cuisine. *Less Times to go around: Due to WSA funding issues and increased per-paper cost, the New York Times Readership Program, which supplies the free newspapers seen around campus, seemed temporarily in jeopardy last year. While the number of papers on campus was ultimately reduced, the program remains intact, leaving readers and crossword puzzle-doers alike with an adequate Times fix. *Zonker Harris party prohibition: The end of February may have brought sun and clear skies closer in view, but it also coincided with a controversial announcement: Zonker Harris Day, a treasured WesFest weekend celebration, would go unfunded if the name was not changed. Administration expressed concern that the name—stemming from a stoner character in the famed “Doonesbury” comic strip—would inspire unwanted drug activity. Students begrudgingly obliged, and the festival remained practically unchanged under the equally witty title, ’Ze Who Must Not Be Named Day.’” *Spring breaking for a cause: While others relaxed in beach-filled locales, about 30 University students joined forces with over 100 students nationwide to protest the War in Iraq. Eight members of the Wesleyan group, titled Our Spring Break, were arrested at the Washington D.C. march. (See article on page XX) *Surprising campus crimes: The campus community received some alarming e-mails last April, following two on-campus student muggings in a 24-hour period. Public Safety advised students on how to stay alert and collaborated with the Middletown Police Department to help the somewhat shaken campus community feel more at ease in its generally secure home. *More contract woes: Students and staff joined members of Physical Plant in a high profile campus march to draw attention to the Physical Plant workers’ contract issues. While the workers felt they were loosing money, higher-ups claimed negotiations remained unproblematic. In any case, campus dwellers soon became accustomed to hearing students and workers alike chanting “No contract, no work, no peace.” *Fountain fiasco: In an end of the year celebration gone wrong, five students were arrested when Public Safety and the Middletown Police Department began forcibly clearing Fountain Avenue of partying undergrads after repeatedly demanding students move away from the street. Charges ranged from disorderly conduct and assault on a police officer to inciting a riot, while police drew criticism for using pepper spray, dogs, and taser guns on the crowd. *Barack rocked commencement: When the tragic news of Senator Ted Kennedy’s brain tumor was released, seniors were left not only saddened by the senator’s illness, but also without a commencement speaker. Just days before commencement was scheduled to occur, however, students received word that they would be getting a high profile replacement. As they walked down the aisle, graduates were greeted not only by President Roth, but by now-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama."
"David Harris Remembered","2008-09-05","by Matt Connolly, Editor-In-Chief","An estimated 500 people, including many within the Wesleyan community, came together last month to celebrate the life of David Lynn Harris, Jr. ’08, who died in a hiking accident in Oregon last July. Both at the service and in interviews with The Argus, family and friends shared memories and offered reflections about Harris, whom they praised for his boundless curiosity, social awareness and the unwavering empathy he expressed to everyone he knew. “Dave was able to establish a genuine connection with a number of different people,” said friend Mike Berger ’08 in an interview. “The depth of Dave’s personhood and his absolute caring and sincerity led him to touch alot of people in a very deep way.” The August 14 service, held at the New York Culture Center in Manhattan, took place three weeks after Harris’s body was found on Neahkahnie Mountain, along the Oregon Coast, on July 24. According to an August 10 article in The Oregonian, a five-foot long and one-foot wide tree branch was found near Harris’s body. An autopsy later showed that Harris died of head injuries most likely caused by the falling branch.  Harris had moved to Portland after graduating in May, briefly taking a job as a call receiver for the American Automobile Association (AAA) before leaving what he found to be unsatisfying work. A nature-lover since youth, he decided to backpack both on and around the Neahkahnie. Those close to him characterized the trip as a time of both external exploration and inward reflection. Many admitted that the sudden and seemingly random nature of Harris’s death added another layer of confusion and anger to their grieving process. Fellow members of the class of 2008, in particular, emphasized the disorienting effect of the tragedy, which some said was the first time a friend their age had passed away. “You hear about things like this, but this is the first time in my life I’ve experienced it, and it has felt so useless and unfair,” said friend Max Rose ’08 in an interview. “He deserved to live a long and prosperous life. He never hurt a soul.” Jean Pockrus ’08, a friend, regretfully admitted in an interview that ze was so emotionally overwhelmed by Harris’s death that ze could not bring hirself to attend the service. Pockrus added that Harris’s devotion to working towards social justice and equality, particularly for children, gave his passing a tragic air of unfulfilled promise. “That’s why his death is devastating, because he would have done so many good things,” ze said. “He was already accomplished in so many ways.” Although somber thoughts and emotions inevitably shaded individual accounts of  Harris’s death, those who knew him ultimately emphasized his exemplary personal qualities and accomplishments, many of which were notable from an early age. Friends and educators from both of the Hunter College Campus Schools in Manhattan, which Harris attended and graduated from in 2004, noted Harris’s intellectual inquisitiveness and musical prowess on the bass, his instrument of choice. He developed his playing skills through private lessons and concert performances in connection with the Music Advancement Program within Juilliard. A passion for the outdoors was also fostered through involvement with the Boy Scouts.  Harris’s extracurricular achievements were often discussed in relation to his ever-continuing personal development. Daniel Scavalone, who quickly became friends with Harris after they met in 11th grade history class, noted Harris’s academic and musical achievements in high school, as well as his burgeoning sense of social responsibility and community awareness. “He helped me realize that you don’t judge your country by its wealth and prestige, but by how they treat its poor,” Scavalone said at the service. Such concerns would continue to remain on Harris’s mind when he came to the University. He majored in government, and continued to play the bass, but his most well-known work outside the classroom may have been his involvement with the Traverse Square Afterschool Program.  His involvement lasted for almost his entire four years at the University, and was even integrated into his final moments at the University. Harris, Berger, Alex Diamond ’08 and Zac Meyer ’08 organized a boycott of the mandatory purchasing of graduation gowns. Over 50 graduates participated, and the $1,800 in total saved funds was donated to the program instead. The shirt Harris chose to wear speaks to both his societal engagement and love of music, reading: “Make Hip-Hop, Not War.” Harris introduced Berger to the program during second semester of their sophomore year, and Berger stayed with the program until the day he graduated. He reminisced about how Harris would bring in comic books to give to the children, and speculated about why “the Center,” as members affectionately refer to the program’s base of operations within the Traverse Square housing units, first intrigued Harris. “I think Dave was drawn to Traverse Square by the energy that radiates from the Center, as we call it,” Berger said. “It comes from the community of Traverse Square through the children. We, the people who work at Traverse Square, feed off of that.” More than any individual accomplishment, however, friends recalled Harris’s calm, warm personality and seemingly limitless interest in the world and, more specifically, the people around him. Lauren Goldman ’08, a friend, commented in an interview on the range of topics she and Harris had discussed since first meeting in the Butterfields freshman year: from gender mores in India to advice on personal dilemmas. No matter how often they talked, Goldman added, there still always seemed to be something else to discuss. “He had so much to say,” Goldman said. “You could say whatever you wanted to say to him. We always had so much to catch up on, because when you feel as if you can talk to someone about anything, you do have a lot to catch up on.” Farrell Evans, who had been Harris’s mentor within a program connected to “Sports Illustrated” and who spoke at the service, similarly marveled at David’s ability to speak comfortably with people from all walks of life, a trait many commented upon. “David could talk to a Harlem wino and a sixth generation Harvard investment banker,” Evans said with a laugh. During the first semester of his senior year, Harris pursued a growing interest in Buddhism and eastern philosophy by studying abroad in India. He spent time in Bodhgaya, the site where the Buddha is said to have attained enlightenment. Friends say the semester provided Harris with the next step along a journey that many define as spiritual in nature. “It may sound corny, because we don’t have the words to describe what David was doing,” Pockrus said. “He didn’t go abroad to India to consume stereotypes about Indian culture. He went because it was the birthplace of a philosophy that was very dear to him and that he was very intellectually engaged by.” Rose added that he saw a distinct shift within Harris, reflective of a continuing personal exploration. “Especially when he came back from India, you can see in his eyes that he was at peace with the world,” Rose said. “He was someone who was constantly searching. He was searching for his destiny.” Buddhist tradition played a critical role in the memorial ceremony itself. The Culture Center is run by Soka Gakkai International—USA (SGI-USA), an organization based in the teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. During the ceremony, individuals were invited to approach the front of the room and place a pinch of incense in a burner—an expression of gratitude for the dead in Nichiren Buddhist tradition. (The main gathering space housed 300 people, while 200 additional individuals watched the ceremony on simulcast video in an accompanying room.)  Guests were also asked to participate in the rhythmic chanting of the invocation “Nam Myoho Renge Kyo,” the Japanese translation of the title of the “Lotus Sutra,” a religious text believed by followers of Nichiren Buddhism to contain the ultimate truth of Buddhism. Despite the personal nature of his time in India, Harris also managed to share his experiences with those he cared about in a multitude of ways. Justin Michael Douglas ’08, a friend, recalled in an interview that Harris gave him a red scroll with a drawing of Ganesha, a Hindu deity said to be a giver of wealth. “He knew I was an economics major and was all about wealth,” Douglas said with a laugh. “I sat under it during phone interviews for jobs.” Goldman remembered receiving mass e-mails from Harris in India, sharing his adventures and discoveries with those back home. “He had experiences with monks, and he wrote about bicycling through rice paddies and meeting all these people,” Goldman said. “He just had an incredible love for where he was: the sights and sounds and tastes of new things he was experiencing.” Even those who did not know Harris particularly well, however, sensed his genuine thirst for emotional and spiritual progression. Adjunct Associate Professor of Music Jay Hoggard admitted at the service that, though he was on the program to speak, he did not know Harris particularly well.  However, he recalled a conversation he had with Harris right before commencement last May, which he reiterated in an interview. Hoggard ruefully chuckled as he reflected on his initial reaction to Harris’s ambitious views on the future. “The first question he asked me was, ’Mr. Hoggard, how can I focus music to be a positive spiritual influence in the universe?’” Hoggard said. “And my first thought was, ’What are you going to do when you graduate? Do you have a job?’” Hoggard admired Harris’s forthright nature and desire to expand his talent on an almost cosmic sense. “I thought that was a pretty amazing conversation to have with a young fellow who was ready to jump out there,” Hoggard said. “It wasn’t a standard conversation about getting the job on Wall Street and making the big bucks.” This constant striving for meaningful connection and serious personal introspection points to the legacy Harris has left amongst those closest to him. It was perhaps all too fitting, then, that David once posted a single quote within his on-campus living space for all to see.  It read simply: “Today I will realize my highest truth.”"
"ODC/Dance performs and teaches while on campus","2008-09-05","by Benjamin Firke, Contributing Writer","A woman lies crumpled on the floor in her best evening gown. A man stands over her. He tries to lift her up in his arms, but she twists out of his grasp and falls to the ground. The man tries to lift her again, but she eludes his grasp for a second time, dancing away into a corner. He removes his tie and lunges for her. This time, the woman rolls away from her pursuant and watches, smirking, as he drops to the floor; he is now the one lying prostrate.  What is the scene? A dinner party gone horribly wrong? No—Anne Zivolich and Brandon “Private” Freeman (a former Army National Guard officer) are performing with ODC/Dance at the CFA Theatre. “Private” is not a typical nickname for a professional dancer, but then again, ODC/Dance is anything but a typical dance company. Founded at Oberlin College in 1971, ODC relocated to the Bay Area in 1976 and has become one of the most successful performance troupes in the region. Still artistic directed by founder Brenda Way after 37 years, the group specializes in an iconoclastic style that is both intellectual and physical. Wesleyan was lucky enough to host them for seven days this July as part of an initiative by the Center for the Arts.  ODC/Dance arrived in Middletown on July 4 for a week-long residency during which the performers worked with the Wesleyan Summer Programs’ Center for Creative Youth (CCY) in an intimate workshop setting. Photography students were allowed to bring their cameras to rehearsals and capture the movement of the dancers on film. The dance students received master classes on the same pieces that ODC performs at their theater in San Francisco. All students in the program attended a talk in which members of the company expounded on the creative process.  Finally, the residency culminated in performances on July 10-11 as ODC/Dance brought its signature hybrid of ballet and modern styles to the CFA Theater. The group presented four pieces before a highly receptive audience of CCY and other summer school students, Middletown residents and local youth groups. “24 Exposures” began the evening. Way choreographed this piece to a recording composed by Edgar Myer and played by a string ensemble featuring Yo-Yo Ma. The work showcased the entire company of 10 dancers onstage against a brightly colored backdrop that changed between pink, orange and teal. The dancers wore equally colorful tights and leotards and spent the better part of 20 minutes showcasing their leaping skills in powerful yet graceful jumps.  The troupe then fractured into a series of small groups, each performing their own individual routines. The rush of color and movement in “24 Exposures” lacked the cohesion and thematic weight of the following three pieces and for all of the dancers’ effortless movement, the first routine allowed the audience to lose attention too easily.  However, the final image of the piece was breathtaking and expressed the ethos of ODC/Dance clearer than any press release: three female dancers, each held in the air in ascending order, formed a freeze-framed picture of a woman taking flight.  “Shenanigans,” choreographed by former CCY dance department chair KT Nelson, featured Zivolich and Freeman in a hormonally charged and comic piece set to a jaunty Darius Milhaud piano score. The two performed against a black backdrop amidst gold lighting, wearing formal evening wear—a tuxedo and a party dress suitable for waltzing, not a high-energy romp. But the music and costumes made for a dissonant juxtaposition with the choreography, which featured sly innuendo and floor-writhing in-between the twirls and jumps. The performers made it clear that wit, not just athleticism, is a key component of the ODC aesthetic.  For “Unintended Consequences: A Meditation,” the stage was set with grids of white fluorescent light fixtures reminiscent of the work of minimalist artist Dan Flavin. Way’s choreography was set to various songs by Laurie Anderson, including “O Superman,” a song which includes a main musical motif of the word “Ha” repeated over and over.  Though the song had little variation in dynamics, rhythm or melody, the dancers struck simple yet dynamic poses which made the song’s mournful tone all the more poignant—the sight of a figure stretching out their arms as if in flight and then crumpling to the floor conveyed a mournful commentary on the hubris of America’s foreign policy in the Middle East.  The evening concluded with Nelson’s “Walk Before Talk,” which featured eight dancers. After an hour and a half of movement the company refused to let up, and the piece had possibly the highest energy level of the night. A reverse of the reflective tone of “Unintended Consequences,” the finale proved to live up to its title.  Dressed in firey colors and set against a sunset-like backdrop, the company threw themselves about the stage in the most passionate explosion of movement that night. The performance played like a more seamless and concentrated version of “24 Exposures,” as the company used its powerful kicks and fluid arms to give the audience a final jolt.  When the performance was over, the dancers were covered in sweat. But their smart and passionate work—as well as their willingness to teach during their residency—proved that the University’s CFA is just as vibrant in the summer as during the academic year."
"Teraguchi to leave post in early October","2008-09-09","by Andrea Domanick, News Editor","In the wake of this summer’s bureaucratic reshuffling, it was announced on Friday that Dean for Diversity and Student Engagement Danny Hiroyuki Teraguchi will leave the University at the beginning of October. Teraguchi has worked at the University since 2006. According to an all-campus e-mail from Vice President of Student Affairs Michael J. Whaley, Teraguchi will take a position at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore, Md., focusing on quality of student diversity at the school. Teraguchi announced his departure to the administration several weeks ago. The position was particularly desirable for Teraguchi, as his wife lives and works in nearby Washington, D.C.  “I’m thrilled that he’ll be able to knit his personal and work lives together,” Whaley wrote in a separate e-mail. “I imagine that it has not been easy for him to be away living and working from his wife.” Taraguchi’s duties will be taken over by Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnership Sonia Manjon until Teraguchi’s successor is determined. Manjon’s current responsibilities include directing the University’s projects in Middletown, such as the Green Street Arts Center, working as Affirmative Action Officer, overseeing Public Safety and serving as member of President Michael Roth’s cabinet.  “After he let me know that he would be leaving, I met with Vice President Manjon to discuss the position and we agreed that we should align the position with her portfolio since her work focuses on institutional diversity initiatives,” Whaley said. “This realignment means that she will be conducting the search, and that Dean Danny’s successor will report to her rather than to me.” Whaley admits that taking on Teraguchi’s work after his departure will not be an easy task, and that his impact on the University’s community will not be forgotten. “It has been really amazing to work closely with Danny over these past two years, and I will certainly miss him,” Whaley said."
"Mytheos’ misrepresentation","2008-09-12","by Freddie deBoer,","I’ve never felt compelled before to write in to the Argus, but I feel there are many misconceptions and half-truths in Mytheos Holt’s latest column (“Mytheology: Where is your Vanguard Now?,” September 9, 2008, Volume CXLIV, Number 3) on the incidents at Fountain Avenue that occurred last May. My father was a professor at Wesleyan for over 30 years [Professor of Theater Fredrik deBoer], and I grew up on campus, so I have some insight into both the college and the community. Holt’s portrayal of Middletown and its relationship with Wesleyan are both flatly wrong. Despite Holt’s implication that there is a contrast between liberal Wesleyan and conservative Middletown, Middletown is an extremely liberal community by any standards. Middletown is a Democratic stronghold in perhaps the bluest state in the country. Middletown was a union town before the manufacturing industry collapsed in the state, and remains a very diverse, progressive community. The town has a proud record of service to minorities and to the protection and support of artists and nonconformists, as a little basic research into the legal and municipal history of Middletown would demonstrate. Holt might also be served by doing a little research into the socioeconomic status of Middletown, which would contradict his notion that Middletown is a poor community. I take it, though, that research is not Holt’s forte. What’s more, Holt’s portrayal of the police doesn’t fit the reality. Holt says that the conflict at Fountain Avenue was really about class conflict and resentment from the “proletarian” police towards the affluent Wesleyan students. Setting aside the fact that Marxist orthodoxy would never regard police officers of any stripe as proletarian, the average Middletown Police officer earns more than the national median income. All of them have college degrees. If Holt actually got to know some of them, rather than rendering them as crude stereotypes, he would learn that very many of them are in fact liberal, and quite accepting of nonconformists. They do have uniformly low opinions of people who break the law. The fact of the matter is, Holt’s portrayal of a simmering “town versus gown” conflict is simply fantasy. I, like many Middletown residents, am indeed very often irritated by the way in which some Wesleyan students tend to view Middletown as a playground. But that is genuinely as far as this conflict is taken: irritation. Again, a little research into the history of Middletown/Wesleyan relations would show that, in context with other campus/community divides, the one between Middletown and Wesleyan is extraordinarily minor. The large majority of unrest on Wesleyan’s campus has historically been the product of students (like the 1990 firebombing of the president’s office). To be blunt, Holt dramatically misrepresents both Middletown and Wesleyan to leverage his political position. We may all be working class proles here in Middletown, but I think some of us possess education enough to identify intellectual dishonesty when we see it."
"WESU expands programming","2008-09-12","by Ben Firke, Contributing Writer","If a resident of central Connecticut turned their radio to 88.1 FM, they might wonder if the Nutmeg State had suddenly transformed into an oasis of pan-cultural music without their knowledge. On Friday alone, listeners from Hartford to New Haven can tune in to a showcase of aural eclecticism: From a show hosted by and featuring creative Middletown youth to live break-beat mixing to a pair of Latin music shows, WESU radio specializes in an diverse mix of programming driven equally by University students and Middletown residents. Recently, a combination of new shows and proposals, as well as some older local initiatives that not all University students are aware of, indicate that now is an exciting time for 88.1. “The Wesleyan Report,” dubbed an “Argus for the Airwaves,” by WESU President Noah Hutton ’09, will air on Fridays from 2-3 p.m. The show will feature campus news, CFA events, sports roundups, interviews with professors and taped re-broadcasts of select on-campus lectures.  “It’ll be like a once a week podcast,” Hutton said of the show, which was designed by WESU to place more focus on current University events. Besides broadening its programming through “The Wesleyan Report” and a variety of new indie-rock programs, WESU is attempting another expansion: boosting its signal from 1500 to 6000 watts. If the station upgrades, 88.1 FM will be able to broadcast to almost all of Connecticut, not just the central region of the state. This would give WESU access to most of Connecticut’s 3.5 million residents, making it the most powerful college radio station in the state, surpassing the UConn station by 1,600 watts. Hutton made clear that the station still needs to secure funding to pay for the transmitter, but the station’s recent move to the Department for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships may positively affect the outcome. Hutton also dismissed a rumor that President Michael Roth sought to “axe” the station last academic year, attributing the shift in departments to the standard “shuffling” that occurs when a new president begins work at a college. WESU’s funding remains unchanged, and a presentation to Roth and his executive team was well received. Hutton also stressed 88.1’s often-overlooked community outreach efforts and asserted that WESU is the most Middletown-integrated organization at the University. Of the more than 100 DJ’s affiliated with the station, half are residents of Middletown. Programs such as “Jive at 5” promote town events as well as arts calendars for the entire central Connecticut region.  However, WESU’s town-gown programs include more than radio programming—they extend to several live events on Main Street. The station sponsors a monthly dance party at local dance hall Jimmy’s Jump and Jive, hiring a DJ and opening the doors to both Middletown residents and Wesleyan students. The Button Retreat, another Main Street venue, is rented seasonally for student band performances and Middletown poetry readings. Additionally, WESU sponsors a tent at the annual classic car cruise. Currently, WESU is working on more outreach to the University, with programs like “The Wesleyan Report.”  “We’ve been a part of Middletown very firmly,” Hutton said. “And we’re actually trying now to become more a part of Wesleyan.”"
"Misreading Mytheology","2008-09-16","by Mytheos Holt,","Dear Mr. deBoer, Considering that you never felt compelled to write in the Argus before now, and I rarely feel compelled to respond to responses to my work, I think we’re both breaking rules here. But I do have to defend myself from your attacks that, I think, arise largely from a misreading of my argument. To begin with, I had never argued that Middletown is conservative. That would be patently absurd. I am aware, given that our representative is Rose DeLauro, that Middletown is a Democratic community. But as I think you saw in the recent primaries, Democratic voters are hardly homogenous, so that does not necessitate an attitude of beneficence toward Wesleyan students, who strike me as a distinctly different sort of liberal than the average Middletown resident.  Secondly, I never said Middletown was poor, only that it was “blue collar,” and contrary to what you may believe, I have reasons for believing that. The average yearly wage in Middletown is somewhere around $46,000. Considering that some “blue collar” jobs pay as much as $57,000, I think this is a perfectly reasonable interpretation of the term “blue collar,” which is distinct from “poor.” Moreover, just because Middletown has officially protected “artists” and “minorities,” that does not mean that the town itself has a generally pleasant attitude toward nonconformity in the present day, or that this attitude spills over onto Wesleyan students (a nonconforming lot if ever there was one!).  Thirdly, you say that police officers do not despise nonconformity, but merely have “uniformly low opinions of people who break the law.” I don’t dispute that this is true of most police officers, but I find it to be completely inconsistent with the actions on Fountain Avenue, which I think only can be explained by some sort of resentment. I do not think that resentment is income-based, but culturally-based. I know that police officers do not fit a Marxist model, and that they are not poor, uneducated proles. As for casting them as crude stereotypes, I think most of the campus sees them that way after Fountain Avenue, but I do not pretend for a second that it applies to ALL Middletown police officers, which is one reason why I warned my peers that authority should be respected at times.  You also say that my “town versus gown” argument is pure fantasy, and that the conflict between Wesleyan and Middletown is “relatively minor.” You are right that, compared with students at other schools, we have it fairly good. But whatever else you think, rest assured that I have done some research into Middletown/Wesleyan relations, and I know that as recently as the nineties, some college guides (especially the Wesleyan student-produced College Prowler guide) warned students about entering Middletown alone or at night, because of the deep dislike the residents harbored for students. With respect, this hostility is obviously not gone, at the point at which it is barely two weeks into the semester and we already have suffered at least one incident where Public Safety felt compelled to send out an alarm. Perhaps irritation is as far as it goes with you, but that does NOT mean that all Middletown residents share your comparatively benevolent view of us. In fact, the evidence from last semester and this one show that many of them do not. Finally, I must assure you that I was not being intentionally intellectually dishonest, but merely describing things as I see them. My piece had two theses, and you appear to have conflated them as one. Thesis one was that Middletown shows a varying degree of hostility toward Wesleyan students, that this hostility was based on a cultural divide between student and resident, and that it appears to have impacted the judgment of the officers on Fountain Avenue. Thesis two was that well-meaning, egalitarian minded Wesleyan students are ill-equipped to deal with the reality that the disparity between class cultures is more significant than the actual income disparity that exists between classes, which is why communal economic egalitarianism will only worsen conditions by trying to force mutual coexistence across this oil-and-water culture divide. I apologize for any offense, which was purely unintentional. I would hate to contribute to the antagonism that already exists, especially given that this is a time when both Middletown and Wesleyan clearly need to let our hackles down."
"2002 incident recalls Fountain","2008-09-16","by Jacob Kleinman, Staff Writer","On Sept. 8, 2002, Middletown police broke up an outdoor party on Pine Street using batons, pepperball guns, and a K-9 unit. Twelve students were arrested. “They called them the ’Pine Street Riots,’ ” said Matt Lerner ’03. “I remember it being a rowdy night.” With the release of the Fountain Report on Monday, the story of the 2002 “Pine Street Riots” is useful in examining the ups and downs of a campus trying to come to terms with a conflict that hits upon issues of class, social life, and the law. As alumni witnesses recalled the angry Wespeaks, forums, administrative responses, and the 2002 night itself, the question is begged: Why did this happen again? According to Nonie Hamilton ’03, the party started to go down hill when a fire alarm was set off. “I was at a house party turned into a street party, and the fire alarm went off,” she said. “Rather than slowly escalating, there was a huge fire department response. The [police] immediately showed up and started arresting kids, throwing them on the ground and in the back of cop cars.” Vice President of Student Affairs Mike Whaley, who was dean of students in 2002, explained the order of events. “The police were called by the fire department, [the fire department] was having trouble getting through the crowd,” Whaley said. “Like on Fountain [in 2008], the police had to forcibly clear the crowd.” Once the police arrived, the conflict only escalated, said Lerner, who was a Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) official. “I remember we came onto a scene,” Lerner said. “There were police cars. Everything turned into a lot of chaos. Everyone was running in different directions. People yelling. Confusion. People didn’t know what was happening at the time. I was pretty upset.” Similarly to the 2008 Fountain Avenue incident, students attempted to contact University officials as the conflict unfolded. In 2002, however, Hamilton said, efforts were not as successful. President Roth arrived at the scene during last semester’s incident. “I had a dean’s home phone number,” Hamilton said. “But I don’t think she completely believed us. They didn’t send anyone down.” As with last Spring, a forum was held the next day to discuss what had happened, though there were many more University and local officials in attendance. Along with members of the Middletown police and fire departments, several WSA members—Hamilton and Joey Wender ’03 among them—spoke. At the forum for the 2008 incident, WSA President Mike Pernick ’10 spoke, but the only adult official present was Whaley. Wender, president of the WSA for the 2002-2003 academic year, felt that the forum was beneficial. “Generally, it prompted some good, healthy dialogue,” he said. “Nothing like it happened again. It stayed in the background. Chalking became a big issue not much later and held the interest of the campus.” Not all students agreed with Wender, however. In a Wespeak published on Friday, Sept. 13, 2002, David Weiner ’06 expressed unhappiness with the result of the forum. “We blew our opportunity on Tuesday night to get real answers and opinions about what happened the night of Saturday the 7th,” Wiener wrote. “ [Deputy Police Chief Phillip] Pessina came to campus, determined to give vague, unhelpful answers. He stalled, he did not directly answer a single pertinent question, circumvented and forgot to answer pieces of questions, and used the pending trials as a judicial shield.” After police broke up the Fountain Avenue party this past May, students wondered whether the Middletown Police Department had a grudge against University students. Alumni who experienced the 2002 event had mixed views of whether animosity between police and students led to that event. “I never experienced [animosity] before that night,” Hamilton said. “It seemed like there were tensions that I hadn’t really understood.” Wender felt that minimal previous interaction between University students and Middletown police led to a serious miscommunication that ultimately caused the incident.  “I would call it a lack of respect,” Wender said. “[Police and students] rarely interacted with one another, and they rarely clashed. Students were used to PSafe. Police were used to Middletown residents.” Similarly, Whaley does not believe that pre-existing town-gown divisions incited the 2002 conflict. “Some students may think there is a sustained animosity, but I don’t think that’s the case,” he said. “When the police come to campus, they’re doing the job they have to do.” Only three weeks after the “Pine Street Riots,” attention quickly shifted elsewhere as President Doug Bennet enacted a moratorium on chalking. The New York Times reported on the event and, in November, the faculty voted against the chalking moratorium. A cursory glance through The Argus archives for the rest of that semester shows little, if any, interest in the Sept. 8th conflict.  However, on October 25, 2002, it was announced that, in response to the Sept. 8 incident, Officer David Beauchemin had been selected as the liaison between the Middletown Police Department and the University. While there had been a liaison in 2001, the officer had retired and had not been replaced. Meanwhile, Whaley, was charged with investigating potential Student Judiciary Board cases that surrounded the incident.  “What I was most concerned about was finding out what happened at the [2002] incident, making sure students weren’t in violation of the non-academic code of conduct,” he said.  This time around, as a member of the Fountain Avenue Working Group, Whaley is again listening to student perspectives of the conflict. Thanks to a binder full of student eyewitness reports and video footage from Public Safety, Whaley believes that the University has a more clear-cut version of what happened in May 2008 than it did in 2002. “We can make more specific recommendations about what should happen,” he said. Whaley believes that, ultimately, the similarities between the two incidents will become evident in the Fountain report. “When the final report comes out, some of the recommendations [will be] the same we recommended after [the 2002] incident,” he said."
"Courant columnist critiques students","2008-09-16","by Ezra Silk, Features Editor","After the incident last semester on Fountain Avenue, The Hartford Courant covered the event heavily, featuring a story on the front page. Rick Green, a local columnist and former Middletown resident, wrote an opinion piece that was critical of what he described as Wesleyan students’ misguided sense of activism. Having covered Middletown for The Courant in the late ’80s and early ’90’s, Green has examined the long history of the University’s town-gown relations. Argus: Was this story really front-page worthy? Rick Green: I think so. Because of the long history between the Middletown cops and Wesleyan students, and the difficulty with the neighborhood, I think it’s fair game, especially because of the reaction on all sides. The police were indignant and the students were indignant. I also think this got so much attention because of how quickly it got out of hand. A: How was covering Middletown back in the day? RG: I was in Middletown in the late ’80s and early ’90s, and there were these sorts of issues even before the firebombing thing. A: Why did you decide to enter the fray? RG: The reason I wrote about this is because of the way students got indignant about it because they felt that their civil rights got violated because they wanted to party at one in the morning. It’s not some valiant cause or something—we’re not talking about education or the poor or Iraq. It’s the right to get wasted and play music on the street. If you’ve been drinking and the cops show up and tell you to get off the street, that’s what you do. The cops come, you book—that was always my rule. A: Do you think Wesleyan has ever been an “activist” school? RG: You could argue Wesleyan has a good tradition of protest—but that’s why I saw this as a cheapening of that. A: What did you think about the crazy anonymous comment wars that this event incited? RG: That’s how I first got dragged into it. I saw the comments on The Hartford Courant website and on Wesleying, who did a good job covering this one. I assume the comments attracted Wesleyan alumni from across the country. All the comments about police brutality—I found it amusing that people were reacting like it was civil rights in 1964. A: Did you think the cops’ behavior was justified? RG: That would raise a lot of questions on my mind. I can’t defend what they did."
"After year-long absence, WesDEF program returns","2008-09-19","by Miriam Leshin, Editor-in-Chief","“What does your name mean to you?” Micah Weiss ’10 asked a group of 15 first-year and transfer students gathered in the Nicolson Lounge last Sunday night. After receiving these instructions for the icebreaker, the students split off into pairs to discuss the origins of their names, as well as their likes and dislikes of them. Weiss and Marcus Warmington ’09 are the WesDEFs—Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitators—for Nicolson 5 and 5.5, as well as Clark 1 and Clark 2.  Every month, Warmington and Weiss, as well as 17 other WesDEFs, will lead discussions focused around power, identity and oppression in first-year and transfer halls across campus. Each pair (and one group of three) is assigned four halls to work with and meets with the same group every month. According to its mission statement, the WesDEF program conducts workshops, in which students facilitate conversations about race, gender, sexual orientation, class and other identities and their effect on community. “[WesDEF seeks] not to provide answers but to incite questions and to provide participants with the knowledge and tools for further personal explorations and social awareness,” the mission statement continues. “Workshops will also help to create a space that emphasizes safety to engage in productive in-depth dialogue to promote understanding about how oppression works at Wesleyan and in society.” Founded in 2005 by Iris Jacob ’06, WesDEF first ran through the academic year of 2005-2006 as a program affiliated with Residential Life, which gave monetary compensation to the facilitators. “It was a really innovative and creative program and something that was absolutely necessary for the Wesleyan community,” said Molly Birnbaum ’09, who was part of this original team and is part of the new one—in which none of the facilitators receive pay—as well. When Jacobs graduated in 2006, the program ran under a WesDEF intern in the Office of Diversity and Academic Achievement (ODAA). According to Birnbaum, however, administrative differences caused the program to fall apart in the fall of 2006. The ODAA then sent out applications for WesDEFs in the spring of 2007.  Birnbaum noted that since the applications were due during reading week, only five students applied—all five, including the former WesDEF intern, were hired. The new WesDEFs spent the fall of 2007 working with Dean for Diversity and Student Engagement Danny Teraguchi and the ODAA to try to revamp the program. However, because there were only five of them, Teraguchi designed a different program model specifically for a group of their size and also presented the students with the option to create their own program. When the new facilitators still didn’t have a plan of action at the end of the fall semester, they decided to split from the ODAA and start their own group. “We had Danny’s support and he told us he hoped we’d apply for a grant from the ODAA [even after the split], which we did end up getting in the spring,” said Sarice Greenstein ’10, one of the five ODAA WesDEFs and the only one who is still a WesDEF now. “He always presented us with the option that we could be a student group and then we wouldn’t have to report to him or work within his budget.” Additionally, the ODAA budget didn’t allow for any more WesDEF’s to be hired, and at that point the program had shrunk to four. “The only people who applied were white women and it’s important for WesDEF to have different groups of people,” Greenstein said. “We needed more support. This wasn’t WesDEF. We needed more people. We were all inexperienced with WesDEF—it just didn’t make any sense.” After registering as a student group with the Community Outreach Committee (COCo), Greenstein and the other three WesDEFs spent the spring of 2008 trying to recruit new members so that the program could at last be revived this fall—no workshops had occurred over the 2007-2008 year. “We had a training in the spring, but afterwards we still didn’t feel adequately prepared to go do workshops in the dorms,” said Sara Quinn ’11, who joined WesDEF that spring.  “We also thought that the process of recruitment was not finished.” Birnbaum explained the difficulties of recruiting from all communities within the student body. “Outreach can’t just be in e-mail, it needs to be an effort,” Birnbaum said. “It was a very organic process. It was a coordinated process to reach out to all different types of people.” Students continued to join the program at the end of the semester and throughout the summer, until there were 19 WesDEF’s, six of whom now make up a Coordinating Committee, which meets weekly to set the group’s agenda. The problem remained, however, that Birnbaum was the only WesDEF who had been part of the organization in its earlier form—and therefore the only one who had had facilitation training. Over the summer, Birnbaum attended a three-day anti-racism workshop and a one-day anti-oppression workshop so that she could be a resource for the new WesDEF’s.  There, she met Rosaida Morales Rosario ’72 and Deanne Shapiro—of Rosario/Shapiro Consulting Group, which specializes in diversity training—who agreed to come to the University during orientation and train the WesDEFs. Two days after the freshmen arrived at the University, the WesDEFs met to begin their three-day intensive training, which ran from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Thursday, Friday and Saturday.  While Rosario and Shapiro ran roughly half of the training—and at no charge—former Visiting Professor of Sociology Eyal Rabinovitch led a session on group facilitation and conflict mediation, and Birnbaum supplemented the rest with her knowledge from the summer. Bon Appétit even agreed to provide food for the group while they were staying on campus. “The training was really intensive, because of the hours, the difficulty of the subject matter, and the difficulty of making a functioning group,” Quinn said. “But it was also a really exciting experience to see the group come together, to get to know each other, and to realize that the program was actually going to happen.” Bulaong Ramirez ’11 described one particularly powerful training activity in which facilitators split up into those who identify as white and those who identify as students of color, and had each group answer four questions: What we want you to know but would never say? What we never want to see from you? What we never want you to see from us?  What we never want to hear, see or experience again? Each group had to discuss amongst themselves, and then appoint two representatives to stand in the middle of the circle and read their groups’ responses, while the remainder of the facilitators remained quiet. “It was something I had never thought to do before,” Ramirez said. “I think it was a really healthy activity, and it was really empowering, I think, for both sides.” Quinn, who was one of her group’s representatives in the center of the circle, agreed. “For me, it was the most important moment of the training,” she said. “Because it was a moment when I had to answer to myself and I had to answer to the group.” After the training, the WesDEFs began their facilitations with their assigned halls. “Going into your first facilitation and meeting your hall for the first time, even if you go in with a plan, you’re still going to have to adjust to the dynamic of the halls,” Ramirez said. “All you can do is pay attention to the mood of the group during the facilitation, because some students have heard about issues of oppression millions of times but others have not technically been exposed to it on a greater level.” Quinn explained that the slightly improvisatory aspect of the facilitation fits in line with the program’s mission. “It’s intended to be generated by the students who participate,” she said. “They will generate the content of the program in their conversations, through their questions, their experiences and their response to WesDEF. We’re there to listen to them and to help them listen to each other, while acting as a resource for their conversations.” Birnbaum stressed this collaborative element of the program as well. “We’re not trying to preach nor do we claim to be experts or have the answers,” she said. “Right now we hope to establish ourselves on campus as an integral group in the Wesleyan community and prove ourselves and the importance of the program, as well as try to find a place within the institutional structure.” Warmington noted that, like Ramirez and Quinn, his first facilitations have varied, as the small size of the group in the Nicolsons may have inhibited some members from feeling comfortable participating, which differed from his experience facilitating in Clark. “Overall, in my personal experience, a smaller group is often harder than a larger one,” he said. “With a larger one, more people are willing to raise their hand and participate more, so then more people participate. It’s a domino effect. I think people just felt safer in a larger group.” The Nicolson presentation, however, was still well received.  “Even if the Wesleyan things are a little corny and politically correct, I think the presenters are doing a really good job and they are really honest with themselves,” said Bryce Fintel ’12, who attended the session. “They were really cool.” Rachel Goodman ’12, however, took some issue with the program’s mission. “I feel like in this meeting and on campus in general, we are obsessed with defining our identities,” she said. “From gender pronouns to religion to politics, everyone always wants to know who you are. But I think it’s more important to just be comfortable with who you are without having to announce it or confine yourself to language and words and categories.” Despite varied student feedback, Weiss is happy to see the program back in action. “WesDEF was really important to me as a freshman,” he said. “And I’m really excited that it’s been revitalized for this year. It helps create a great community and a space for these dialogues.”"
"Budgetary constraints threaten NY Times readership program","2008-09-19","by Katherine Yagle, Contributing Writer","Due to the recent increase in the price of the New York Time—rom 30 to 45 cents per university cop—unding for the Wesleyan Readership Program is slated to run out early next semester. The program, which was started nearly nine years ago, distributes free copies of the paper across campus Monday through Friday.  The New York Times Readership Program offers a discounted subscription to educational institutions that wish to provide copies of the paper to students. For the past few years, the Organization and External Affairs Committee (OEAC) of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) has brought 700 copies of the Times to campus five days a week at the price of 30 cents each. Annually, such distribution cost a total of $25,000, with $15,000 being paid by the WSA, $6,000 by the Office of Academic Affairs, and $4,000 by the Office of Student Affairs.  “This is a partnership between the WSA and the administration,” said WSA Vice President Saul Carlin ’09. “It benefits the entire community.” Last year, David Booth, manager of the New York Times Readership Program, alerted former WSA Vice President Emily Malkin ’08 that the price would increase to 45 cents per copy—a 50 percent increase—over two semesters. As a result, the annual cost of the program increased to $41,650.  Last semester, when the transition price of 40 cents per copy went into effect, the OEAC reduced the number of copies delivered daily to 600 in order to meet the annual $25,000 budget.  “Almost half the papers that are picked up are picked up in Exley,” Carlin said. “A lot of professors are picking these up, and a lot of professors like the idea of their students reading the New York Times every day.”  With that in mind, Malkin began reaching out to various academic departments in order to seek funding to continue the program. However, when the WSA approached the departments, the Office of Academic Affairs decided that their contribution to the program would function as an umbrella contribution from all academic departments, thus eliminating any extra funding the WSA had hoped to receive. In order to continue the program, the OEAC proposed a proportional contribution increase: the WSA, the Office of Student Affairs, and the Office of Academic Affairs would each increase their funding by 43 percent. Additionally, the students approached the Office of Admission for funding assistance. OEAC’s proposal suggested that the WSA contribute $21,500, the Office of Student Affairs contribute $5,700, the Office of Academic Affairs contribute $8,600, and the Office of Admission contribute $6,000.  Dean of Students Rick Culliton vetoed the proposed funding increase.  “We are in the midst of a five-year review of our budgets, trying to make reductions across the University,” said Culliton. “In looking at our own budgets and needing to make reductions, [the New York Times Readership Program] is a very nice thing to have on campus, but in our view it’s not something that is essential.” Dean of Admission Nancy Meislahn was unable to accept the WSA’s proposal, due to the present policy that the Office of Admission only provide funding to activities that are directly related the office, not to student activities.  “I believe that the New York Times Readership Program is a fantastic admissions tool,” Carlin said. “ I remember when I was visiting as a pre-frosh, I was on a balcony looking down on people eating and I saw half the tables with New York Times papers spread open and students reading and discussing what was going on. The WSA believes that the program is directly related to Admissions. We have prospective students coming here and seeing what I saw. The whole community benefits from this civic engagement that happens when people can pick up a copy of the New York Times, sit around a table in Usdan or in Pi, read what’s going on, and talk about it.” The OEAC currently faces a rapidly depleting fund, even with the decreased number of papers being delivered.  “It’s not that Admission didn’t want to [fund the program], it’s not that Dean Rick didn’t want to do it, it’s that the administration doesn’t want to do it. It’s that wherever we go, there seems to be an assumption that the WSA can foot the bill all on our own, and we can’t,” Carlin said.  The students are continuing to make their case to the administration and seek a proportional increase in funding.  However, unless an agreement is reached, the fund will run out sometime in early spring—effectively ending the Readership Program.  “It’s not that anyone in Student Affairs doesn’t think the program is a nice thing to have on campus,” said Culliton. “It’s just that at this point, as we look at tight budgets, it’s harder to justify that.” Carlin hopes that a sense of urgency as the deadline nears will encourage members of the Wesleyan administration to agree to funding increases.  “Holding a paper in your hands is a completely different experience than reading the news online,” he said. “To lose that experience on this campus would be a real tragedy.”"
"WesVotes promotes student registration","2008-09-19","by Meredith Rogerson, Contributing Writer","A team of students and administrators finalized plans last week to institute WesVotes, a partnership between the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) and various administrative offices aimed at aiding students in the registration and voting processes. The program, currently led by a bipartisan group of University students, represents a major step towards increasing voter turnout within the campus community. The program’s mission is two-fold: one, to raise awareness among the student body about civic engagement; and two, to facilitate both the registration and voting processes for University students. Both the Office of Residential Life (ResLife) and the Office of the University Registrar have worked closely with students to make the program a reality.  The program itself was a direct reaction to poor turnout of college-age voters in past elections, said Chris Goy ’09, former president of the Wesleyan Democrats and the main organizer of WesVotes.   “There are may people who become disenfranchised by being in college,” said Goy, who attributes this to students’ busy schedules and the fact that many of them are from out-of-state.  Goy also notes that voters between the ages of 18 and 24 make up a substantial segment of the country’s population.  “The fact that [this portion] of the population is underrepresented is shameful,” said Goy. Thanks to the Registrar’s Office, students can now find a link to DeclareYourself.org at the top of their Electronic Portfolios, where they can register to vote, request absentee ballots, and view information about voting and the election process. With the help of ResLife, students can also register to vote or obtain an absentee ballot through a WesVotes representative who lives in their residence hall. This makes the program especially helpful for students who do not wish to vote in the state of Connecticut.   “We have asked each RA to identify a Hall Captain,” said Director of Residential Life Fran Koerting in an email. “Hall Captains will discuss voter registration with their neighbors and assist each person individually to register to vote or request an absentee ballot.”  For students who will be voting in Middletown on Nov. 4, the WesVotes team has coordinated with the Office of Community Service to make both registration and voting as simple as possible.  “Students can drop off their registration cards at a designated drop box at WesStation, where we will collect them and deliver them to City Hall,” said Director of Community Service and Volunteerism Cathy Crimmins Lechowicz. “The [Center for Community Partnerships] will also provide transportation on the day of the election to transport students to their designated polling station.” She added that vans would be leaving roughly every half-hour from the Usdan University Center on Election Day. WesVotes has no plans to stop its services once the upcoming election has passed.  “The purpose is to create a system of institutionalized voter registration,” said Goy, who shares this vision of the program’s endurance with Director of Student Activities and Leadership Development Tim Shiner. Shiner, whose office has been active in the establishment of the WesVotes program, believes that it is an important addition to the Wesleyan community.  “My hope is that having a central group of students which brings together the various stakeholders will…assist in sparking greater civic engagement in the student body and the larger community,” he said. “I hope to work with the students involved from year to year to provide continuity in their efforts.” Many students agree that WesVotes is a welcome addition to the University, especially since the program caters to the student who has a full schedule and would therefore be less inclined to vote. “Almost everyone knows what’s going on in the election,” said Sam Hecht ’12. “But for most people there’s just no motivation. It would really help a lot if students could vote from their dorm rooms.”  “Wesleyan students don’t need a hand-out,” said Goy, “but they do deserve the right information.”"
"Mytheology: The Wages of Immaturity","2008-09-30","by Mytheos Holt, Columnist","“All grandeur, all power, all subordination rest on the executioner. He is the horror and bond of human association; remove this incomprehensible agent from the world, and at that very instant order gives way to chaos, thrones topple and society disappears.” -Comte Joseph de Maistre It is an oft-remarked fact that Wesleyan students dislike external control. Indeed, if one looked back through the issues of this noble paper, one would probably find that the majority of angry Wespeaks are written in response to some abuse of authority, either real or imagined, whether it is perpetrated by the Wesleyan administration, the faculty, the Bon Appetit staff, Public Safety, the Middletown Police or even the laws of economics. A visitor who used these articles as an indicator of the prevailing weltanschauung at Wesleyan would probably come to the conclusion that if this campus believes in anything, it believes in questioning authority. That is, unless you question the implicit moral authority of those who question, in which case you’re a reactionary who has to be silenced. But let’s not mince words. It is no surprise, therefore, that even when Wesleyan students exercise authority against other Wesleyan students, it is defied. There is no clearer example of this tendency than the article in Friday’s Argus (“Insult to injury: Failure to Comply stats rise,” Sept. 26, 2008, Volume CXLIV, Number 8), which discussed the overwhelming tide of Failure to Comply violations on this campus. Most students have never met a form of authority they couldn’t blow off with relative impunity, and it is understandably galling to them that the Student Judicial Board (SJB) refuses to be so flippantly treated. It is quite admirable that the SJB is standing firm on this matter, not only because it may finally expunge the prevailing prepubescent attitude that all authority is meaningless, but also because this exercise of unassailable power may actually provoke a discussion about the responsibilities associated with said power. Spiderman’s axiom about the relation between these two concepts desperately needs yet one more historical illustration. Now, there’s no disputing that the SJB has a tough time convincing students of its capacity to be efficacious. It is widely perceived as the guardian of such unenforceable measures as the chalking ban and the underage drinking ban. Being charged with enforcing such measures is utter poison for any judicial authority that wants to be perceived as such, and the SJB is not perceived as such, largely due to the aforementioned immature attitude among students that all authority is useless. However, far from being the libratory ethos which most of Wesleyan’s armchair anarchists believe it to be, this attitude actually provides cover for a few powers which the SJB does possess and which, if the students actually took the time to pay attention, might alarm them terribly. The most prominent example of this sort of power is the SJB’s charge to enforce Wesleyan’s Speech Code. The Orwellian name of this document is not accidental—it is nothing less than a document regulating what students can and cannot say without serious consequences, and if you actually take the time to read the document, you find that we can say very little indeed. For instance, the passage detailing what “Discriminatory Harassment” is defines its subject as follows: “Discriminatory harassment may include any action or statement intended to insult, stigmatize, or degrade an individual or group on the basis of […] race, color, religion, sexual orientation, gender, age, disability, national or ethnic origin, veteran status, or any other basis protected by local, state or federal law in any activity administered by the University.” Now, depending on who sits on the SJB, these words could mean practically anything and we’d have no concrete legal way of constraining them from deciding that one remark is hate speech one year and then is not hate speech the following year. In fact, it’s precisely because of passages like this that the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) gave Wesleyan a speech code rating of Red, the worst rating possible, according to its website www.thefire.org. Mind you, nobody ever bothers to contest this sort of abusive and vague language because nobody believes the SJB has any power, and so they never pay attention to it.  More fundamentally, the attitude toward authority at Wesleyan misunderstands a fundamental element in the dialectic between authority and liberty—implicit in any persuasive criticism of authority is the idea that, were it not for a particular flawed abuse, the criticizer would obey the authority. Otherwise, the authority will believe there’s no pleasing the criticizer, and will be happy to bash his skull against the pavement. This is not a positive outcome for an authority figure, or that authority figure’s subjects. Civic engagement is much more productive; but civic engagement requires the pesky notion that there is an authoritative civic entity with which to engage.  Most Wesleyan students aren’t willing to accept this notion, naturally, which is why the SJB ought to keep enforcing those Failure to Comply violations, ruthlessly if necessary. They should do anything necessary to make this campus realize the necessity of loosening the grip of the administration’s iron fist through legitimate, respectful means. Of course, that may be impossible, as most students seem to prefer idly thumb-wrestling with it."
"Red & Black owner connects student bands with Public Bar","2008-10-03","by Liz Tung, Arts Editor","Rob DeRosa — who most of you probably know better as the manager of the Red & Black Café — has been a fixture in the Connecticut music scene for years. When he’s not chatting up student musicians, or roasting whole pork shoulders in the R&B kitchen, the Meriden native is busy digging up local bands to book at nearby venues or feature on his “Connecticut connected” WESU show “Homegrown.”  DeRosa even has his own label, Thin Man Music, which has released the music of over 50 Connecticut bands in its seven years of existence.  Despite his years of experience with the local scene, when I asked DeRosa about the process for booking shows at the University, he was vague.  “I’m not sure,” he said. “I’ve never booked a show at Wesleyan.” While this particular lack of town-gown crossover may have perfectly innocent origins (after all, who would want to deal with University bureaucracy when you could just call up a local bar?), it speaks to the discrete, inward looking nature of Wesleyan’s music scene. As DeRosa points out, when student bands play shows, they’re usually relatively informal affairs carried out at on-campus venues, which are almost all student housing, from Eclectic to WestCo to senior houses.  “The campus music scene is insular,” DeRosa said. “If you’re not a student, you are completely excluded. Can a townie go to the dorms? Not likely.”  Wesleyan’s island mentality results in an artistic culture that is not only exclusive, but which, DeRosa says, runs the risk of stunting students’ artistic growth.  “When you play at the dorms, you’re playing in front of your friends,” he explained. “But you can’t just always play in front of the converted. Sometimes you have to convert some of those people yourself. Playing off campus is an important part of a band’s development. You can find out if you’re actually any good, or if your friends are just blowing smoke up your ass.”  It was, in part, out of these concerns that DeRosa’s most recent musical brainchild was born. It all started with the recent opening of Public Bar & Grill, the latest addition to Middletown’s Main Street pub scene. With its respectable stage and ample floor space, the polished, slightly Starbucks-ian Public is an ideal venue for live music. DeRosa originally contacted the owner to book some of his own bands, but after being told that Public only hosted cover bands on the weekends (all Thin Man’s acts are originals), he decided to take a different tack.  “I told him, you know, Wednesday nights are a big bar night for Wesleyan kids, and you need a way to grab a piece of that action,” DeRosa says. “I saw it as an opportunity to bring some music down to Main Street” And so Wesleyan Wednesdays were born: a once-a-week music series at Public featuring Wesleyan bands.  “I tried to get them to call it Wes Wednesdays, but the guy didn’t quite get it,” DeRosa added.  The first WesWed will take place on Oct. 8, with Bottle Up & Go, a whiskey blues duo featuring Keenan Mitchell ’09 on slide guitar and vocals and Fareed Sajan ’09 on drums. The two will be accompanied this coming Wednesday by Lucas Carrico ’09 on saxophone. The band, which Sajan estimates has been around since the 2005-2006 school year, has established itself over the last few years with a number of gigs at Wesleyan, Yale and various venues in Connecticut and New York. The band will also be opening for Man Man at the Heirloom Arts Theatre on Oct. 12. According to Sajan, BU&G’s involvement with Wesleyan Wednesdays grew organically from the University’s informal live music network.  “My friend introduced me to Robbie, and Robbie told me about [the Wesleyan Wednesday series],” Sajan said. “We respected him immediately because he had a piercing. I kind of told Robbie about BU&G, but he said he had heard stuff about us and wanted us to play the first performance at Public.” Given DeRosa’s hope that WesWed will help bridge the gap between the Middletown and Wesleyan music scenes, BU&G seems like an appropriate choice for the series’ debut; not only will they bring a University presence into Middletown venue, but the band’s off-campus experience may help to ease the path for future Wesleyan acts. DeRosa has also secured unofficial promises from Wesleyan alum bands like Bear Hands and Boy Crisis to play future WesWed dates.  DeRosa has several bands lined up for the next few Wednesdays (the Shade will play on Oct. 18, while a Wesleyan jazz group and Blink-182 cover band will perform the following weeks), but he hopes that more University bands will step forward. Performers will get a cut of the night’s profits and pre-show exposure on “Homegrown.” Interested musicians can contact DeRosa at thinmanmusic@sbcglobal.net, or chat him up while grabbing a Red & Black sandwich. As for next Wednesday, DeRosa predicts that there will be a small cover, which will be offset by drink specials. For his part, Sajan promises a solid show, though he has a warning for anyone tempted to drunkenly shout “Freebird.”  “We will be forced to castrate them,” Sajan says. “We have gardening shears always. It is a part of our ’image.’”"
"Panel discusses global financial crisis","2008-10-10","by Matthew Ruggiero, Contributing Writer","The concern felt by many over the present financial crisis was clear on Monday afternoon when around 100 University students, faculty and community members gathered for a program entitled “The Financial Crisis and its Political Ramifications,” held by the Center for the Study of Public Life and the departments of economics and government.  “Our idea was to provide an opportunity for students to hear faculty who have expertise in the area address these issues and to ask questions about them,” said Dean of the Social Sciences and Interdisciplinary Programs and Professor of Government J. Donald Moon. Moon, who helped organize the event, was optimistic about the number of attendees. “I was surprised—and pleased—by the number of people who came out,” he said. “Obviously, everyone is very concerned about the growing financial crisis; it’s a testament to the seriousness of our student body that so many took the time to learn more about it.” Erik Underwood ’09, one of the student attendees, explained his own motivation for attending.  “If we look at the headlines for the past couple of weeks, you see these headlines of ’apocalyptic crises,’” Underwood said. “I wanted to see their interpretations, from economic and political science standpoints.” Andrea DePetris ’10 agreed with Underwood, citing her wish to become more engaged with national concerns. “I was interested in attending the program because I’m not as informed about the financial crisis as I would like to be,” DePetris said. “As a college student living off of a pre-paid meal plan, it’s been too convenient for me to become absorbed in daily routines. This level of disengagement shouldn’t go unchecked.” The panel, which was facilitated by Moon, featured Assistant Professor of Economics and East Asian Studies Masami Imai, Chairman and Professor of Economics Richard Grossman, Professor of Government and Henry Merritt Wriston Chair in Public Policy Marc A. Eisner, Assistant Professor of Government Elvin Lim and University Vice President and Chief Investment Officer Thomas Kannam. Each panelist spoke on a topic within their discipline, with an audience discussion following. Imai began by addressing the causes and solutions of the financial crisis. Speaking in front of a PowerPoint slide labeled “What Happened?” Imai detailed the conditions and actions that led to the current crisis in the economy and analyzed the steps of responding to the problem. “We have to recapitalize the bank system in a way that does not create a severe moral hazard problem in the future,” Imai said. “We have to do it, and we have to do it quickly.” Grossman then traced some of the financial cycles in the United States and Great Britain in an effort to put today’s issues into a historical context. “Nothing going on is completely new,” Grossman said. “All this has happened before, and I would say will happen again. This has been the pattern for financial crises for the past two hundred years.” Eisner and Lim focused on the more political aspects of the present crisis. “There has been a mischaracterization of the problem by the right and left,” Lim said.  “The problem is not just Wall Street and the problem is not just government.” Kannam brought the issue home by discussing the management of the University’s investments. The importance of this topic was underscored by the recent report of the University’s endowment decline in the 2008 fiscal year.  “We [the University] are trying to take advantage of the cycles,” Kannam said. “Now we’re seeing more opportunities that we’ll benefit from in the long run.” Lim concluded by explaining that the crisis was also a result of the influence of American culture on people’s decisions and actions.  “The one thing market economies have not learnt to deal with are speculative bubbles,” Lim said. “Because we celebrate the entrepreneurial spirit, we embrace greed and speculation. They are two sides of the same coin. We can no more restrain speculation than we should restrain the entrepreneurial spirit and there is no easy exit from this dilemma.” For Lim, there was one central problem that must be fixed in order for regulation — and the capitalist system—to work. “At the heart of it all, we need to be clear,” Lim said. “We need laws that require full disclosure. The key is to find some way to break the chain of alliances and to have multiple and unconnected channels of oversight—and the premise of oversight is transparency.” Afterward, Underwood reflected on the prospects available for students graduating into an uncertain economic climate. “I’m either pessimistically optimistic or optimistically pessimistic,” Underwood said. “I can’t decide.”  Underwood went on to note that with issues such as global warming and energy, great change would be ongoing. “People will have to change the way they live their daily lives,” Underwood said. “Maybe not being able to get a job right after college—that sucks—but it’s a small drop in a much larger problem.”"
"Policy out of controversy","2008-11-14","by ,","This past Wednesday, the Fountain Avenue Commission e-mailed every student on campus a long list of proposed reforms to the University’s security policy. These reforms, which come in the wake of the Fountain incident, detail a myriad of ways to make our campus safer. Issues addressed include town-gown relations, the role of Public Safety and Middletown Police on campus and the use and regulation of handheld cameras. \tWe applaud the Wesleyan Student Assembly for their proposal—and not just because they spent a considerable amount of time on the issue. Were the University to enact their specific, insightful reforms, our campus could very well become a much more congenial place. The Commission has done exactly what is necessary to prevent another Fountain from occurring. \t Most of their ideas address “strained relations” on campus. They propose that Public Safety officers train students to work as escorts, as well as allow students to “shadow” an officer for a day. In addition, they suggest that individual officers be assigned to a given dorm—which, in conjunction with monthly programs, could forge strong bonds between students and their officers. They also apply this mindset to the MPD, who they say could talk with students at regular “Midnight Breakfasts” in Usdan. For students living in woodframe houses, they hope to draw up a map of campus that includes area residents, making it clear what is University property and what is not. All of their recommendations will help build trust on campus—which, considering how little seems to exist between students and police officers, could make the difference between a peaceful dispersal and a skirmish. \tAs for handheld cameras, the Commission is taking steps to protect students and their privacy. They contend that officers can use them to “survey” an area, but cannot use them to track an individual. Additionally, the Student Judicial Board cannot use footage as evidence against a student. The idea is to limit surveillance to the absolutely necessary—a restriction that could go a long way towards protecting students’ rights. \tThe Commission has done a commendable job. By compiling a list of well-thought-out proposals, they have given the University a blueprint for positive change. We hope the administration will work to enact their reforms."
"Bursting the Campus Bubble","2009-01-30","by Yael Chanoff and Nick Davenport,","Wesleyan’s campus isn’t gated (thankfully).  However, judging from the number of Middletown residents who can be seen on campus, you’d never guess that Wesleyan was not a walled fortress. Wesleyan acts like its own separate community, even though we are a part of Middletown. While we learn about racial and class inequalities in our classrooms, we replicate them daily. There is no official, clear University policy about non-University affiliated people using Wesleyan facilities, yet authorities and students act under the assumption that Middletown residents have no place in the Wesleyan community. For example, Middletown residents are frequently kicked out of computer labs, despite our surplus of computers. The University’s official policy on computer lab use by non-University affiliated people is vague and unclear; however, the policy that is actually enforced is very clear: Middletown residents are not allowed in Wesleyan computer labs. Are we happy with the current state of alienation between Middletown residents and Wesleyan students? Allowing people from Middletown to use our abundant resources could be mutually beneficial. It could be great if growing up near Wesleyan was a positive experience for Middletown’s youth, and if Wesleyan students took advantage of living in a diverse and vibrant urban community.  Agree? Disagree? Have better ideas than we do? Come to SDS’s Town-Gown Relations Forum in PAC 004, Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 4:30 p.m.!"
"Students Push for Prison Classes","2009-01-30","by Jae Aron, Features Editor","In his opening address at the College in Prison Symposium held last Monday, Assistant Professor of Political Studies at Bard College, Daniel Karpowitz, described a course he teaches on Dostoevsky’s “Crime and Punishment” in which students study the relationship between law and literature. The catch? His classroom and his students are behind bars. “The students are never called upon to reflect on themselves, but are called upon to do exactly the same thing as students at Bard College,” Karpowitz said. “The core principle of the program is to maintain the same academic rigor, scope, ambitions and spirit of what we do on the conventional campus.” Karpowitz, who is the Director of Policy and Academics for the Bard Prison Initiative, and Max Kenner, its founder, have been directing two satellite colleges inside two long-term maximum-security prisons and two transitional medium-security prisons for the past 11 years. Approximately 160 students are currently enrolled in the competitive program, which culminates in a Bard degree. 25 years ago, only 200,000 Americans were incarcerated; today, that number has risen to over 2 million. In fact, one out of every 100 Americans is now in prison. In the state of Connecticut, public investment in the prison system is greater than its investment in education. These types of statistics have motivated students like Russell Perkins ’09, who for the past two years has been a part of the Prisoner Solidarity Project, a group of students who hope to bring a College in Prison program to Wesleyan modeled after Bard, Boston University and others. “There is a conventional sense in which prisoners are the last people qualified to go to Wesleyan, but in that they largely represent a population that the educational system has profoundly failed, they are precisely the kind of students a place like Wesleyan should try to serve,” Perkins said. “Part of why I’m doing this is that I feel very strongly about Wesleyan as an institution. By incorporating this program, what we’re doing is actually committing to our belief that an education is a truly powerful thing.” The Prisoner Solidarity Project is an offshoot of WesPREP, the Wesleyan Prison Research and Education Program, a prison advocacy group that leads workshops in prison and promotes activism on campus. Students and faculty involved in the project are proposing a two-year College-in-Prison pilot program at Cheshire Correctional Institution in Connecticut, located about half an hour away from campus. Molly Birnbaum ’09 joined WesPREP her freshman year and has been deeply committed to the Prisoner Solidarity Project since then, working with faculty and staff to develop the program. She is also helping to write a grant for funding and organizing the symposium with other students. “Coming from my neighborhood, prison and policing were all around me, but it was the type of thing that was just a given in the makeup of urban life,” Birnbaum said. “I wanted to address those issues of systemic racism and class oppression that plagued the place where I grew up.” According to Perkins, the Wesleyan Center for Prison Education proposal pilot program would be highly competitive, with only 15 inmates being admitted, and taught exclusively by faculty. Admitted students would enroll in two courses per semester for “non degree seeking” academic credit, at least initially. “Academic credit is something Wesleyan takes very seriously, and it comes along with extremely rigorous expectations,” Perkins said. “We’re asking Wesleyan to make a significant investment in the sense that Wesleyan academic credit and faculty are two of our most precious resources.” The Center is also proposing “Critical Pedagogy,” a service-learning seminar where conventional Wesleyan students will learn about incarceration as well as tutor prisoners not accepted into the credit-bearing program. Jason Kavett ’09 started volunteering in prison his first year at Wesleyan. Since then Kavett and about 30 other students have led workshops at Cheshire and also at York Women’s Prison on subjects like anthropology, poetry and non-fiction writing. “Those [professors] who participate will find not just excited and talented students, but also a fresh outlet to share what they do best,” he said. “I think this will happen because, while being innovative, it is really only a reflection of the kind of engagement that defines Wesleyan as an institution. The program is actually quite conventional for us.” Birnbaum said the level of commitment of incarcerated students often surpasses that of the average Wesleyan student. “I’ve heard stories about professors who become reinvigorated as teachers through their experience working with incarcerated students,” she said. “Professors would not be diverting attention away from the Wesleyan classroom, but rather enriching their tenure with different experiences and new ways of approaching the process of learning.” Karpowitz and Kenner were joined by two other panelists on Monday night in the Memorial Chapel: Dr. Robert Cadigan, who directs a Prison Education Program at Boston University, and Theater Professor Ronald Jenkins, whose course “Activism and Outreach through Theater” allows Wesleyan students to perform alongside prisoners in the Connecticut Juvenile Training School and York Women’s Prison. While all five panelists advocated the program’s implementation at Wesleyan, there were differences of opinion as to how to carry out the program, even amongst colleagues. Questions about the value—or lack thereof—of interactions between traditional students and students in prison, as well as concerns about censorship and rules were common, as well as what one panelist called “anti-training”: that is, whether or not to allow faculty to discuss their students’ own “crime and punishment.” “The panel gave the community a chance to see a large spectrum of approaches and even politics that advocates for this program have,” Kavett said. “We saw that even though you could say there is an obvious kind of progressive politics in the background, there is no dogmatic set of beliefs one has to have to understand why the program is so compelling.”"
"Dialogue on Prisoner Project","2009-02-03","by Sylvia Ryerson,  on behalf of the Prisoner Solidarity Project","The Prisoner Solidarity Project appreciates the coverage of our group and the symposium we organized about College in Prison at Wesleyan. While we commend the Argus’ interest in and support of our proposal, we would like to make some clarifications.   The Prisoner Solidarity Project (PSP) is a campus group that has been running student-led, not-for-credit workshops in York and Cheshire prisons in Connecticut. We organized the January 26 symposium to disseminate information about our proposal for the Wesleyan Center for Prison Education. Please read our proposal, which appears in this issue of the Argus (See proposal XXXXX) For the Center to succeed it will require the ongoing support and engagement of the Wesleyan community. We would like to open a public dialogue regarding our proposal for a Wesleyan Center for Prison Education. This Thursday, February 5 at 12 p.m., in the Multi-Purpose Room in the basement of Usdan, members of our group will hold a public forum. If you have any questions or comments please email: WesleyanPrisonEducation@gmail.com. Sincerely,  The students of the Prisoner Solidarity Project"
"Argus: Is Prison a Theme Park?","2009-02-03","by Anna Wiener,","To the Editors of the Wesleyan Argus, Your editorial published on January 30, titled “Prison Experiment Is a Worthy One,” (Volume CXLV, Number 1) was well-intentioned but horribly misguided. Instead of providing support for an important and worthwhile campus initiative, you instead propagated a hateful, ignorant attitude toward incarcerated individuals. On top of that, you revealed yourselves to be navel-gazing and self-important, as well as wholly incapable of throwing your weight behind a project that, for once, does not place Wesleyan students on a golden pedestal. I’ll spare you an indictment of the egregious cartoon you published alongside your editorial, which single-handedly managed to be wildly offensive and casually align prisoners with Nazism (for those who missed this allusion: check out the swastika forehead tattoo). For these reasons, among others that I will outline shortly, it makes me deeply uncomfortable that you are in any position to represent Wesleyan’s student body. First of all, the project (not “experiment”) at the center of your editorial is not called the “Prison Solidarity Project.” It is the Prisoner Solidarity Project (PSP). Take a moment to reflect on the great disparity between these two meanings. Additionally, the fact that you published the name of the project incorrectly suggests that you did not even read the 1.5-page proposal issued by the PSP at last Monday’s symposium. Had you done the bare minimum required of any middling (perhaps aspiring?) journalist, you would have been able to correct your own glaring inconsistencies before allowing them to go to press. To address the meat of your argument point by point, let me begin by repeating a question you pose as one of your “ethical concerns:” “would Wesleyan want to sanction a program that provides inmates with such enormous benefits?” This question essentially asks whether or not incarcerated individuals are deserving of a college-level education. (What an “ethical concern” indeed!) You suggest that excluding the prison population from educational opportunities represents an ethical stance. Given the demographics of the prison population, it is safe to say that certain populations (poor, male, black, Latino) are systematically filtered into the prison system. You are therefore implying that these populations–both in and outside of prison–are undeserving of the same educational opportunities available to those enrolled in an institution like Wesleyan (which, coincidentally, happens to be private, expensive, and around 70 percent white). Adding insult to injury, you later state–with the naïve goodwill of a 17th century missionary–that you believe “the program will have a much greater impact if students, not just professors, get a chance to teach the incarcerated.” (“Get a chance” – really? Is prison a theme park?) Why do you believe this? What makes you think Wesleyan undergraduates are in any way qualified to teach college courses? Either way you slice it, this intimation is a slap in the face to Wesleyan professors, and an insult to those incarcerated. The PSP’s proposal to create a Center for Prison Education would further Wesleyan’s dual commitments to civic engagement and progressive education. Shame on you, Wesleyan Argus, for your painfully counter-productive contribution to this discussion."
"Wesleyan Center for Prison Education: Informal Proposal","2009-02-03","by Russell Perkins, on behalf of the Prisoner Solidarity Project","After many years of prisoner advocacy work by Wesleyan students and faculty, including the facilitation of academic workshops in two Connecticut correctional facilities, we propose the establishment of the Wesleyan Center for Prison Education.   The Center’s Plan: Two-Year College-in-Prison pilot program to be run in collaboration with Cheshire Correctional Institution.  Wesleyan Education at Cheshire: 15 inmates will be selected through a rigorous admission process to participate during the first year of the pilot program. Each student will enroll in 2 courses per semester. Courses will be taught by Wesleyan faculty. After two semesters, an additional 15 students will be admitted to the pilot program, producing a total of 30 program participants and 4 courses taught each semester. One transferable undergraduate credit will be awarded upon successful completion of each course. Prison Education at Wesleyan: A POI “Critical Pedagogy” service-learning seminar will be taught at Wesleyan in the fall semester. This course will involve a practicum component in which Wesleyan students tutor inmates that have not yet been accepted into the program. In addition to assisting participants to develop the essential capabilities that will prepare them for enrollment in credit-bearing courses, this component will aim to establish a mutually productive dialogue between Wesleyan students and those incarcerated. This program will be fully funded by private donors not currently drawn upon by Wesleyan University. Because of a conditional commitment from one such source, we are confident that funding will not jeopardize this program. The Center’s Mission: To practice Wesleyan’s commitment to civic engagement by offering college courses to incarcerated individuals, in order to enhance both Wesleyan’s academic community and the lives of those who are systematically denied access to educational opportunities. We believe that educational opportunity should be a fundamental right and recognize that a college education enables effective citizenship. As Wilbur Fisk wrote in 1831 and Wesleyan’s 2005 strategic plan reaffirmed, education serves two purposes: “the good of the individual educated and the good of the world.” This program embodies this core Wesleyan value and will demonstrate Wesleyan’s commitment to quality education, intellectual development and civic engagement.  We hope that you will support this potentially groundbreaking College-in-Prison program. If you have any questions or comments please email: WesleyanPrisonEducation@gmail.com."
"SDS Forum on Town-Gown Issues: Tear Down that Wall?","2009-02-06","by Miriam Berger, Assistant News Editor","“Right now I’d say that relations, town/gown relations, are better than they’ve been in the past,” said Professor of Sociology Rob Rosenthal. “But we can always do more.” What more the University community can and should do was the topic of debate at a town-gown forum organized by Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). At the forum, students and a panel of faculty members and representatives from the Center for Community Partnerships discussed the successes and challenges of University-Middletown relations from both a current and historical perspective. “I think that the point of a forum like that was to open up conversation about whether or not our campus is ‘open’ to folks who aren’t part of the greater Wesleyan community and to get a sense about how different folks on campus feel about that,” said Ruby-Beth Buitekant ’09. At the forum, students shared a number of criticisms of University policy, including concern over the perceived closed nature of the campus and the allocation of educational and recreational resources. Many felt that the University’s expulsion of unregistered guests has sent a hostile message to Middletown residents that is contrary to University aims. “By kicking people off you’re implying that they are not welcome,” said Zak Kirwood ’12, an SDS member. The policy of Public Safety (Psafe) officers concerning residents was also a topic of great concern. Students at the forum shared incidents in which they believe residents were unfairly removed from campus. Students expressed doubt over the criteria for expelling residents, citing examples in which it appeared that individuals were asked to leave arbitrarily and based on race and age. Director of Public Safety Dave Meyer, who did not attend the forum, stressed that this issue is neither easy to solve nor clear-cut. “There are all kinds of people on campus and we don’t just walk up to people on a regular basis and ask them for their ID,” Meyer said. “We do try to be very cautious when we approach someone and have a good reason for it. If we hear reports about suspicious people, we respond to them. Our response is based on the activity of the individual.” Meyer explained that many non-University students come to campus for a variety of reasons and that there is no policy refusing total access to residents. “If you look at Foss Hill on a Sunday afternoon when the hill is used for sledding, there’s probably more non-students than students,” Meyers said. Director of Community Relations Frank Kuan agreed that safety was definitely an issue for the University, students and parents. “Its really for your own safety,” Kuan said. “There are certain responsibilities that the University has in safe guarding buildings.”  Students, however, viewed this response with skepticism. “We couch it in terms of safety,” said Adam Jacobs ’10. “It’s not like all of Middletown will flood in. We assume that people are just going to come in and steal everything. It’s not like I’ve never had things stolen from my floor.” “I think there is a disconnect between how students on campus view the openness of campus and how people who are being asked to leave campus by PSafe view the openness of campus,” Buitekant said. “I think it’s a problem that the situation of people being asked to leave is up to individual decisions that impact the rest of campus.” The forum also touched upon ways that students could become more invested in Middletown, such as expanding housing to Middletown, making library resources more financially and easily accessible, or providing a point system on WesCards that incorporates Middletown stores. Currently, people unaffiliated with the University can, for a fee, apply for guest passes for Olin resources. Many of the issues and sentiments discussed benefited from the context provided by the panelists. Rosenthal described the history of Middletown and University relations throughout his 20 years on campus.  “It’s never been a ‘university’ town,” Rosenthal said. “There’s always been somewhat of a divide. You can’t wish away social structure.” According to Rosenthal, there is a common tendency among universities to ignore the specific needs of surrounding areas. He described the economic improvement of Middletown over the past two decades and lauded the University’s receptive behavior. He specifically noted the progressive work of former President Douglass Bennet who refrained from meddling in Middletown matters and implementing policies that could have promoted gentrification.  Kuan shared a similar sentiment. He explained that lack of connection and misinformation from both sides has been a common source of disharmony. “There has definitely been improvement in communication–if there are issues we can come to some sort of agreement,” Kuan said “We have to keep the focus on what can benefit the community and University and focus on our educational mission. I think any town relationship can still be improved.” Kuan cited examples of the campus opening up to residents—such as for school art shows and music festivals—and lamented that resources were too limited to be shared more uniformly among students and residents. “I think it is a good conversation,” Kuan said. “Students have great energy and we should work to capture that. In challenging economic times we have to work together on short-term, doable as well as mutually beneficial projects but should keep in mind that payouts [for student-driven projects] may not be immediate and could be longer-term.”    The panelists also noted other partnerships between the University and Middletown, such as the Center for Community Partnership, which finds opportunities for collaboration between University students and Middletown groups, and Service Learning classes, which incorporate Middletown-based projects into the curriculum. Additionally, the PILOTS program provides state reimbursement to Municipalities, such as Middletown, for unallocated taxes from tax-exempt properties and private institutions like Wesleyan. Yet some students questioned whether this was the most effective approach and addressed the root of the issues. “Is our having a lot of resources and using them to volunteer the only way in which we think of our relationship to Middletown?” Buitekant said. “I don’t think it should just be about volunteering.” Another consistent issue of discourse regarded the University allotment of resources. Jacobs questioned the University’s decisions and whether resources could have been better spent for the benefit of both the University and Middletown. “Wes just spent well over a million dollars to build a campus center that students don’t even enjoy…” Jacobs said. “I’m just saying…” Professor of History William Pinch, the third panelists, offered a different view of University town-gown relations.  “Too often a lot of what we hear is what Wesleyan has done for Middletown,” Pinch said. “It ends up creating an impression that Middletown can’t do anything for itself, that its just there and hopeless, a black hole that simply sucks resources from it [the University].” Pinch, a resident of Middletown, described the benefits of living in such a diverse and historic area. “From my perspective Wesleyan should be recruiting people to come here because it is in Middletown,” he said. Rosenthal too emphasized that interactions among students and residents are crucial for improving relations and suggested that they have already led to great improvements. “About every four years people get upset,” Rosenthal said. “Someone should take it on themselves to do research–where there are patterns, where there are exclusions.” SDS members plan to hold another town-gown forum this semester that will incorporate more Middletown residents in the dialogue, as well as press for changes and clarifications to PSafe policies."
"Pernick and Carlin Form New Outreach Committee","2009-02-27","by Jen Cohen, Staff Writer","In October of last semester, the WSA submitted a proposal to enhance the collaboration between students and administrators on University outreach. Last week, the newly formed University Outreach Committee—a product of Mike Pernick ’10 and Saul Carlin ’09, WSA President and Vice President, respectively—met for the first time. The committee, which consists of administrators and members of the WSA, will meet several times per semester to discuss the University’s image and ways of improving its communication. “Mike and I had been talking about strengthening University Relations between students and administrators [on this issue],” Carlin said.  “President Roth was really enthusiastic about the idea.” As the University Outreach Committee’s proposal states, “A sustained consultative relationship will enable productive, ongoing dialogue, and promote thinking that will foster creative, worthwhile, beneficial feedback on issues relating to university outreach.” According to Carlin, while University Relations has been successful, they could benefit from the input of students, who offer a different perspective than the administration. Both Pernick and Carlin agreed that collaboration on such issues is unprecedented. “The purpose of a university is for students,” Pernick said. “It is imperative to consult with the students who go here, [so that they] have a say in how the University portrays itself to the rest of the world.” During the first meeting, committee members discussed the ways in which the Internet can be utilized for reaching perspective students, current students, and alumni. Students provided insight into how Facebook, YouTube, and College Confidential can be used for marketing and social networking.  The committee also agreed on the importance of self-promotion through written and video testimonials. Members discussed the possibility of making course syllabi available on the website, so that perspective students can gain insight into coursework.  They also weighed the pros and cons of taping some classes and putting them on the Internet—a strategy used by several schools, such as MIT.  In the future, the committee will discuss admissions, town-gown relations, and press coverage.   The committee consists of four core members: President Michael Roth, Andy Tanaka, Assistant to the President for University Relations, Carlin, and Pernick.  Others present at the first meeting included administrators appointed by Roth, as well as three self-selected WSA members. New topics of discussion will bring in different students and administrators. According to Tanaka, the frequency of the meetings is flexible, but they will meet as often as necessary.   Committee members agree that the first meeting was a success. “The good news is we actually proved ourselves in these meetings,” Pernick said.  “We proved they are going to be worthwhile.”"
"MPD Intensifies Enforcement","2009-03-27","by Katherine Yagle, Assistant News Editor","The Middletown Police Department (MPD) is cracking down on underage drinking laws using an $85,000 grant received in 2006. The grant was obtained from the Connecticut Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services through the Rushford Center, a substance abuse and mental health provider in Connecticut. “We enforce the laws that already exist,” said Deputy Chief of Police Patrick McMahon in an e-mail to The Argus. “This enforcement grant allows us to be more proactive.” MPD is using the grant money to step up DUI patrols, enforcement of false identification laws and compliance checks for establishments that sell liquor.  “Local data indicated that the magnitude and severity of underage drinking in the Middletown community was high,” said Rushford’s Prevention Manager Sheryl Sprague, who applied for the grant, via e-mail. “We hope to reduce retail availability of alcohol to minors, increase enforcement of alcohol laws and policies and reduce social access to minors.” One of the largest issues that data collection in Middletown revealed was that minors in the community have considerable access to alcohol.  “Data regarding sale of alcohol indicate that Middletown bars, restaurants and stores far too often illegally sell alcohol to those under the legal age of 21,” Sprague said.  To address this issue, MPD is focusing not only on enforcing laws that affect minors who illegally purchase alcohol, but on ensuring that liquor vendors are not selling to anyone underage. This involves checking licenses of liquor-serving establishments and conducting compliance checks. Undercover compliance checks in 2006 identified four Middletown establishments that sold alchohol to two volunteer minors. Eli Wilson ’09, Beer Manager at Forest City Wines and Spirits on the north end of Main Street, believes the grant has the potential to benefit liquor stores if it provides better ways to identify minors. “As far as policing underage drinking, we are by law required to check ID,” he said. “[But] there is actually a fair amount of discretion involved. The state does not provide us with a concrete way of telling if an ID is fake or real. My manager feels that if the state wanted to be very serious about policing underage drinking, at least in terms of buying alcohol, they should provide us with some kind of booklet.” Wilson said he would like to see more collaboration between police and liquor vendors in order to help such establishments prevent sale of alcohol to minors. Forest City, he said, tries to enforce alcohol laws as best as possible; he has never personally seen someone turned away because of a fake ID, however.  Stricter enforcement of drinking laws could have many effects on University students. MPD has been in contact with Public Safety regarding the grant. “Students hosting large scale parties where alcohol is present have the obligation to uphold the law, including not providing alcohol to minors,”  Sprague said. “Under the social host law they can receive legal consequences for providing alcohol to those under 21, especially if high school age students are involved.” Under Connecticut General Statute 30-89a, allowing minors to drink on premises one has control over is an infraction for a first offense, and a misdemeanor for any subsequent offense. A misdemeanor can result in up to 12 months in jail.  In addition to the risks students 21 and over may face by hosting parties, the grant may influence the minors on campus. The grant focuses not only on the law enforcement, but also on compliance.  Sonia Mañjon, Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships, has provided information about the grant to WesWell. Mañjon meets with Middletown’s Mayor, Chief of Police, and Chief of Fire Department in a quarterly meeting to discuss town-gown relations. When she learned of tighter enforcement of alchohol laws, she passed the information along to Director of Health Education Lisa Currie. Sprague has also been working with WesWell to encourage students to drink safely and responsibly.   “We hope to reinforce health and safety messages,” she said. “Large scale parties where minors are providing or consuming alcohol will be addressed.” Despite the many ways the grant could influence the University, it is primarily focused on middle and high school students, according to Sprague.  “Students need to understand that this isn’t targeted at Wesleyan,” said Dave Meyer, Director of Public Safety. “It’s community-wide.” MPD, the Rushford Center and Public Safety agree that University students should be aware of the grant and its possible repercussions. They hope that it will result in increased compliance with underage drinking laws.  “Underage drinking is not a harmless rite-of-passage,” Sprague said. “More young people die of alcohol-related causes than all other illicit drugs combined. The societal costs of underage drinking are huge.”"
"Two Years In, Roth Looks Back","2009-05-05","by Katherine Yagle, Assistant News Editor","Argus: What do you feel you have accomplished in the face of the recession over these past two years? President Michael Roth: I think balancing the budget this year and creating a plan for long term sustainability has been a joint accomplishment of the faculty, students, trustees and staff. I was proud to lead that effort and try to bring our spending in relation to our resources. Being more prudent about our capital expenditures last year and this year has been very important. We have improved financial aid, reducing student indebtedness by 35 percent overall. The economy has prevented us from making as much progress as I’d hoped in many areas because we’ve been working on balancing the budget. I’ve spent a lot of time consulting with different constituencies, making sure we have enough to money to get through tough times. A: What are your goals for the future? MR: I would like to see Wesleyan become confident in its distinctiveness, sure of itself as a leader in American higher education, and articulate in expressing what we stand for. There are seven areas that have been the most important points of focus. The first is enhanced financial aid—when I first started we immediately changed the financial aid program to make it more generous to our neediest student, which I think is very important especially in light of the current recession. The second goal is investment in the sciences. We’ve postponed a major capital expense for our  new science building but we still need to invest in the sciences—and in people and in equipment. As the economy improves, I think we’ll be able to start doing just that. The third area is called curricular reform; I’ve focused on the first year and last year. I would like to see the first year experience to be much more of a cohort-building threshold experience, providing students with the sense that they’re in a different kind of place—some place unlike wherever they’ve studied before. The other thing I’ve mentioned is a senior capstone experience; eventually I’d like to see everybody graduating from Wesleyan accomplishing an independent project of some kind—not necessarily a scholarly thesis, but some kind of independent project to serve as a transition between Wesleyan and whatever comes next. The fourth goal is internationalization. Wesleyan has had approximately seven percent of its students from outside the US; I’d like to see that doubled over several years. I also want to make sure the curriculum is as international and cosmopolitan as possible. It has to be a faculty-led process whereby we examine each sector of the curriculum to ensure that the education our students are getting what prepares them to be global citizens, not just members of the US economy and culture. The next two areas are things people have long said about Wesleyan students that I’m not convinced we have anchored in our curriculum. The first is that we’re an activist bunch, with a lot of politics on campus. Rather than try to run away from that image, I think we should embrace it. Wes students should learn how to be more effective neighbors and citizens, more effective at civic engagement because of their time on campus. The other thing people say about Wesleyan students is that we’re a creative bunch. I want to make sure that creativity is actually an innovation, plugged into the curriculum, so that it’s not just for the studio art majors but something that is accessible for everyone. In every department, there are ways I believe we can help people become more creative or at least be more aware of the creative possibilites. The last area is the College of the Environment, which we’ve taken a big step towards an obligatory linked major, which has just been approved by the faculty. Eventually, I’d like that to become our new College of the Environment. We have the College of Social Studies and the College of Letters, both of which are celebrating their 50th anniversaries. It’s the perfect time to start the College of the Environment. All of these are attempts to take what Wesleyan students stand for and to try to make us better and more serious about those things. It’s important for the President to talk about these initiatives in the public sphere, and so I’ve spent a fair amount of time trying to share what Wesleyan stands for, traveling around the country meeting with alumni, giving speeches, and writing for the Huffington Post and the Los Angeles Times. A: In what ways has Wesleyan changed since you were a student? MR: I think there’s a spirit at Wesleyan that’s remained strong. This sense of practical idealism, of people who have great ambition and dream big but learn to acquire skills that allow them to operate in the world and to make stuff happen—this was characteristic of Wesleyan in the seventies and is still so. Things that have changed…the role of parents has changed enormously since I was a student. My parents heard from me once a week—now there are students who call their parents before they call their advisor. I don’t think it’s a sign of the strength of the family, but a sign that people are not allowed to grow up. Parents are concerned and parents are often paying, but the fact is that students are adults. But this isn’t a Wesleyan change—it’s a national change. Wesleyan has a lot more school spirit now than when I was a student, and I think that’s a good thing. I belonged to Alpha Delta Phi and I was very involved with the activities of the fraternity but I’d never heard the fight song—I didn’t even know there was a fight song! Wesleyan students sing it not so much with irony as with glee. Of course, part of the student culture is oppositional and that’s also a very good thing, but I think we express our school spirit more freely today than in the past. A: What was your experience at Wesleyan like? MR: I was involved in some political things but I was very serious about my studies. I was only here three years so I had a lot to do quickly. I worked in the kitchen at Alpha Delt, so I was there late at night and early in the morning. I wanted to be a writer so I wrote short stories and poetry, some of which were published in Hermes. I volunteered in a hospital psychiatric ward, I tutored an elementary school kid, I was a senior interviewer, I was a T.A. in psychology. Now that I think about it, I wonder how I had the time, but there were just so many interesting things to do. A: What does Wesleyan stand for to you? MR: This is what I hope to be talking about with students and faculty over the next year. To me, Wesleyan represents a progressive liberal arts education, meaning that it’s a leader in higher education and that other people follow what we do. I suppose one way to think about Wesleyan’s future is that we want to be a better school, richer, more selective, but that’s boring to me. Wesleyan isn’t just another liberal arts college that’s hard to get into. We have stood for something special, for creativity, for political engagement, for a research-oriented curriculum. These are qualities to build on in the future. A: What do you think are the greatest challenges going into next year? MR: There are still great economic challenges to giving people the resources they need to be great at what they do. There are cultural challenges in getting people to think: “What does the University as a whole stand for?” Sometimes it’s very hard for someone in one field to talk to someone in another, so we have to find ways of bridging that. I disagree with anyone who says we should just be a small teaching school. At Wesleyan, our teaching is great because our research is deep. Research shouldn’t isolate us—it should give us more ways of linking to one another.  A: What plans do you have to address the budgetary crisis in the future? MR: I would like to see Wesleyan much more economically secure than we are today. The short term goal is to put spending in line with resources, which we’ve almost done. The long term goal is to increase economic capacity so that we know that the important things are here to stay. I would like to see a much larger portion of the financial aid program endowed, so at the next campaign I hope to raise a couple hundred million dollars. It’s not just about raising money to spend in a year, but saving and investing so that over time our financial aid program will be secure. We have created emergency funds through cost-cutting and we have tried to show our donors that we are responsible and creative stewards of generosity. A lot of what I’ve talked about—the core values, what we stand for—are  good in themselves but if we do them well we will also inspire generosity. Communication about these values and programs is really important; we need more people around the world to know that we have something very special at this university. A: Overall, what are your feelings about your first two years as president? MR: I’m not satisfied. There are things I’m proud of, I’ve made some mistakes, I joke around a lot and sometimes say things I shouldn’t say. As President, I want to show respect for all members of the Wesleyan community. I think I can do more to help the University realize its potential and I think I have to be an even better listener. As you can see, I like to talk, but I really want to be a good listener so I can understand what students, alumni, faculty, trustees, and staff think about where we’re going. The more I can understand other points of view, the more effective I’ll be as a leader."
"Editorial: Bucking Bureaucracy","2009-09-15","by ,","We find it deeply distressing that an organization like Food Not Bombs faces legal challenges. Not only does the organization provide food for Middletown’s hungry on Sundays, when soup kitchens are closed, but it also plays a significant role in easing tensions between the University and the Middletown community. Students’ involvement with Food Not Bombs is an excellent example of engagement with the Middletown community, and it is a paradigm for how our mutual relationship can improve. Rather than condemn Food Not Bombs, the Middletown Health Department should recognize the organization’s contributions to the community, much of which lacks access to fresh, healthy food. Rather than get mired in arbitrary bureaucratic decisions, the Department should work to find a way for Food Not Bombs to continue its work. In fact, the Board may be legally bound to exempt Food Not Bombs from the Health Code.  We accept Food Not Bombs’ argument that it is not organized as a charitable organization, but that it is simply a group of people sharing a meal. In a profoundly unequal society, people should be allowed to share whatever they choose without hindrance.  Middletown’s chapter of Food Not Bombs is not the only chapter to be unjustly hindered. In July 2006, an ordinance was passed in Orlando that required its local chapter to pay for a permit in order to provide food to more than 25 people in the city’s parks. A lawsuit was filed in October 2006 against the ordinance, and after 2 years of protest, a federal judge ruled in favor of Food Not Bombs.  While that story saw a happy ending, many other Food Not Bombs chapters, including ours, may not be so lucky. The idea that the whim of local bureaucracy could squelch an organization that has been feeding hungry people in Middletown for over a decade should be distressing to us all. We urge the University community to support Food Not Bomb’s appeal by attending the hearing, going to Board of Health meetings, and participating in Food Not Bombs’ work."
"Construction Updates","2009-09-18","by Adam Rashkoff, Contributing Writer","While students were away from campus this summer, the University was hard at work preparing for the 2009-2010 school year. Below is a brief overview of some of the construction projects that you may not have noticed. Hood Fans in Senior Houses In an attempt to reduce the number of fire alarm activations due to cooking smoke, 43 hood fans were installed in senior woodframes. An outside electrical contractor installed 24 hood fans, and in-house electricians installed 19. These fans were installed in as many locations as the $20,000 allotted by the annual major maintenance program allowed. Judd Hall Lab Renovations Construction services renovated a psychology lab for new Assistant Professor Charles Sanislow. The project took place on a fast track schedule beginning on Aug. 5 and was completed on Sept. 4. The project consisted of demolishing a concrete-encased steel beam mezzanine structure inside of the old Room 307, which previously housed storage space above and a few post-doctorate and graduate student offices below. From the old drawings it appeared that the mezzanine was added to the building in one of its renovations over the years to add additional space. With the mezzanine removed, new spaces were built consisting of two assessment rooms, an observation and data processing room and a ten-seat seminar room. The lab will be fully operational by the end of the month once wiring is completed for computers and audio-visual equipment. Roof Repairs Beginning in April, Associate Director of Construction Services Roseann Sillasen and Assistant Director of Building Trades Tom Policki addressed repairs needed on a number of roofs throughout campus. Restoration plans are developed and carried out as roof deficiencies are identified. This year, a number of replacements and repairs have been carried out. Notable buildings that have undergone work include a number of senior woodframes, North College, and Olin Library. Allbritton Applies for LEED Gold Status The newly opened Allbritton Center is applying to the United States Green Building Council for LEED Gold Status. According to its website, the Council is a “non-profit community of leaders working to make green buildings available to everyone within a generation,” and “LEED certification provides independent, third-party certification that a building project meets the highest green building and performance measures.” This environmental focus parallels Allbritton Center’s commitment to social engagement. The range for Gold in the LEED category of New Construction is 39 to 51 credits and Allbritton is applying with 47."
"Chung on Fashion: Getting Mad","2009-09-22","by Allyson Chung, Blargus Fashion Critic","My cardinal spirit was in full effect this past Sunday when Matthew Weiner ’87, the creator of the series Mad Men, walked away with two Emmy awards for both best drama, and for writing. Since its premiere in July of 2007, the show has taken home the best drama award two years in a row, wowing audiences with its refreshing and unique script, drop dead gorgeous actors, and escapist nostalgia for times not that long ago.  Though I know nothing about the advertising industry, I do know classic fashion and Mad Men is a prime example of impeccably polished, classically American, and historically accurate fashion. From Don Draper’s suits, Joan Harris’ waist cinching sheaths, and even little Sally Draper’s madras midriffs, each week I am in awe of the varying color palate and precise tailoring exhibited on every member of the cast. Costume designer Janie Bryant purchases and creates vintage pieces to bring the men and women of Mad Men to life.  Showing a keen eye for refined fit on varying body types while still harnessing old American glamour, Bryant has invigorated an already thriving vintage and consignment market. Though shopping vintage has the potential to break the bank, Bryant claims that some of her best finds came from a Salvation Army in midtown Manhattan. While the retail industry has seen a marked decline in consumer spending in light of the economic downturn, establishments like Salvation Army and Goodwill are seeing an increase in traffic from shoppers of all economic classes.  Though finding Betty Draper’s nightgown could prove damn near impossible, there are many treasures to behold in a local thrift store, especially in Middletown. I suggest digging through the crates if you’re trying to save some cash. Having worked as a costume designer last year, stores like Never Say Goodbye and Trusted Servant offer up an array of gowns, men’s’ apparel, and accessories that hearken back to the days of drinking on the job and smoking while pregnant. A fashion favorite of Wesleyan students, cocktails dresses, costume jewelry and Dior sports coats are common finds at these hot spots.  The rumor mill suggests that there may be a line inspired by Mad Men in the works, but if you want to get a head start on creating your own ’60s ensembles, look no further than the aisles of the nearest thrift shop.                 \r       \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\tAbout amchung\r       \t\t\t\t\tAllyson Chung is a member of the Class of 2010.

"Battle in the Chapel: Middletown Mayoral Candidates Duke It Out On Campus","2009-10-09","by Jen Cohen , Staff Writer","The University hosted Middletown’s first official mayoral debate between Republican incumbent Sebastian Giuliano and Democratic challenger Dan Drew on Tuesday. Students and Middletown residents headed to Memorial Chapel where the candidates answered questions on the City’s shrinking budget, Food Not Bombs, transportation, and the University’s relationship with Middletown. Independent candidate Ruth Ann Johnson was unable to participate in the event. The debate was moderated by Lily Mandlin ’10, who spent the first hour asking the candidates pre-selected questions submitted by the University community and various Middletown groups. Throughout the debate, Drew criticized Giuliano’s tax increases and Middletown Police Department’s job cuts, emphasizing the need for new leadership. Giuliano accused the Democratic council of stretching the city’s limited financial resources and blocking his efforts to improve conditions. The candidates took opposing sides on the Middletown Health Department’s decision to shut down Food Not Bombs. “I’m glad the state acted,” Giuliano said.  “[It] took actions that were pursuant with the public health code.” He added that the state legislature created the problem through their rigid wording of the public health code. Drew disagreed, calling the city’s actions excessive. “[The state used] undue force for groups that were looking to feed the hungry, feed the needy in a time when people needed it the most,” he said. When asked about the future of town-gown relations, Drew promised to keep lines of communication open by meeting regularly with President Roth and University students. Giuliano countered that such communication already exists. “What is really important is to get students involved,” Giuliano said, suggesting that students could fill some vacancies on the City Board. The candidates spent much of the debate discussing Middletown’s budget, which has been hit hard by the economic crisis and has become burdened by increasing demands. “[We need] to take a look at the budget line by line and determine what our priorities are,” Drew said. “We have to be careful not to cut things that make Middletown what it is.” When Mandlin asked about community dissatisfaction with public transportation, both candidates agreed that this area needs improvement. “The next thing on the table is to get rid of the car, because we are an urban district,” Giuliano said. Giuliano discussed plans for a rail system. Drew said he hopes to improve the bus system and to implement a small trolley-like transportation system. On several occasions, Drew accused Giuliano of reneging on his promise not to raise taxes. “This man pledged to be a tax-cutter coming into office,” Drew said. “He is anything but. There should never be an inverse relationship between the services you receive and the tax increases.” Giuliano said that the budgetary review is a line-by-line process. He stressed that the city council is primarily responsible for the city budget and spending, and that since the Democrats have held an 8-4 majority, there has been a major gap between revenue and spending. Giuliano also said that Drew’s policies would send Middletown further down a path of increased taxes. The candidates’ opinions differed the most in their views on the decision to cut six police officers from the Middletown Police Department. When questioned on how to combat crime in the city and at the University, Drew expressed the need for increased police presence, and repeatedly criticized the mayor’s decision. Giuliano stressed that while he is dedicated to public safety, he is pessimistic that the police academy can be filled to capacity. In their closing statements, the candidates continued to point out faults in their opponent’s platforms. “If we look back at the mayor’s record, we see promises broken,” Drew said. “We need a leader who is looking towards the future.” Giuliano, in turn, criticized the Democratic Party. “One thing that will ensure a better future is not to do the same thing that created the situations of the present,” Giuliano countered. “I think [Drew’s] party is heading down the same road. Someone told me the path of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. We need to stop mortgaging our future and start paying it off.”"
"Cardinal’s Night on Main Street","2009-10-20","by Jen Cohen , Staff Writer","This spring, Wesleyan students and Middletown residents will have a chance to mingle during “The Cardinal’s Night on Main Street,” an event that aims to encourage school spirit and town-gown relations. The Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA)’s Community Outreach Committee (COCo) is sponsoring the event, which will take place at the Riverview Center on Main Street and will feature student musicians and a table run by COCo. The Ride will provide transportation for students from campus to Main Street. Main Street restaurants will be selling food at tables at the center and offering 10 to 20 percent discounts to students. Their menus will be circulated on campus shortly before the event. Featured establishments will include La Boca, It’s Only Natural, Cold Stone, and others. “By integrating Middletown residents and Wesleyan students, [we hope to show] that we are friendly to their business,” said COCo Chair Sylvie Stein ’12. Originally planned for Oct. 17, the event was postponed after the Middletown Police Department was unable to provide electricity for that date. The WSA has now pushed the event to the spring because of Middletown’s Holiday Event on Main Street, which will involve restaurants that do not want to offer student discounts during that week."
"Giuliano Beats Drew, Begins Third Term as Mayor","2009-11-06","by Amanda Schwartz, Assistant News Editor","On Tuesday, the Republican incumbent Middletown Mayor Sebastian Giuliano beat his Democratic challenger, Dan Drew, to enter his third term. Although the City is predominantly Democratic, Giuliano received 4,388 votes in comparison to Drew’s 3,902. Ruthann Johnson of the Realistic Balance Party received 104 votes. Giuliano attributed the win to his track record for the past two terms. “What got me re-elected was pretty much how I conducted myself and this office for the last four years,” Giuliano said in an interview with The Argus. Polls opened at 6 a.m. on Tuesday morning at 14 polling locations throughout the City. Most students voted at the Senior Center on William Street, which accounts for District 14 in Middletown. The polling station, which went to Drew, reported a turnout of 23.4  percent of registered voters in the District. The citywide turnout was 36 percent of 23,511 total registered voters. Although this is an increase from the 31.9 percent in 2007 when Giuliano ran unopposed, it is a sharp decline from 2005 when Giuliano was first elected with 45.9 percent voter turnout. Giuliano explained that a large part of his campaign efforts focused on convincing Middletown residents to actually vote. “I was kind of uneasy throughout the entire campaign; I kept on hearing, ‘Oh you’re in. Oh, you’re a shoe-in,’” Giuliano said. “Usually when that kind of sentiment is going around, it tends to depress turnout. You kind of open yourself up for a sneak attack.” Giuliano characterized voter turnout on Tuesday as average. Drew, however, felt that voter turnout was low and that this may have contributed to his loss. “If turnout had been a little bit higher I think we could have had a better a chance of winning, but I’m really proud of how far we came,” Drew said in an interview with The Argus. Giuliano had strongest support in the residential districts of the city located in the west and south, whereas Drew carried the center of the city. Last month, the University hosted the first official mayoral debate between Giuliano and Drew. Issues broached included the City’s declining budget, Food Not Bombs, and the University’s relationship with Middletown. President Michael Roth reported that he voted on Tuesday. He stressed the importance of University town-gown relations. “I hope that we continue to increase the positive communication that we’ve been having with the City of Middletown from the mayor to the City Council to the School Board,” he said. “A lot of things are going on. It has been a steady improvement over the last year and a half or so and I expect that to continue.” Both the Wesleyan Democrats (WesDems) and the Wesleyan College Republicans (WCR) campaigned for their parties’ respective candidates on campus and throughout Middletown. The weekend before the election both groups stepped up their efforts, making calls to both students and Middletown residents to encourage them to vote. This year, 226 University students registered to vote in Middletown, bringing the total number to 753 University students, according to the Middletown registrar. Of the 753 students, 546 are registered as Democrats, 17 as Republicans, 186 are unaffiliated, and four are registered as other. “If Wesleyan [students] turned out in the numbers that they could have, it would have been a smaller margin [between Giuliano and Drew], because there were so many registered Democratic voters, assuming they voted along party lines,” said Alex Levin ’12, President of the WCR. Both groups encouraged students to register to vote in Connecticut, despite hesitancy from some students on transferring voter registration from their home states. “A lot of students think that because they’re only here for four years [it is not necessary to vote in Middletown elections],” said President of WesDems Corinne Duffy ’11. “But it is four years of your life, and it’s as much our home for four years as the community that you’re from. And it’s important to make any community that you’re in better.” Levin explained that the WCR’s involvement in the campaign demonstrated the role students could play in local politics. “I think [Giuliano is] starting to realize how much more of an impact Wesleyan students can have on municipal elections—not that he didn’t care before,” Levin said. “Especially now with the WSA’s [Wesleyan Student Assembly] debate he knows we’re paying attention to local politics more. I only see participation growing in the next couple years, not diminishing.” Although Duffy expressed disappointment in Drew’s loss, she felt that the WesDems still made an impact. “We showed the City that we are a political force and we are willing to take a stand for elections,” she said. Post-election, Drew has not given up his commitment to Middletown and said he may run again in 2011. “I’m going to stay involved and keep working on behalf of the community,” Drew said. “There’s a very good opportunity I may run again in two years.”"
"Mytheology: You ARE Wesleyan?!","2009-11-20","by Mytheos Holt ,","Author’s Note: The following document was submitted to the author by an anonymous source in the Admissions Office*. It contains the original drafts of what are now the Admissions and Campus Life web pages. ADMISSIONS: Are You Wesleyan? Do you contemplate infinity for the fun of it? If so, ask us about Eclectic, where you can not only contemplate infinity, but depending on how much you can afford to spend on controlled substances, you can see it as regularly as every week! Do you have a new favorite book every week? Do you have a new favorite genre every week? Do you have a new favorite self every week? If you answered yes to the first question, ask us about the College of Letters, where your interest in every favorite book you’ve ever had will be slowly and agonizingly slaughtered. If you answered yes to the second question, ask us about the Film Department, where everyone’s lives are henceforth defined by either the tragedy or comedy genre depending on what shoes they wore when they first met Jeanine Basinger. If you answered yes to the last question, ask us about the Office of Behavioral Health. Do you quote Hume, Hegel and Homer Simpson accurately, but intentionally misquote fellow students with whom you disagree? If so, Wesleyan’ chapter of Students for a Democratic Society would love to have you! If you were an automobile, would you be a converted hybrid? If so, would you be interested in participating in our new “Cap & Gown for Clunkers” Exchange student program? Do neuroscience, dance and history seem like a logical combination? If so, have fun finding an advisor for your senior thesis on “The Psychology of Restless Leg Syndrome as a Cultural Artifact of Riverdance.” Also expect to only get honors on it. And expect nobody to read it. Not even your thesis readers. Do you surf the library? Can you understand how to use the library website? If so, congratulations, you have just been hired as an IMS technician! Do you find patterns in complexity? If so, does our housing system make ANY sense to you?! Would you stay up all night to make friends for life? Would you spend that night in bed with the person you’re trying to make friends for life with? If so, prepare to become famous on the Anonymous Confession Board. Oh, and ask us about Westco. Do you expect to spend your whole life learning? If so, we do not recommend a career in academia, so consider getting your degree in something which will actually help you in the job market. Are you actually qualified to attend this school? If so, get ready to spend the next four years feeling guilty for being such a tool of the patriarchal, racist, classist, heterosexist, monoculturalist, religion-obsessed, speciesist, Eurocentric system. Or join the College Republicans. Are you the sort of person whose accomplishments are so vast that they can’t be summed up in two-minute over-produced video clip? Watch us try anyway! CAMPUS LIFE: Most Wesleyan students probably do about seven things at one time, and have great difficulty knowing which of them to put on their resume. Three might be academic tasks, such as skimming the reading, doing work the night before it’s due, and requesting extensions because you have a protest tomorrow. Two of them might involve student organizations, such as WesKINK and Advocates for Satan, and two might be community service or political engagement, either of which could involve drawing dildos on the sidewalk or campaigning for nonstarter local candidates. Another endeavor might be playing on one of Wesleyan’s athletic teams or club sports, but really, we’d rather not talk about that because most of us got picked last in gym class anyway. Or just having a cup of Joe in the Usdan Center, and then feeling embarrassed that the website authors never learned the definition of a sentence fragment. Or maybe it’s cooking a vegan potluck and then having no one want to eat any of it…watching a film in one of the country’s best projection facilities which can’t even get the sound right sometimes…using WiFi (or hallucinogens, whichever’s easiest to pay for) while watching a baseball game from Foss Hill. Or meditating and exploring religious and spiritual activities, but since this campus routinely gets ranked one of the most atheist in the country, we doubt you’ll be doing that unless you’re a “stupid, backwoods Christian hick.” Or create your own favorite activities for multitasking. That’s what Wesleyan students do. *Actually, this document is wholly a work of fiction—given that no Admissions office employee would ever draft anything so honest, even in jest."
"Become a Part of a Living Legacy","2009-12-08","by Lily Mandlin,","Each year, I find it gets harder to fight my own cynicism.  Each class, each reading, each discussion I have at Wesleyan leaves me feeling all the more certain that there are more problems in this world that even an entire college of well-intentioned, educated, and smart students and professors can fix.  It’s disheartening to say the least.  But to a few students and staff members, these impasses are not dead-ends.  Instead, a roadblock is a signal for a better plan, a call for inspiration and perspiration.  More often than not, I’m one of those students. Wesleyan is full of people who would like to “do good.” Many even pursue these ends to some degree.  Some take it to another level, making a change in a community that is their own or in which they identify some need that they can address.  The work of “public service” or “community engagement” can seem thankless from the outside.  Why a person truly does what he or she does is a question that reaches beyond my own contemplation.  What motivates a “good deed” is only our best guess. But in the simplest terms, a volunteer or an activist does what she or he does because they see it needs to be done and that they can do it, if they just tried a little harder.  Sometimes you have to try more than a little hard—sometimes despite your personal flame fueling the project, it still fails.  And that failure may be, again, the end for many.  But for some, it’s another beginning, an envisioning of the process or a reevaluation of the better ends of the project. If you know of someone on this campus who fits that description, they may be a candidate for the Peter Morganstern-Clarren Award for Social Justice.  Your friend or mentor may be the person who always pushes a little more than most when something needs to get done, who volunteers when it does not clearly benefit them, who moves you to be better and work harder at your own endeavors. And if that “type of person” is you, then you’ve recognized perhaps what’s most important about public service. Public service is mutualism—that you do what you do because it drives you. The parents of Peter Morganstern-Clarren ’03 created an award to honor their son, a Wesleyan student who worked tirelessly for labor issues and organized the Wesleyan community in support of his ideals.  Sophomores and Juniors who follow, perhaps unknowingly, in his footsteps are eligible to apply for this award.  Staff members are eligible and can be nominated by a student, or students, who have been touched by their presence in their lives.  Both staff and student awards come with a financial gift.  As last year’s selected student, I felt both honored by the recognition of the selection committee and grateful for this generous gift.  I urge all students who believe they are eligible to apply and all students who know of a member of Wesleyan’s staff who be a fitting recipient to nominate them. The award has been, for me, not only a recognition of past endeavors, but another push forward towards more work to come.  The award bears the name of beloved and honored student and thus, his legacy.  It is not only a gift recognizing work that has been done, but a sign of faith that the recipient will carry on public service work into the future. Recipients of the Peter Morganstern-Clarren award move forward with their acts of social justice to honor an activist whose vision endures beyond his life.  While seeking a professional career in an economy that has left no one untouched by strife, the knowledge that the Peter Morganstern-Clarren selection committee had confidence in me compels me to continue to seek more opportunities to make positive contributions. For more information about the Peter Morganstern-Clarren Awards for Social Justice (either employee or student prize) please contact Dean Marina Melendez at mmelendez@wesleyan.edu.  If you seek advice on the application process, you’re welcome to contact me at lmandlin@wesleyan.edu. All nominations must be in by February 26, 2010."
"Mytheology (Wesleyan Viewed From the Right…and the West Coast): A Joint Partnership","2009-12-26","by Mytheos Holt, Ancient Conserva-Blarger","Author’s Note: Observing the current controversy over the election of Mr. Giant Joint, it has become immediately apparent to me that a brief exit from my Winter Break oasis of literary isolation in the California hills is not only appropriate, but essential. Though my original plan had been to leave the topic for my first column of the second semester, it is important to strike while the iron is hot, or, to use a more apt metaphor, to inhale while the joint is still lit, so I will make one exception to my “no columns during breaks” rule and submit this. This Christmas morning, fresh from a lovely and long sleep on West Coast time, I awoke to find a precious gift waiting under the tree – a first edition, signed copy of H.L. Mencken’s Notes on Democracy, a document which contains many exceedingly well-taken insights on the peculiar American political neurosis of which the title speaks. Mr. Mencken observes, for instance, that “Democracy is the art and science of running the circus from the monkey cage.” Harsh though this statement is, I must admit to feeling a sort of ghoulish joy upon reading it, given the context of the election of a Mr. Giant Joint to the Wesleyan Student Assembly. Before proceeding with this column, however, let me take the time to congratulate Mr. Joint on his victory after so many soul-crushing defeats, and also to assure him that I bear him no ill will whatsoever for besting me in the 2010 Class Representative election of a few years ago. If one proposes to try to stand in the way of history, one must be prepared to get crushed occasionally (much as Alan Keyes did when he attempted to stop the juggernaut known as Barack Obama), and I am confident that trying to compete with Mr. Joint is one such case (not to mention I am sure that he will make for an infinitely wiser legislator than Mr. Obama). However, it appears that, in a true example of politically motivated cruelty, many of my peers have begun trying to wrest Mr. Joint’s victory from him before he can properly enjoy it. They raise such superfluous objections as the idea that Mr. Joint is not a Wesleyan student (an utterly moot point, given that I suspect these same people voted for President Obama, who, as we all know from his speeches, professes to be a citizen of the world rather than the United States), and also that his election “degrades” the WSA. Ironically, I find myself in complete agreement with this latter charge (though perhaps not with its terminology), yet this is one reason why I think Mr. Joint’s seating is not only necessary, but that to do otherwise would constitute a severe miscarriage of justice. Mr. Joint emphatically should be seated – not as a monument to the joyful success of Democracy, but as a living, breathing, smoking symbol of its inevitable teleological descent into mediocrity and apathetic, puerile childishness, at the dreadful point where civic engagement has become nothing but a postmodern practical joke. Not merely that, but his solemnly wafting presence in the halls of power should serve as a powerful reminder to the WSA itself of its own complete irrelevance, and the fire of his sizzling, contraband conviction should amply achieve the valuable task of puncturing the slowly swelling balloon of insular self-importance which pervades that institution. Practiced readers of this column will have to forgive the cynicism of my old age, but the recent uselessness of the WSA over my four years here is a topic which has been scandalously ignored, to the detriment of Wesleyan students everywhere. If nothing else, Mr. Joint has done us all a service by bring it to the fore, and exposing these self-important elections for the sham that they are – every year, a portion of our parents’ hard-earned tuition money, or of our much pleaded for student loans, or in some cases of our own money gets poured into the WSA, with the express purpose of funding student activities, student government, and some variant thereof. The WSA is even given its own office within Usdan, as though it were an arm of the administration (which at times, it may as well be). And what does the WSA do with its hallowed money and its specifically allocated office in Usdan, besides supply us with a convenient free photocopier, red-stamping Michael Roth’s rampage through our endowment, caving to insane protestors calling for the university to mortgage its future in the name of some nebulously defined abstraction known only by the saccharine name of “social responsibility” and allowing the smarmiest members of the exact same groups on-campus to bolster their resumes year after year? What they do is waste our money on pointless new committees, squander it by creating new “funds” with socially conscious names and then by asking us to approve them in costly elections ex post facto, violating the rules they write for themselves and then changing those after the fact, and generally allow a collection of shamelessly amateurish politicos to cut their pork barrel teeth squabbling over a pot of forcefully expropriated money! And let’s not forget telling us to respect organizations designed to trample all over every Western notion of due process with Orwellian “speech codes” and bizarre rulings! Unfair? Perhaps, but harsh though my assessment may be of the reasons for the WSA’s farcical perception among the student population, one cannot deny that the perception exists, given the election of Mr. Joint. To be sure, part of the problem is the general apathy and childishness of a student body for whom posts on the ACB constitute meaningful political discourse, but let us confine ourselves to problems we can actually solve. I, for one, do not think that students find it easy to view the WSA elections with any sort of dignity at all at the point where many candidacy statements – especially the ones which, God forbid, try to be funny – are such an affront to our intelligence. In any case, Mr. Joint’s election should be respected as the exercise in legitimate, commonplace Democratic decision-making that it is. If nothing else, it will save the members of the WSA the trouble of indulging their tastes for illicit substances outside the conference room, and perhaps – just perhaps – Mr. Joint’s tenure will be sufficiently unimpressive, and the WSA’s performance will be that much improved, that students can be induced to give a damn about his seat again. In the meantime, Mr. Joint should remain elected as a warning to all members of the WSA currently serving that there, but for the grace of God, incumbency and devoted friends go they.                 \r       \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\t      \t\t\t\t\tAbout Ezra Silk\r       \t\t\t\t\tI have been interested in journalism ever since I was an editor at my high school student newspaper, where I was involved in a freedom of speech controversy that was covered in the local newspaper as well as local television and radio outlets.

I have written over 70 stories at the Argus and continue to do reporting and blogging as much as I can."
"Four Keywords for Haiti: Duty, Dehumanization, Trauma & Creative Survivalism","2010-01-26","by Professor Gina Athena Ulysse,","Amid Rubble and Ruin, Our Duty to Haiti Remains Words are especially difficult to come by in a state of numbness.  My response to the outpouring of calls and emails from concerned friends had become something of a mantra. No, still no news yet. We have not been able to make contact with anyone. To stay sane, I resigned myself to accepting that my immediate family would not come out of this without loss. And even if we had, the lives of the already departed and sheer magnitude of the devastation were enough to keep me catatonic. You see, I was just in Haiti the week before Christmas. I went to the Ghetto Biennale of the Grand Rue artists. I returned from what I boasted was my best trip ever, full of hope about the future. The reason for my optimism was encounters with people from Cité Soleil. Through INURED, a research institute, I met ten students who received scholarships to study in Brazil and members of a community forum that has been actively engaged in dialogue in attempts to build broader coalition beyond politics. Their work renewed my dedication to participate in building the country again. I made a commitment to raise funds to make sure both of these efforts are successful. Hope is not something that one often associates with Haiti. An anthropologist and critic of representations of the island, I have often questioned narratives that reduce Haiti to simple categories and in the process dehumanize Haitians. Yes, we may be the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere, but there is life there, love and an undeniable and unbeatable spirit of creative survivalism. I have heard cries of “why Haiti?” and “why now?” or “this could have been avoided.” Narratives of blame may be explanatory but at this time they are not constructive. Since our inception as a sovereign state early in the 19th century, we have faced obstacles. We have had to build and rebuild before. I am worried about Haiti’s future. In the immediate moment we need help, rescue missions of all kinds. I am already concerned about weeks from now when we are no longer front-page news. Without long-term efforts, we will simply not be able to rebuild. What will happen then? My first response to seeing post-quake pictures of the capital was to ask how they will build factories with this devastation. In the last year, the UN and Special Envoy Bill Clinton’s plans to help develop the country’s economy have virtually ignored dissent on the ground that called for a more humane approach that would not recreate the same exploitative labor relations that continue to serve the wealthy. Haiti’s government, with its absence of structure, cannot be ignored as it is in desperate need of reinforcement and civil space needs to be nurtured. The folks I met last month had one response when I asked why, despite their personal hardships, they chose to engage in community building. In Kreyol or in French, they replied: “C’est mon Devoir” (it is my duty). I was charmed by the phrase, its elegance and matter-of-factness. On this side of the water, I hold onto their words today as a sign that there is will in Haiti.  When long-term efforts are on the way, the international community, too, must see it as their duty to not recreate the mistakes of the past. Haiti Will Never Be the Same It is still difficult to absorb the images. Though I have now heard from family members, I experience symptoms of trauma, mainly dissociation—my mind seeks sporadic distances from my body as this is simply too much for my psyche to bear. Unlike those glued to their screens, I turned off the television.  I have that luxury. Yet, I keep thinking of those who cannot. If, with over 1600 miles between us, this is my reaction, then what must it be like for people who are in the thick of it in Haiti? Since its inception as a free black state in 1804, Haiti has been fragile. If the earthquake that devastated the capital last week has revealed anything else, it is that the country has a weak and barely functioning state and virtually no infrastructure. Of course, that is not news to those who know Haiti: it has always been the case. How it got that way tells us why efforts to rebuild Haiti must take a different course. And this simply cannot be understood without some references to the island’s history. Since independence, most politicians have followed a simple rule: build coalition to oust the enemy, then disband as they had done with the French. Freedom came at a price. The young Republic’s sovereignty was compromised in critical ways that continue to affect it today. Early on, it was crippled by debt — an indemnity payment demanded by France of 150 million francs (borrowed from European banks) for their loss of property, and the island’s economy never quite recovered. Haiti was also isolated by an international community- still trafficking in slavery for 60 years after its successful revolution. The brutal U.S. military occupation in the early twentieth century furthered Haiti’s centralization in the capital, weakening regional institutions and economies. Moreover, ruler after ruler chose to concentrate power and develop the capital at the expense of the nation. In that vein, the birth certificates of those not born in the capital, until very recently, were actually labeled “moun andeyo”, people born on the outside. As a result, the escalated internal migration over the years that overpopulated Port-au-Prince was fueled by the search for jobs, education and other opportunities due to the absence of government presence in rural areas. Thus, it is not surprising that rescue efforts and resources are unable to be delivered. Leoganne, Petit Goave, and Jacmel, for example, are still out of reach to rescue workers. Historically, the extractive state has opposed its nation and only served a select few. Recently, I spoke with a friend who was there during the earthquake. He sounded fully present. He politely asked how I was. “You just lived through an earthquake, how are you?” I replied. His words were a staccato of observations: “You can’t imagine how terrible it is… I have taken lots of pictures…videos…this must be documented. Bodies everywhere. The smell. People need to know what is really going on there. A friend of mine has 400 people in her yard. Her house collapsed. Everyone is outside. Some are dead. We need water. Medical assistance. Food. There is no state. No ministry in operation. No communication. Nothing. There is nothing. Haiti, I tell you, will never be the same.” Haiti better not be the same! The earthquake has indiscriminately shifted some of the class boundaries in Haiti, forcing everyone out in the streets due to fear of frequent aftershocks. This disaster, with all of its horror and tragedies, actually represents an opportunity when the time arrives to rebuild a different Haiti — one with a government with a national agenda, not self-interest, one that recognizes its duty to its citizens. Haiti could be a country with industries and labor relations that cease to exploit its workers and stops reinforcing the extreme gap between the rich and the poor. This prospective Haiti could promote expansion of civil space that fosters both acknowledgement of dissent and genuinely supports democratic engagement. This new Haiti can be a place where education is not privatized and centralized in the capital, but available to everyone in all nine departments. And finally, it can be an island that embraces its social and cultural plurality in its myriad forms without debasing its black masses. That simply cannot occur without the constructive will of all Haitians and the international community, especially the United States and global aid agencies, because they have historically undermined local politics. So when rebuilding is underway, we need to remain just as engaged. We are obliged to become vigilant observers and volunteers who question, watch and participate in reconstruction efforts on the ground to make certain that Haiti, which is so close and yet so far away, will never be the same. And must not be the same."
"Campus Jumpstarts Relief Efforts","2010-01-26","by Miriam Leshin, Executive Editor","More than 100 students packed inside of Usdan 108 on Friday for the first meeting of the newly formed Haiti Relief Action Team.  Organizers Sabine Vilsaint ’10, Jonna Humphries ’10, Pedro Ventura ’10, and Rahel Haile ’10 shared their ideas for potential relief efforts on campus, which opened up a discussion on the most effective ways for students to contribute to the cause. Vilsaint, whose parents are from Haiti, began the meeting with a brief history of Haiti, explaining that it was the first independent black republic in the Western Hemisphere. She then gave updates on the current situation after the Jan. 12 earthquake. “A large portion of the island is devastated right now, not just the capital [Port-Au-Prince],” Vilsaint said at the meeting. “Students at Wesleyan have been affected. People have friends and family there.” The conversation then shifted to ways the Wesleyan community can contribute. Humphries identified three challenges now facing Haiti: taking care of survivors, cleaning up destruction, and rebuilding.  The organizers outlined four potential fundraising events. Vilsaint announced a formal event for Feb. 6 in Beckham Hall, for which ticket sales will go to a to-work in Haiti.  Vilsaint explained that Connecticut has the fifth largest Haitian population in America, so the event will be a celebration of Haitian culture with Haitian food and music. “I think it will be fun to introduce people to Haitian culture and also to raise money,” she said in an interview with The Argus. “But I also want to educate people about Haiti.” WesQuisqueya,Ujamaa, Eclectic, X-House, La Casa, and ResLife plan to co-sponsor the event, but Vilsaint noted that they may need other student groups to donate money in order to pay for security. Although planning for the formal is already in the works, Humphries threw out three other possible fundraisers for the semester as well.  She explained that the organizers are working with the Concert Committee to put together one or more concerts that would donate money from ticket sales to Habitat for Humanity or to Care. “The concerts are a great way of helping people who want to do something to contribute to the cause,” Humphries said at the meeting. Humphries also proposed a potential blanket and apparel drive.  Later in the semester, the organizers hope to do a dinner and discussion with Wesleyan professors who are experts on Haiti, for which students would pay a small price that would go to the cause. Ideally a restaurant in Middletown would donate the food, but details are not clear yet. Humphries hopes these events will engage as many members of the community as possible and raise money as well as awareness. “We are trying to find the most substantive way for the Wesleyan community to respond to this crisis,” Humphries said in an interview after the meeting.  “We want to figure out which events will best serve the cause and respond to the need in a way that engages our community as a whole and really helps the individuals that need it.” After detailing the potential events, the organizers opened up the meeting for discussion.  Students from several organizations shared fundraising techniques that have worked for their groups in the past, such as setting up a donation box in a central place on campus.  A student from WESTAND suggested doing “change for change,” in which group members go door-to-door collecting students’ spare change and then take it to Coinstar to be exchanged for cash to donate to the cause. Ventura suggested a potential collaboration with Bon Appétit, in which students would be able to donate meals and points to a group doing work on the ground. Reverend Joan Burnett announced that the gospel concert that was already planned for Feb.12 would potentially partner with the Red Cross. Elijah Meadow ’13, whose parents work in Haiti, suggested a potential spring break trip to Haiti.  Although Meadow expressed concern about the effectiveness of such a trip right now, he felt that students could perhaps play a role in more long-term rebuilding efforts in March. “If people are inexperienced and go now, they are just going to be consuming more resources than helping,” Meadow said.  “But over spring break, if we organize effectively and possibly get some aid training in the coming months, I believe we could really have an impact on Haiti.” After many students had offered suggestions, Director of Student Activities and Leadership Development Tim Shiner advised that the Haiti Relief Action Team set up a Google doc to discuss various projects.  Given that there is a lot to coordinate, Shiner urged students to work together. “I know at least these three or four or five people have already put in a bunch of time,” he said.  “But we need everyone to help. We need people power. Use your past experiences and expertise. Use each other as resources.” The meeting closed with an opportunity for attendees to sign up to work on potential events. While they were impressed with how many students attended, the organizers worried that student engagement in the cause would waver once Haiti is no longer front-page news. “People are going to forget and it’s going to fade in their memories,” Haile said in an interview after the meeting.  “But the reality is that efforts in Haiti need to be long-term and structural.  Boxes of food and clothing now are great, but we need to continue efforts past January.” If you are interested in working with the Haiti Relief Action Team, please e-mail Humphries at jhumphries@wesleyan.edu."
"New Certificate To Encourge Civic Engagement Among Students","2010-02-12","by Amanda Schwartz, News Editor","From service-learning courses suchas Activism and Outreach Through Theater to tutoring programs at Middletown schools, Wesleyan provides students many opportunities to get involved outside the Ivory Tower. On Jan. 29, however, a joint faculty and staff committee submitted a proposal that would make the University’s commitment to community service official. A new Civic Engagement Certificate (CEC) is currently being reviewed by the Educational Policy Committee (EPC), which consists of two WSA members, six faculty members, and Provost Joseph Bruno. If approved, the certificate will appear on WesMaps, the University’s course catalog, next fall. “This allows students who are involved in different forms of civic engagement at Wesleyan to tie them all together into a coherent program with an academic component,” said Civic Engagement Committee member and Sociology Professor Rob Rosenthal. If approved, the certificate would be available to members of the class of 2013 and subsequent classes. According to the proposal, students will not have to fulfill any requirements before applying to the CEC. The proposed program would have a range of requirements starting with a foundation course geared towards sophomores interested in pursuing the certificate. Tentatively scheduled to be taught by Rosenthal next fall, the course would present civic engagement from a historical perspective and analyze its significance. In addition to the gateway course, students would need to take five other civic engagement courses. The proposal lists courses offered during the 2009-2010 academic year that theoretically could meet that requirement including Conservation of Aquatic Ecosystems, an Earth and Environmental Science course, Physics for Future Presidents, a Physics course, and Sociology of Economic Change: Latin American Responses to Global Capitalism, a course in the Sociology Department. Outside of the classroom, students would need to complete two or more semesters of service work through the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism (OCS), in addition to an internship that could be done either during the academic year or over the summer. “We want students to have some practical experience,” said Civic Engagement Committee Chair and Service Learning Center Director Professor Suzanne O’Connell. In their senior year, students would take a senior seminar capstone course to complete the certificate. The capstone course, which would not be offered until the current freshmen are seniors, would require students to work together on a larger project focusing on civic engagement at Wesleyan. “We want the CEC students to be a cohort,” O’Connell said. “Students that are spending time together, working together, and talking about civic engagement.” President Michael Roth approved the Civic Engagement Committee in the 2007-2008 academic year in order to establish a stronger niche for civic engagement at the University. “The effort to develop a certificate in civic engagement is coming from faculty,” Roth said. “I’m really supportive of it. I’ve been talking about Wesleyan and civic engagement and politically-active students since I returned to Wesleyan and people had been talking about it long before I came.” The committee, composed of Associate Provost Karen Anderson, Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) Director Frank Kuan, Director of Community Service and Volunteering Cathy Lechowicz, Vice President for Diversity and Strategic Partnerships Sonja Mañjon, Government Professor Don Moon, Director of Strategic Initiatives Charles Salas, Career Resource Center Director Michael Sciola, Rosenthal, and O’Connell, began developing a comprehensive program that originally included not only a certificate, but also hiring a new faculty member, funding for student internships, and extensive plans for community work with Long Lane Farm. “We planned a very elaborate, expensive program with multiple parts,  new professors, internships, but then the bottom fell out of the economy,” O’Connell said. “To save on the important components  we pared the CEC down to what we could do with no money. It’s still a fabulous endeavor and that’s the civic engagement proposal that’s gone to the EPC.” If the CEC is approved, a panel consisting of the Director of the Service Learning Center, the Director of Community Service and Volunteerism, the Director of Community Relations, and two other faculty members will administer the certificate. “We’re pretty much ready,” Rosenthal said. “It’s a work in progress, but I think the thing to do is to get it going through this gateway course and the formation of a committee that would be watching how it develops over the next couple years.” In December, Kathlyn Pattillo ’12 attended a meeting to give student input on the proposal. “My feeling is that they haven’t got very much student input,” Pattillo said. “And I voiced that in the meeting. I feel like moving forward they need to get students involved in the committee.” According to both Rosenthal and O’Connell, input from faculty and staff influenced the initial formation of the certificate far more than ideas from students. However, if the proposal is approved, ideas from students will take on a greater role in future development. “Once we figure out how the program goes, students will be involved in working to shape it,” O’Connell said. Regardless, Pattillo said she is pleased that the University is giving service-learning and civic engagement greater priority in academics. “I think it’s really great that the University is placing such an emphasis on service-learning,” Pattillo said. “Tufts has a major emphasis on public service already. I think this is a really positive step in that direction.” While the proposal was organized by staff and faculty, Rosenthal said the motivation came from students. “Just from students themselves, there’s a real desire for putting the whole thing together and thinking through issues: ethical questions, questions of the individual,” Rosenthal added. “These are things that are covered from time to time in different classes. The certificate program will allow [students] to engage [these things] in a body of thought.”"
"Seek Peace and Pursue It","2010-02-23","by Zoe Jick,","To faculty, students, and  all members of the Wesleyan community: At 2 AM last Friday night, as he crossed the street at Brown, my wonderful friend Avi was killed by a drunk driver. Avi was a twenty-one year old freshman; he arrived at Brown this fall after having moved to Israel and served in the Israeli Defense Forces for three years. After he finished his service last summer, we all let out a sigh of relief that he was safe- which makes his dying in Providence all the more painful. Yet despite the gnawing “what ifs” that understandably surface in these situations, I am glad that Avi chose to attend Brown. He arrived at Brown motivated to make tangible changes to the way campuses treat the Israeli/ Palestinian conflict. Avi believed that resolution is only possible through multi-voiced dialogues in which both sides feel represented. He was working with a Palestinian student to create a new course at Brown about conflict narratives. He wanted to unlock the two-side-divide; with an open mind and a lot of passion, he attempted to truly communicate, to truly listen. After only five months at Brown, Avi propelled forward a conversation that often results in a standstill. He was already making waves, and I truly believe he would have followed through on his projects at Brown until he changed the nature of this discourse. As I sat at Avi’s funeral just yesterday, I found my sadness only slightly overwhelming my growing sense of inspiration. My own commitment to Wesleyan’s Israel/Palestinian dialogue has always wavered; even after starting the Pro-Israel Advocacy Group this fall, I quickly shied away from responsibility. The campus’ response to the group – animosity, skepticism, attack – exhausted me. When I told Avi about this just a month ago, he was disappointed, reminding me that this work is never easy, but it’s important. I wanted to do something, to show this campus that I care about peaceful, two-sided dialogue, but didn’t quite have it in me. Yesterday at the funeral, though, I realized that the best way to honor Avi now is by trying to continue what Avi started. I propose a new method of conversation about the Israel/Palestinian conflict at Wesleyan. ALL are invited to participate, no matter what your opinion is on the issue. There will be an open meeting next Wednesday, February 24th at 7:00, in Usdan 110, where all are welcome to share personal stories: Why do you care about Israel/Palestine? Where do you stand on the issue? How have your opinions changed? What would you like to see happen on this campus? We will listen to each other generously and empathically in order to further dialogue, not obstruct it. I believe that in hearing others’ stories, we will better understand how we can improve Wesleyan’s engagement with Israeli/Palestinian activism. By meeting others who care about this issue, we will open the opportunity to form meaningful relationships. By listening to other’s opinions, we will better acquaint ourselves with the nuances of this deeply personal and complicated conflict, allowing for more powerful action and more successful work. This meeting has no political agenda and is not affiliated with any pre-existing groups on campus; it is simply a venue for open conversation unassociated with any one side. I aim to create a space for mutual sharing, because only through working together will we enact any change on our campus. If we can accomplish this here, it will have impact far beyond Wesleyan. As Avi’s father taught him, “an enemy is only someone whose story you haven’t heard yet.” So, Wesleyan, it’s time to listen. (For some of Avi’s words, please look at http://www.standwithus.com/app/iNews/view_n.asp?ID=1218)"

The Hartford Courant Maybe there is hope in the world: local mechanic Craig Comparone, who was about to be laid off, stopped by a convenience store on his way to work last Friday and bought a lottery ticket on a whim.

If the nightclubs on Crown Street are any indication, the answer is belligerent. In addition to stabbings on the dance floor and riots in the street, the owner of Alchemy Nightclub and Club Elevate was recently charged with kicking a patron in the face as several other employees held him down. The recent eruption of violence has led to the proposal of a law that would ban underage patrons from clubs in New Haven. The Yale Daily News"
"Three Years In, Roth Looks Back","2010-05-04","by Jae Aron, Alison Cies, Editors-in-Chief","Argus: Do you think anything has changed about Wesleyan since you took over? President Roth: On the infrastructure side, there’s been a greater focus on economics and fiscal discipline, and there is a much greater emphasis on the long-term economic growth of the institution. There’s been a greater focus on what is distinctive about the Wesleyan educational experience. Over these past few years, I’ve been having conversations with faculty, students, and alumni about not just how strong we are as a school but what is particular about the Wesleyan educational experience that we cherish and want to preserve for future generations. That has allowed us to make some significant changes on the academic side, co-curricular side, and in the way we talk to alumni. Instead of celebrating the success and the strengths of the school, which we try to tease out from our own experiences of Wesleyan, we have been trying to look at what we think is characteristic of the personality of the institution and to strengthen these areas, such as creativity and political engagement. We’re trying to define how liberal arts can be made relevant to culture and society. I think we’ve made some progress as a result of those conversations. Here are a few examples: we’ve created the College of the Environment, we’ve enhanced our ability to do work in the community, and we’ve worked to make diversity not just a slogan but a more meaningful experience for Wesleyan students. We’ve also really worked on the way we do admissions and to try to celebrate what’s “Wesleyan-ish” about the place. A: Throughout your three years as President, you have introduced new ideas, new plans, and new ways of running the University. What are your goals for the future and is there a larger vision driving these changes? PR: We’ve had a series of conversations with student leaders, faculty, students, and alumni about the overarching goals of the Wesleyan 2020 plan. I hope the things I’ve articulated in that document build on the progressive legacy of the Butterfield years. Although we’ve set up the COE and the Center for the Study of Public Life during the year marking the fiftieth anniversary of the College of Letters, the College of Social Studies and the Center for the Humanities, I do think there’s a lot more than can be done. The vision is to champion curricular reform that enlivens the liberal arts while making it relevant to culture, society, and the economy, and promoting access to the institution from diverse quarters. In that regard I’ve emphasized   geographic diversity in addition to racial and ethnic diversity. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what Wesleyan stands for. In our history as a university we have taken stands that are progressive, and we know that because others have followed us. There’s a whole range of places where Wesleyan is an intellectual pioneer. Part of the vision I have for Wesleyan is that we should strive to always be pioneers. This will mean that sometimes we will fall into a trap or make a mistake because we have to take risks. That’s something about Wesleyan students, that they do take risks. Sometimes they fall, but it’s such a compassionate community that when people do fall, someone usually helps them up. A: How does your background as a scholar and former Wesleyan student inform your role as an administrator? PR: I think I come to my position with the perspective of a faculty member. The only administrative position that I’ve held at a college or university is that of president. As a faculty member, I was intensely suspicious of any administrator, and so I think I understand a healthy skepticism about any administration. I have tried to be as transparent as possible about what we do, especially in economic matters. Occasionally, there are serious issues of privacy that make it impossible to be as transparent as one would like to be. But on the whole, I think that faculty should be suspicious of administrators. My scholarly work also influences me, which may be for better or worse. My work is about how people make sense of the past. How you deal with memory, desire, trauma, and emotion. Here I am, back in the place where I went to college, which for me was an extraordinarily transformative experience. The person I was when I got here was very different from the person who graduated, in large part because of the teachers I had and the students I met. So for me coming back here is not just an administrative responsibility, but it’s a deeply emotional and intellectual responsibility because, after all, I work on how people deal with their past. The book I am completing this summer deals with issues of history and memory in French cultural history, as well as in teaching these subjects in the contemporary American university. My scholarly work has always been infused and informed by what I’ve been teaching. I always think of my work in as integrated a way as possible, and I try to keep it that way, even while being a university president. A: The recession has strained the University’s finances and forced the University to re-evaluate many of its plans. What has the recession taught you about running a University? How has the recession affected your priorities as President? PR: The recession has taught me that we must be extremely prudent in our use of resources that should in an institution like ours last forever. I think I began to see that necessity for prudence even before the recession hit, when we postponed the science building, but the recession showed us that we really needed to concentrate on our priorities. We did balance the budget, we did cut a lot of things, but we didn’t cut financial aid. The faculty and staff had a pay freeze and those of us at the top had a pay cut, but we didn’t have to have generalized layoffs. In fact we hired over 20 professors in the middle of the recession because we decided we would not cut corners in the curriculum. These hires will have a big impact on students. We also during this period started the Small Class Initiative and added dozens of small classes being taught by our regular faculty. The economic conditions of the last year have really shown me how important it is to be more disciplined about how we use resources we’re lucky enough to have. We have to save money for emergencies; we have put together reserves for contingencies. I don’t think the student experience has been negatively impacted by the cuts we’ve made, and I really want to make sure that that remains the case.  I joke with the alumni sometimes that when I came back to Wesleyan, I discovered that I am a fiscal conservative. Of all places to make that discovery, Wesleyan? But it’s true; I don’t like to spend money I don’t have. Some people said we should have a freeze on hiring, I said no, that would have meant fewer classes. We can’t afford to have fewer classes. We did receive a $1 million grant to start the small class initiative and we did go out and hire Amy Bloom. She’s a great writer who was teaching at Yale, lives nearby and would love to teach at Wesleyan. Happily, I could find a donor to pay for it. All this is to say that I think there are some really great things you can do in the middle of an economic recession as long as you’re really careful about how you spend money. A: Certainly as students, we find the day-to-day college experience to be quite unpredictable. What have you found to be most surprising in your three years as President? PR: The murder last year was by far the most shocking. The shock of the event itself and then the responsibility of trying to keep the campus as safe as possible while there was still a murderer at large was of course beyond surprising. And the compassion, and cooperation, and solidarity at Wesleyan and people outside of Wesleyan… I can’t say enough how proud I was by their generosity of spirit. So there was the surprise of horror and the surprise at how wonderful people can be. And then there are the surprises of being woken up at 3 a.m. and being asked to protect our students from the Middletown Police Department down on Fountain Avenue. Coming out in the middle of the night, and finding the street filled with drunken students and a TV camera was very surprising. I’ve also been to some just wonderful performances and even performed myself, which I never thought I would do in public. I’ve really enjoyed playing music here, and students have been so kind. Other surprises: The economic conditions at the University were surprising to me, but now we’ve got things in hand. And I was just surprised by how much attention people pay to the president. I didn’t do that when I was a student. It’s really surprising to me that people pay attention if I go the gym or walk Mathilde. I should add that people here have been so friendly most of the time; sometimes parents come up to me and complain about a grade I gave in my class, but that’s very infrequent (HA HA). A: What are you most proud of in your term as President and what would you have done differently? PR: I’m most proud of the leadership team’s response last year to the murder. I think we did our best, and that was the most important thing at that moment. Looking ahead, I’m really proud of how we’ve been able to put the university on a track to build the endowment through fundraising, rather than spend money through fundraising. That is an enormous shift in a difficult economic climate. I love the curriculum initiatives, the College of the Environment and creative writing. I think the heart of the school, you know I’m a nerd at heart, is the curriculum and in the end you reflect your values by what you teach. So strengthening the academic programs is really important to me. What do I wish I had done differently? I opened my mouth about too many things my first year and got myself in unnecessarily hot water. I created distractions by saying something in student life was stupid and The Argus ran with it because I really did say it. I said some things as if I knew the place better than I did. I did go here, but it was a long time ago. I’ve come to realize that I only knew a small part of Wesleyan—my friends, classes—and that was my world, but not all of Wesleyan. So I wish I had been a little more circumspect. I talk a lot, but like Wesleyan students, I’m willing to make mistakes. I don’t have a secret formula, I don’t do everything perfectly, so I try to make sure that I am respectful of others and clear in my reasoning. That’s the best I can do. I’m called upon to make many judgments: from big budget items to individual judicial cases. I don’t pretend to have the magic solution. I look at every case, and really think about it, so as to be as consistent and fair as possible. A: What are your plans for the year ahead? PR: Next year, we will continue to work on the things we’ve started. This will include civic engagement work, the internationalization of the student body, and changes in the curriculum. We will look for opportunities for partnerships with other institutions to extend the reach of the University with partners that make sense for us, whether they’re in China or Chicago. And the other thing we’ll do is we’ll stir the pot again, that is we’ll say, ‘OK, we did the College of the Environment, what’s the next big thing?” I think the curriculum should be constantly offering opportunities for innovation. There are faculty members who would like to see more classes that reach across more of the curriculum. I would also like to see us really build on our strengths. It’s a great university overall, and we attract wonderful students, and there are some places where I think lately we have really shined.  The film department, for example, is a program that is internationally recognized for its excellence as a small, but mighty crew. We can build on that. Our science programs are also internationally recognized. We will also invest in the sciences. We really want to make sure that although they are not getting a new building in the near future, we are investing in the equipment and the facilities so that students and faculty continue to do very high level research. In film, they go off to Hollywood and make movies, and in the sciences we also have stars go off to medical school, research careers and biotechnology firms, and I want to make sure we’re giving them the tools they need to be successful. We’re not giving them a brand new building, but we can invest in the sciences. There are opportunities to give the faculty more tools to expand their horizons and to build on the curriculum in ways that go beyond campus. The Albritton Center opened this year, as did the Shapiro writing center. I’m delighted that that building is now being used so well. And next year the squash courts will be under construction as we build a new home for the Career Resource Center, and the Art History and COL Departments. We may not be able to save MoCon but we can make something beautiful out of the old Squash Court Building. That’s something to celebrate."
"Africa for Africans: Thoughts on Humanitarian Work","2010-09-07","by Kennedy Odede,","I want to talk about Africa as an African. I’ve heard so much about the continent since I was a small child, and now that Africa figures prominently in debates as I pursue my studies in the United States, I feel my perspective is an important asset for understanding these debates, and working towards solutions based on the questions they pose. As you all know, Africa and its people have been used and exploited for centuries. Historians often say that history repeats itself. I agree that this is true when we look at how Africa has been treated for the past 200 years. Foreign interest in Africa started with explorations to discover Africa, which led to centuries of exploitation on a number of levels. Now, there is a new way of exploiting Africa: trips to the continent that grant visitors more opportunities than the locals. The work becomes trendy, something to flaunt to get internships and acclaim stateside. Many privileged young people come with the mentality that they want to “do something” to help change Africa. Many people publish books about Africa, as if they have the fortunate position of articulating the continent from a Western perspective, something the locals don’t have the affluence or time to do. Some people even go so far as to collect money by giving talks about Africa. These people are helping themselves in the name of helping Africa, feeding their own fantasies rather than facing the reality of Africa’s situation.  After publishing their articles, and making more and more money, these foreigners are invited into schools and colleges to give talks. If schools and colleges need someone to talk about Africa, I would encourage them to invite an African to talk about his or her experience in Africa. There is no way someone who visited Africa for less than a month will be able to start giving complex and accurate talks about the country. Furthermore, there is no one Africa, as it is composed of many countries, which in turn house a multitude of cultures. Africans are the best equipped to speak on behalf of Africa, and all of the diverse, culturally rich countries the continent contains. Africa for Africans is what I’d like to advocate for. It is a phrase used by Marcus Garvey, a man who died fighting for the liberty of African people. African problems will never be solved as long as many advantaged young people from the western hemisphere think that they can save the world, starting organizations or volunteering in Africa without a deep engagement or understanding of the communities they seek to improve. Without understanding the complex economic, social, and cultural issues involved, volunteers take advantage of the community, and in turn, the community takes advantage of volunteers for a quick fix, a tiny drop of money. This is not challenging the community to engage, and this is not challenging the volunteers. Money alone does nothing, and volunteering alone does little more. I want to cry when these shortsighted organizers talk about Africa, and how they are going to solve our problems. Some of these volunteers want to help Africa, but they can’t truly affect change through methods that do not involve full community engagement. Others do not really care about Africa at all, and come back to the Western world, get good jobs, and use their African experience for greedy purposes.  The reality is, not a single one of us, especially an outsider, is going to be responsible for solving the deep problems of a country, no matter how much we care about helping Africa. Africans can and must solve their own problems, but only if Africans are given access to partnerships and resources that were taken from them long ago, and are still being taken from them today. Africans also want the same media attention that the rich young westerners enjoy when they come back to their home country. I’m tired of seeing young privileged youth from the top universities given attention while the small people in the heart of Africa who are doing great change on the ground, both on their own and with outside volunteers, are not mentioned. I speak from my own experiences. I worked in Kibera slums for more than ten years. I was used by people from the outside, who didn’t want me to see anything good from Kibera. They wanted to continue glorifying poverty, but they never truly cared. They came with their own ideas of how they could save Kibera and I turned a blind eye to them. I know money cannot solve Kibera’s problems. I know a few organizations working in Kibera and based in America who waste their resources by paying outsiders to come and run their organizations in the slums. They have good networks that help them exploit the people on the ground, people who never read their glossy brochures.  This kind of organization will never help indigenous organizations. In fact, they feel threatened by the indigenous organizations, the people moving mountains without piles of money behind them. The rich western organizations only help by organizing sports tournaments for those in the slums. This perpetuates the idea that slum people are only capable of kicking around a soccer ball, but are incapable and undeserving of a serious education. Instead of spending thousands on “community-building exercises,” like soccer tournaments or discussions, build schools and hospitals that are actually accessible (unlike the ones that pretend to be open to everyone, but secretly raise the prices when the foreign donors get back on their planes). I’m writing from my own pain as a slum boy. We all know education is the only way out, but these organizations denied us education. They don’t want to engage the community, and they don’t want the communities to share their thoughts with them. I know they build hospitals in the slums, but they are all too expensive. When I founded a community organization in Kibera, some existing western organizations refused to cooperate with my organization. Even though many were not willing to work with me, there are a few organizations that believe in partnering with local communities to achieve their goals. For example, AFK exposed my organization internationally. If other organizations can be like that, then a lot can be done in Africa. But many organizations still try to help communities without engaging effectively with them. They craft ideas in the Western world, and pretend that those are Kibera people’s ideas. They pretend that the organization is run by the locals as a way to entice donors, when this is rarely the case! In fact, I’ve seen many organizations using Africans who are less educated as their partners to sing songs and stand as symbols of suffering. These same Africans are denied agency of power in that organization. They are being used in name in order for the organizations to get more grants. Any privileged person who wants to work for the poor must first respect them and treat them as equal partners. And they must know that poor people know their problem better than any outsiders ever will. But these kinds of projects, admirable in sentiment but insensitive in implementation, will not last for long. You can fool the locals for a moment, but you can’t fool them forever, and one day they will stand up for their rights. They will stand with good friends of humanity all over the world who want to spearhead change from the ground level. This is why I founded Shining Hope For Communities with my partner Jessica Posner: to create an organization that rejects the ineffective principles I have described above, and truly works with local communities to arrive at effective, long-lasting solutions. We are both equal partners in the organization, and bring different insights and experiences to our work. I bring my experience living in Kibera for twenty-three years, while Jessica brings her detail oriented, managerial skills. Our projects are also being prepared from the ground, where I grew up, and our goal in America is to find the resources to help implement the projects that the community has decided on. It must be said, though, that our work is not possible without the guidance, advice, and support from our board members and partners, who bring immense aptitude to the organization. My hope is that Shining Hope For Communities will help transform what it means to be a charity organization in a developing nation, and prove that problems in such countries can be more effectively and positively dealt with by constantly working with local communities in true, 50-50 partnerships. However, I know that I am not changing the world. In fact, I would urge people to try and restrain from using that phrase, as no one can change the world. It is too big a place. But I know that all of us, both outside volunteers and locals, can work together to positively impact society one community at a time."
"A Wesleyan Introduction to Middletown’s Historic Past","2010-09-17","by Laura Munsil, Contributing Writer","When students arrived on campus this semester, Middletown residents pulled out all the stops. Signs screaming “Welcome Back, Wes Students!” hung in the windows of local businesses, along with loud banners advertising student discounts and acceptance of Wesleyan’s Middletown Cash system.  Although relations between Wesleyan and Middletown have been tenuous at times, they have shared a rich and complicated history for almost 200 years.  Europeans first settled the area now known as Middlesex County in 1650, and the community that sprung up was named Middletown for its placement between Windsor and the mouth of the Connecticut River. The early government, like most in New England, was harsh, boasting fourteen crimes punishable by death including the “incorrigible stubbornness of children,” according to the City of Middletown website. The colonization of the area took years, largely because of Native American activity led by the infamous chieftain Sowheag. By the time of American independence, however, Middletown was the largest and wealthiest town in Connecticut, partially because of its deepwater harbor. The Industrial Revolution also did wonders for Middletown. According to Deborah Shapiro, member of the Middlesex Historical Society, at least one object was produced in Middletown for each letter of the alphabet. Today, Middletown still deals heavily in manufacturing. Its largest employer is Pratt & Whitney, which mainly makes aircraft engines. Wesleyan University opened in Middletown in 1831.  A group of men, led by Willbur Fisk, had the goal of advancing education and Methodist doctrine in New England.  “Methodists were well-known for education at that time,” Shapiro said. Middletown was already 180 years old in 1831, but it had fallen on hard economic times in the years leading up to Wesleyan’s establishment. It was a town of muddy streets and frame houses and still had a public whipping post.  However, there was much to be said for its beauty. John Quincy Adams, on a presidential visit, called Middletown “the most beautiful of all (the Connecticut towns).”  Charles Dickens is also rumored to have called High Street, a street of luxurious mansions, the most beautiful street in the Americas.  Several other towns in Connecticut contested to house the University, hoping to become successful college towns like New Haven and Hartford. Middletown won out and on September 21, 1831, 48 male students matriculated as the University’s first class. Following Wesleyan’s establishment, Middletown experienced an economic boom. It even boasted a major league baseball team in 1872, when the Middletown Mansfields took the field against other major league teams of the era.  In the years since 1831, Middletown and Wesleyan have worked on creating a closer relationship. While rocky town-gown relations have created conflicts in recent years, students and the Middletown community have been working on bridging the gap.  Wesleyan students volunteer at the Green Street Arts Center and mentor children from the North End, and Middletown residents are invited to cultural and arts events on campus. “On a personal note, I’ve always seen the influence of Wesleyan on Middletown as a positive one,” Shapiro said. Wesleyan students tread daily on legendary ground: the ground of Sowheag, General Mansfield, and countless others. Although the campus may at times feel like a sequestered Wesleyan bubble, it is important to remember the myriad ways Middletown’s heritage has shaped the University, and that going to parties on the most beautiful street in the Americas is a privilege, indeed."
"Phys. Plant Struggles in Union Negotiations","2010-10-02","by Erin Newport, Assistant News Editor","Recent negotiations between the union representing the 49 Physical Plant workers on campus and the University have been causing controversy. On Wednesday, a federal mediator facilitated contract negotiations between University administrators and the Office and Professional Employees International Union (OPEIU) Local 153, a branch of the AFL-CIO. According to union representatives, the negotiations have been ongoing since the last week of June before their three-year contract expired on June 30. “We’ve come quite a way at the table even though we don’t hear that [from the other side],” said Chief Steward of Local 153 Pete McGurgan. “The attitude is that we’re being stubborn.” Although administrators declined to comment on the specifics of the negotiations, Vice President of Finance John Meerts shared his general impressions of Wednesday’s meeting in a written statement to The Argus. “The union and the University met Wednesday and had a very productive negotiating session facilitated by the federal mediator,” he wrote. “We want to continue this positive momentum and appreciate the union’s continued constructive engagement.” McGurgan said that he and other union leaders believe that the three primary issues at stake in the negotiations are wage increases, the future of a tuition benefits for employee dependants and the installation of GPS tracking devices in Walkie Talkies and vehicles. According to McGurgan, the University is currently offering a zero percent wage increase for Physical Plant workers in 2010, a 1.5 percent increase in 2011, and a two percent increase in 2012.  The union is asking for a 3.5 percent wage increase in 2010, three percent in 2011, and three percent in 2012. McGurgan said that the administration has raised their offer for 2012 wages by five percent since the beginning of negotiations and the union has lowered their request for 2010 by 1.5 percent. Union representatives cited an increase in health insurance premiums instated in the last contract as a reason for their requested wage increase. Starting in 2007, workers were required to pay 33 percent of the insurance premium rather than the previous 15 percent. Thirty-eight of the 49 Physical Plant workers currently opt into the University health insurance policy. Local 153 Steward and University Painter Kim Krueger said that this increase was especially hard on those at the base of the pay scale, which starts at $36,087 annually. “[The administration] thought that absorbing that increase in [the cost of] medical benefits was something that was relatively easy to do with the wage package that they offered last time, and in reality it was something that didn’t work,” Krueger said. “There are some people that are really hurting from that.” McGurgan and Krueger said that in addition to the decrease in their earnings resulting from the raised insurance cost, they have been given fewer opportunities to work overtime hours. They blame this on what they see as an increasing reliance on outside contractors rather than in-house maintenance staff. Director of Media Relations and Public Relations David Pesci said that he could not confirm this trend. “It’s kind of hard for us to justify where we’re at when we see all of these people walking around doing our jobs,” Krueger said. Data compiled by union representatives from past University phone directories illustrates that the number of Physical Plant union workers has decreased from 86 in 1994 to 49 in 2010. Krueger said that she believes this decrease has been the result of natural attrition and the decision of 11 Physical Plant employees to accept Voluntary Separation Packages during 2009. However, while the number of workers has declined, in 2008 Physical Plant became responsible for the maintenance of what Krueger estimates to be an additional 52 buildings that were formerly contracted out to the firm Rumberger & Company. “We’ve taken on a whole lot of new buildings, more work, and as best we can rag-tag do it with the people left in a 40-hour week,” McGurgan said. Union representatives also expressed concern about the quality of the work performed by many outside contractors. “We find that a large percentage of the things the contractors get involved in, we end up following up, and repairing, or re-doing or revamping,” McGurgan said. In addition to the discussion about wages and overtime, the administration has proposed a clause that would authorize them to cap the tuition benefit for employee dependents at the 2010-2011 rate of $20,907 annually, rather than allowing it to increase in proportion to Wesleyan tuition prices, according to McGurgan. Currently, this benefit provides that the University will contribute a proportion, or up to half of Wesleyan’s current tuition price (excluding room and board) to the tuition cost of any four-year accredited university for the children of Physical Plant workers. “Wesleyan says they’re need-blind for students applying to Wesleyan, but they’re not need-blind for the families that work here,” said McGrugan. “If Wesleyan had implemented this is 1994, that benefit would only be $7,000 today.” Ten employee dependents currently benefit from this program. The representatives said that the third major issue up for debate is the installation of GPS tracking devices in radios and vehicles. According to McGurgan, federal law mandates that the issue be decided in negotiations. He said that, in negotiations, the administration cited the benefit of a GPS system locating workers in case of a medical emergency. However, McGurgan said he worries about other uses for the devices. “We think it’s silly, but we also think that aside from it being silly, we don’t want it to be used in a disciplinary way,” he said. Krueger asserts that despite the challenges of the negotiation process, she remains optimistic about her job at the University. “What it comes down to is our commitment to the community, the students and the faculty and staff,” she said. “That’s the reason that we’re here, that’s the reason we take pride in our jobs.”"
"10/10/10 in Middletown: Students Hit Streets to Fight Climate Change","2010-10-13","by Sydney Lewis, Contributing Writer","On Sunday, 12 student volunteers celebrated “10/10/10,” the climate work party that took place across the globe, by going door-to-door in Middletown neighborhoods to provide information about subsidized weatherization programs available to Connecticut residents. The event, held on Oct. 10, 2010 (hence the title 10/10/10), was hosted by 350.org, an international campaign dedicated to raising awareness and creating solutions for the climate crisis. According to 350.org, the 10/10/10 campaign became one of the biggest days of environmental action in history, with over 7,000 events occurring across 188 countries to address the issue of climate change. Groups around the world planted trees, installed solar panels and stoves, and repaired bicycles, among many other projects. In comparison, the last 350.org event on Oct. 24, 2010 only had 5,000 events. “It was a historic day,” said 10/10/10 participant Dan Fischer ’12. “It was called the most widespread day of civic engagement ever and it was important that Wesleyan students were involved. Events happened in every country in the world except for four.” Wesleyan’s 10/10/10 project was coordinated by Matthew Lichtash ’13 and Evan Weber ’13 through the Wesleyan chapter of Connecticut Students for a Just and Stable Future partnered with The Jonah Center for Earth and Art, a local non-profit organization that works to preserve ecologically significant areas in Middletown. On Sunday, Wesleyan students knocked on an estimated 350 doors of Middletown residents to encourage them to participate in home energy efficiency improvement programs offered by The Jonah Center. “We thought it would be a great program to try to promote in Middletown and would be a good way to spend 10/10/10,” Weber said. The two programs, Home Energy Solutions (HES) and Weatherization Residential Assistance Partnership (WRAP), bring in private contractors to help improve efficiency in Middletown homes. The contractors are hired by the state of Connecticut, which collaborates with The Connecticut Energy Efficiency Fund, The North End Action Team, Connecticut Light and Power, The New England Conservation Services, and The Jonah Center. Technicians will check insulation, wrap pipes, check and seal leaks in doors, windows, and ducts, inspect efficiency of appliances, and install energy-saving compact fluorescent bulbs. These services will save homeowners about $250 annually and improve air quality in Middletown. Although the services can usually cost between $500 and $1600, homeowners are only required to pay a $75 fee to participate in HES. If residents’ income is below a specified amount, they may qualify to participate in WRAP, which is a free program. “I was overjoyed with the few people who showed up [to campaign],” Weber said. “It is very difficult to motivate people to do things outside of themselves. Those who participated commented how nice it was to actually get up and out into the community to help people live better lives and take concrete action towards preserving the state of the planet for future generations.” Of the hundreds of homes the volunteers stopped by, they only gave out forms to about 50—mostly because many people didn’t answer the door. According to Fischer, most people they spoke to were open to the idea. “People were very friendly and definitely receptive,” Fischer said. “We were frankly offering them a pretty good deal. They were happy to know that we were volunteers and out for a good cause and that they would save on their electricity bill as a result.” Some residents, however, were less receptive than others. “One woman actually said that she didn’t want to change the status quo, which is weird,” Lichtash said. “But the majority of people were nice and took the forms.” Another woman who opened the door called the Middletown Police after threatening two volunteers, alleging that they needed a permit to solicit and knock on doors. When a police officer rolled through the neighborhood 10 minutes later, the students only had to show their identification before they were allowed to continue down the block. Not deterred by these few surprising encounters, the students hope to continue the campaign by working to weatherize University professors’ houses. The University has pledged to pay the $75 fee for each professor, so the group is working on getting more professors involved in the program. The group also has plans to expand beyond Middletown. “We’re going to continue outreach on weatherization in addition to working on shutting down the Bridgeport Coal Plant,” Fischer said."
"Affirmative Action Debate Heats Up: Students Respond to Bake Sale","2010-11-09","by Jeremy Keim-Shenk, News Editor","On Friday, students packed the Usdan University Center, rallying from the tops of tables, passing out flyers, and inviting passers-by into their discussion. The demonstration was a response to the Cardinal Conservatives’ anti-affirmative action bake sale that took place earlier last week. For an hour and a half during lunch, students donning the school’s red and black colors gathered in the  center of Usdan. Later that evening, over 100 people packed Usdan Room 108 for a forum about the effect of the bake sale on the Wesleyan community and whether there could have been better ways for the Cardinal Conservatives to express their views. The rally was organized by a group of concerned students in response to the bake sale, where baked goods were priced differently based on the purchaser’s ethnicity. At the event, students passed out fliers regarding myths associated with affirmative action. Several students stood on tables and made statements. “Most of the messages were about how the bake sale had made people uncomfortable and violated their safe spaces, as well as about trying to have unity across campus,” said Nick Petrie ’12, a member of Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitators (WesDEFs). The central location of the rally, like that of the bake sale, encouraged interactions with passersby. According to Petrie, the intent of the rally was more complex than simply presenting an opposing viewpoint to that of the Cardinal Conservatives. “The rally I think was a little confusing to people sometimes because the response is not actually pro-affirmative action,” Petrie said. “The response was more about the way in which the Cardinal Conservatives represented affirmative action through the bake sale, which was misleading, and that they were creating a straw man and then framing the debate to fight that straw man that doesn’t actually exist—partly because affirmative action isn’t practiced as such at Wesleyan and partly because that type of affirmative action [involving racial quotas] is outlawed everywhere now.” The forum was facilitated by Vice President for Institutional Partnerships and Chief Diversity Officer Sonia Mañjon and Dean for Diversity and Student Engagement Renee Johnson-Thornton. Several professors and representatives from the Office of Admissions also attended. Two Cardinal Conservative members, Aileen Yeung ’14, the president of the group, and Tori Rowe ’13, spoke about the group’s reasoning and intentions for holding the satirical bake sale. During the forum, participants challenged the extent to which the Cardinal Conservatives had sufficiently researched the topic before organizing the bake sale, asking why Rowe and Yeung did not meet with Mañjon or representatives from Admissions to discuss the actual policies in place at the University. “I feel like before they did something like that they should have not only spoken to Admissions about what their policies were but also researched the history of affirmative action, what states practice it, how it’s practiced, and who are the biggest benefactors—and it happens to be white women,” said Teju Adisa-Farrar ’13. “And I don’t think they focused on that—they racialized it and I think that was what was inappropriate about it.” During the forum, some students expressed confusion about the interpretation of Wesleyan’s “Affirmative Action/Equal Opportunity Statement,” which applies specifically to hiring faculty, administration, and staff, and suggested clarifying it on the website. Wesleyan has a diversity policy relating to student admissions, but not an affirmative action program for students. Other topics discussed during the forum included the degree to which racial oppression and discrimination are still present in the United States, the methods and problems involved with judging qualifications for college admission, and how socioeconomic and other factors can influence performance on test scores and other standards for measuring merit. Some participants in the discussion, including Assistant Professor of Government Elvin Lim, argued that the bake sale would have been more effective and less offensive if it had taken into account other factors that can affect admissions decisions, such as legacy, athletics, and geographic location. Rowe and Yeung defended their decision to hold the bake sale, and argued that Affirmative Action is a discriminatory practice that hinders the admission of the most qualified students. “I fear that our bake sale and, more importantly, our message have been distorted through the grapevine,” wrote Yeung in an e-mail to The Argus. “During the forum, it was evident that our most vocal critics were neither the ones who stopped by the bake sale to engage us in conversation, nor those who attended the meeting we held the following evening to debrief the bake sale.” Rowe and Yeung responded to questions about the way they initiated the discussion by stating that they had handed out fliers during the bake sale advertising their own forum that they held the following day. However, several students who showed up at this event said that it was actually a Cardinal Conservatives meeting, and that they had been turned away when they tried to attend. “I think they did try [to host their own forum], but since they weren’t really prepared for students to actually come, sit down, and talk with them, it ended up just being a meeting, and that kind of propelled people to not feel comfortable going or speaking,” Adisa-Farrar said. Numerous students expressed satisfaction with how Friday’s forum promoted face-to-face discussion of different viewpoints. “I was really excited to see a lot of people come up, because the goal of this was a discussion and I’m glad to know that that happened,” said Marsha Jean-Charles ’11, who introduced the forum and led the group’s discussion of its goals for the meeting. “I think a lot of us are really happy with the way it turned out.” However, some concern was expressed about the degree to which the forum ended up being an attack against or trial of the two Cardinal Conservative representatives. “I feel like the Cardinal Conservatives felt attacked, even though our intention was not to marginalize them,” Adisa-Farrar said. “There were only a few of them and their responses weren’t as strong as maybe some of the other people who shared during the forum.” The Cardinal Conservative representatives were asked to acknowledge the hurt and disruptions they had caused numerous students. While Rowe and Yeung said that they never intended to offend people, they did not back down from their decision to hold the bake sale. “We’re not going to apologize for what we did,” Rowe said. “We still oppose affirmative action.”"
"In Response to “The Evil Behind Coca-Cola”","2010-11-19","by Steven K. Perrelli,","Dear Editor: I would like to address the issues raised by Natalie Fine, in her editorial, “The Evil Behind Coca-Cola”, (November 10, 2010). Her concerns are important to us and we are committed to an open dialogue with all of our stakeholders including the college/university community about our company and our business practices in the more than 200 countries in which our products are sold. It is important to note that we are local company on a global scale. Local bottlers make and distribute the beverages that you enjoy here in Middletown, Conn, just as the local bottler in Guatemala, Colombia, Turkey, Mexico, etc., makes beverages for the refreshment of local citizens. We do not import or export our beverages. Our local bottler orientation allows us to make a positive impact in each community we serve while still representing a global brand. The Company takes concerns related to workplace practices very seriously. We have been involved in ongoing, constructive engagement with the bottler in Guatemala (INCASA), the International Union Federation (IUF) and other international and local labor unions. There is no truth to the allegations that the Coca-Cola bottler in Guatemala was involved in violence directed at Jose Palacios, Jose Vicente Chavez or their families. The Coca-Cola Company had no knowledge of, or involvement in, these alleged actions. Many of these allegations are stale, and some of them go back as far as 2005. We value the relationship we have with our employees. The success of our business depends on every employee in our global enterprise. We are committed to fostering open and inclusive workplaces that are based on recognized workplace human rights, where all employees are valued and inspired to be the best they can be. Our Work Place Rights Policy and our Supplier Guiding Principles reflect the values of our Company and the standards by which we hold ourselves, our bottlers, employees and suppliers accountable. You may review these policies here: http://www.thecocacolacompany.com/citizenship/work_place_rights_policy.html. The allegations that Coca-Cola bottlers in Colombia have been complicit in violence against union members have been proven to be false time and time again by courts in Colombia and the United States. Two different judicial inquiries in Colombia—one in a Colombian court and one by the Colombian attorney general—found no evidence to support the allegations that bottler management conspired to intimidate or threaten trade unionists. These same allegations were the thrust of a lawsuit filed in 2001 against The Coca-Cola Company in a U.S. District Court in Miami. The Company was dismissed as a defendant in 2003. On Sept. 29, 2006, the court issued a decision to dismiss the two Coca-Cola bottlers in Colombia from all remaining cases as well.  This decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in August 2009. In 2006, The International Labor Organization (ILO), a United Nations governing body for workplace rights, accepted requests made independently by Coca-Cola and the International Union Federation of food and beverage workers to conduct an investigation and evaluation of Coca-Cola bottling operations in Colombia. The ILO completed its independent evaluation in 2009 and issued a report that may be reviewed at: www.ilo.org. The report found that Coca-Cola bottlers are upholding labor standards that have been ratified in Colombia, including respecting collective bargaining agreements and providing a safe working environment. Some individuals and organizations choose to target well-known companies like Coca-Cola because our operations are highly visible, and because our brand name increases the likelihood of attention for their issue and their organization. Even so, we are committed to engaging in dialogues as we look for ways to continuously improve our practices, address the challenges facing us, and build trust with our partners and other stakeholders. Sincerely, Steven K. Perrelli General Manager Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Southeastern New England, Inc. Perelli is the the general manager of the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of Southeastern New England, Inc."
"Editorial: The Future of WSA Campaign Finance","2011-02-01","by ,","Last year’s bid for WSA President was a thrilling race to watch, yet the controversial campaigning tactics employed during the election are, at the very least, a cause for concern. Even looking past the intensely negative campaigns and adversarial attacks that appeared on Wesleying, in our e-mail inboxes, and at the presidential debate, what was extremely problematic was that it highlighted how easily inequalities can arise during campaigning. This imbalance is not an issue confined to the candidates of last year’s election. It is a systemic problem, one that must be addressed by leveling the playing field so that that everyone has an equal opportunity to vie for our attention. The recent call for WSA Campaign Finance Reform begins to address the problem of equal funding, but some other problems still remain. First, campaign spending requires more transparency, so that students can determine an appropriate cap for future candidates. The $200 figure proposed by Democracy Matters was chosen arbitrarily and is not based on past expenditures or actual calculations of necessary costs. Both the winners and losers of past campaigns should be involved in such an inquiry, but so should the student body. Last year, many expressed frustration with the excessiveness of certain campaigns, indicating that some past purchases may not have been necessary to convince students to simply vote. If we are able to consider what campaigns have cost in the past and should cost in the future, perhaps we could lessen the amount of funding we would allot to a student campaign. After all, money spent on T-shirts plastered with a candidates’ name might be better spent in other areas of student life. Second, current WSA members should not exploit their resources to broadcast campaign agenda. All-campus e-mails should be used to update us on campus events and encourage us to vote, not further the agenda of one or two candidates at the expense of others. This, too, is a resource issue—if not every candidate is a WSA member at the time, not every candidate will have access to such a far-reaching mode of communication. Finally, it is important that the election process centers on the WSA’s constituents, not the personalities of various candidates. The negative campaigns of 2010 may have helped to bring about the highest turnout in Wesleyan’s history, but it also caused many to become disillusioned about a process they didn’t care about to begin with. Now that WSA elections have grabbed such attention, candidates should stick to the issues at hand, and refrain from petty attacks on each other’s character. We recognize that the success of past victors is due, in no small part, to their own dedication to winning an election. Several of the tactics employed last year—going door-to-door, talking with students about the issues—not only increased student engagement in the election, but also cost the student body nothing. These tactics are far from out-dated, and in fact seem more reflective of the type of candidate that our student body should endorse—one who is committed to our community and enhancing our college experience, rather than taking money away from expenditures that could enhance both. As we move toward another WSA election, we must take this opportunity to build from the mistakes of past years. Whether or not we go back to the basics of dorm room posters ($25) and heated debates over each candidate’s competence (priceless), we need to ensure a fair system for all."
"Social Entrepreneurship Explodes at Wesleyan","2011-02-25","by Kennedy Odede,","Social enterprise can accelerate social change by focusing on creating social capital. Wesleyan University has played a major role in contributing to social change on issues ranging from divestment in South Africa during the era of apartheid government to being at the forefront of prison education and social justice in America. The Center for Prison Education, for example, has successfully achieved many of its goals through the support of committed students and faculty. There are also teachers, like my mentor Professor Rob Rosenthal, who champion community involvement and change in Middletown. Wesleyan continues to move in the right direction as many current students strive for a world of greater social justice and equality. This trend toward social engagement has led to an explosion of non-profits and social ventures founded by current Wesleyan students. They are determined and ready to work for a better world, whether it’s in Kibera Slums or Mumbai or Bangladesh. We have seen young people like Jane Nestler ’12, Raghu Appasani ’12, Allana Kembabazi ’11, and Tasmiha Khan ’12, who have one thing in common—they are all undergraduate students at Wesleyan and are the leaders of the moment and of tomorrow. They rally students behind them as they share their dreams with the entire campus. Given this surge of involvement and interest in social enterprise on campus, I encourage the Wesleyan administration to start a course on social entrepreneurship to equip students with the skills and on-the-ground expertise that would help those who wish to become involved in social change.  Many of our peer institutions have already started to develop centers dedicated to fostering social entrepreneurship—offering classes, space on campus, networking events, and other resources.  For example, Brown University has started what they call the “Social Innovation Initiative,” and this has yielded encouraging results. Such a course would allow students to take the critical thinking skills that Wesleyan’s liberal arts education teaches, and apply these skills to solving deeply entrenched social issues. This course would also foster collaboration and a support base for emerging social entrepreneurs. I am always grateful for people like Catherine Lechowicz, the Director of Community Service and Volunteerism, who has already provided this support to students and works tirelessly to ensure that the spirit of social entrepreneurship stays alive and kicking. So far, the impact has been tremendous—and there are many possibilities to expand and deepen Wesleyan’s reach. If you take a minute to look at this year’s Dell Social Innovation competition, you might be surprised to see how our own Wesleyan students are blowing away their competitors. Last year the prize went to Wesleyan through Shining Hope for Communities, and this year it might be awarded to Wesleyan again. When I say that Wesleyan is exploding with social change, some people might think I am crazy. But have a look around you—on your way to the dining hall you will see students tabling or selling tickets for events to promote social change. This is an era when young people all over the world are taking a stand. I encourage Wesleyan students and faculty to join hands and offer their expertise to the rest of the community. Many people are surprised that a small school like Wesleyan can be in the top ten in votes in the Dell competition despite the assumed advantage that many larger schools have in the competition. I always tell them, “Wesleyan is a united front where the students are involved in what goes on, and they always want to be part of it.” This is why, though we are a small school, we move mountains. We don’t entertain prejudices at Wesleyan because we are always eager for a better world. Wesleyan is making a huge splash in the world of social entrepreneurship. What else can I say but, “Go Wes!” Odede is a member of the class of 2012."
"“9500 Liberty”","2011-03-01","by Sarah P. Cassel, Class of 2013,","This past weekend I went to the screening of the movie “9500 Liberty,” a documentary about immigration in Prince William County, Va. The movie illustrates how elected officials within the county were pressured by residents to adopt an “Immigrant Resolution,” which allowed police officers to question any individual they had “probable cause” to believe was an illegal immigrant. The resolution ultimately was overturned, but not before Prince William County received national attention for its role in the dramatic immigration debate.  The directors of the documentary, Annabel Park and Eric Byler, were present at the screening, staying late to address questions about the film and political activism in general. During the question-answer session, Annabel spoke about the need to “break down fences” that separate people from engaging in meaningful, knowledge-seeking dialogue. She spoke of the importance of developing political opinions based on substantive facts as opposed to on stories concocted with an agenda in mind. The theory was to reframe discussions so that they are no longer arguments between “us” and “them,” but rather dialectics that are aimed at approaching greater truth. As I listened to Annabel, I thought of Jürgen Habermas’ discursive theory, which promotes civic engagement within society to develop public policy. Habermas’ vision is of active political participation by citizens to generate informed ideas regarding the desired direction of the state. In this view, every individual has equal worth, and thus equal say, in the formation of new societal procedures so that their realization will benefit everyone. The downfall of this theory is twofold: first, that it relies upon eventual consensus, and second, it does not carry enough intrinsic political power to force agreed-upon policies to be implemented. Dialogue is useful for challenging people’s basic assumptions and promoting an atmosphere of learning, but in order for it to have any practical consequences, it must involve legislative power. Therefore, the discursive theory must articulate its objective as attempting to enlist individuals in the rumination of ideas so as to create an informed citizenry that is able to engage in democracy from a politically knowledgeable standpoint.  In order for these civil discussions to be effectively actualized, every individual must come to them with a “Will to Truth”—a sincere desire to gain knowledge and create shared experiences with others that will ultimately inform one’s personal social and political opinions. In Plato’s Apology, in which Socrates defends himself in the Athenian court on charges associated with practicing philosophy, Socrates serves as the apotheosis of a character with the Will to Truth. His entire persona is one of constant questioning with an insatiable desire to learn and understand, though at the same time he is wise in that he recognizes what he does not know and does not claim to know it. The principle illustrated is that we should never be so confident as to believe that, in our pursuit of truth, we actually have it, for our quest merely brings us closer through the constant addition of levels of nuance to the situation. Developing the Will to Truth requires deliberation, commitment, and introspection, and we must be willing to admit that we do not know.  Annabel and Eric’s mission in creating the film “9500 Liberty” was to cast a shadow of doubt on the assumptions held by many residents of Prince William County who equated the presence of illegal immigrants in their community with harmful consequences, such as higher crime rates. While this popular theory had no empirical basis, it was constructed by long-time residents of the county as a façade to hide a deep insecurity caused by the quickly changing culture of the neighborhood. It is important to note that those people did not have malicious intentions—they merely felt that their way of live was being threatened and it demanded protection from the change.  Everyone wants to be heard and to be taken seriously. We all would like for our opinions to matter and for actions to be undertaken in accordance with our values. It is for this reason that a discursive-theory style dialogue, guided by the Will to Truth, is necessary to promote meaningful civic political involvement. Everyone engaging in dialogue must not only participate with a personal desire to gain greater understanding, but also with the recognition that others are doing the same. We need not accept every viewpoint as moral, or even as valid, but it is imperative to see the bit of truth that motivates each opinion so that we may explore the pieces that collectively form a slightly more complete picture of the truth."
"Beta May Rejoin Campus","2011-03-01","by Max Brivic, Assistant News Editor","According to President Michael Roth, the Beta Alumni Association sent him an e-mail on Friday stating that the Beta Theta Pi Fraternity would agree to join University program housing in the fall despite a series of tension surrounding housing in the past weeks. Though the details of the new arrangement have not yet been worked out, the President of the Beta Alumni Association Adam Diamond said that Beta was in close communication with the other on-campus fraternities in order to come to an agreement between the fraternities and the University. “I confirmed to Wesleyan my desire for Beta to join Program Housing for the 2011-2012 academic school year,” Diamond wrote in an e-mail to The Argus. “I also confirmed Beta will be agreeable to signing an agreement with the University if all of the other Greek organizations that own property agree to sign an agreement.” Beta President Jeff Tanenbaum ’12 confirmed that the two parties are in negotiation. “The undergraduates are aware of this letter and look forward to bettering our relationship with the administration to reintegrate ourselves into the Wesleyan community,” he wrote in an e-mail to The Argus. According to Diamond, the University is expected to present an agreement to the fraternities some time this week. A student organized rally was held outside Beckham Hall on Friday as Board of Trustees members walked from the Usdan University Center into Beckham for a Board dinner.  The protesters hoped to see a reversal of the new residency policy, which currently states that beginning fall 2011, Wesleyan students will be prohibited from residing in or using for social activities any houses or property owned by private societies not recognized by the University.  Roth wrote in a blog post last week that the administration would be working with students to revise the stringent language of the policy. Though more than 200 students indicated they were attending the rally on a Facebook event page, only about 50 students showed up, which may have been a result of the freezing weather. Many of the students that attended were Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) representatives. The protesters lined the path between Usdan and Beckham and shouted, “Students have rights!” as the trustees walked by. Director of Public Safety (PSafe) Dave Meyer held open the door of Beckham for the trustees as they walked into the building. One trustee walked into Beckham carrying what looked to be an alcoholic drink, prompting students to heckle Meyer to enforce the new open container policy. One student called Meyer a hypocrite for not reprimanding the trustee. Meyer shrugged off the charge. “Wesleyan has always been an active campus for these types of activities,” Meyer said. “As long as the organizers abide by the policy covering these [activities], then it is just part of the job.” Students also handed trustees a copy of the petition decrying the housing policy, which bore the signatures of over 500 students, as well as a letter written by the organizer of the rally that explained the protesters’ stance. Many students also held up signs with phrases such as “I just really don’t like your attitude MRoth,” “Roth Wes 2020, what about Wesleyan 2011,” “I am not a child,” “Not We$$$” and “Where is the we in Wesleyan?” The organizer of the rally, who wished to remain anonymous said that the trustees meeting provided the perfect opportunity for a rally. “The trustees are a good body to go for, since they have oversight over President Roth, who’s been spearheading this policy,” he said. “It’s been a very top down approach on [the policy].” Board of Trustees Chair Joshua Boger ’73, P’06, P’09 said that he supported the student protesters, but that students should not exaggerate the scope of the issue, which should be focused on Beta. “I’ve got no problem with people protesting whatever they want to protest,” he said. “I think it’s one of these issues where I would urge that everybody doesn’t extrapolate from the actual issue. That’s a problematic response and it should be dealt with it on its own merits. It becomes a pretty narrow issue, there aren’t any other cases like it.” He said that the trustees would not get involved in the dispute because it is not a fundamental Board issue, but he hoped that both sides would come to an agreement soon. “I’m always in favor of students voicing; it’s a positive, and I can pretty much speak for the Board on that. The Board never minds that,” Boger said. “From what I can see the process is working the way it should, and students have made their voices known and listened to, and I think it’s actually going to resolve itself organically.” Roth said that he appreciated the student activism forraising the issue of the broad language in the policy, and that the administration would work to reword the policy and then present it to student committees. “The language was too general, and we learned that thanks to the student feedback,” Roth said. “We’ll figure out how to say make the policy more narrow. I wish I could say that this was some smart plan, but as I said in my blog post, I made a mistake.” He also said that the attention around the issue had the positive effect of raising visibility around the University’s fraternity system. “It makes it clear that Wesleyan still has fraternities, unlike a lot of our peer institutions,” he said. “There’s bound to be tensions with the administration and fraternities; these things happen, and you work them out.” On Sunday, a WSA meeting was held at the Beta Theta Pi house as a sign of solidarity with the fraternity. Roth was expected to attend the meeting when it was scheduled to be held in its normal venue but decided not to come when the location was changed. “President Roth e-mailed me earlier today [Sunday] to inform me he would not be coming to the meeting,” said WSA President Micah Feiring ’11. “It just didn’t seem appropriate for me to attend a WSA meeting at Beta at this point,” Roth said. At the meeting, many students voiced their frustration towards the University and PSafe, with one Beta member saying that if the policy continued, he would encourage students to not donate to the University in the future. The WSA also passed a resolution stating their official response to the policy. In the resolution, students said that they felt Roth only partially addressed their concerns in his blog post about the lack of student involvement in creating the policy and the sweeping nature of the policy. The resolution calls for the administration to completely repeal the policy. “President Roth gave a mea culpa to two points—that it was broad and there was no student involvement,” said WSA Vice President Ben Firke ’12. “This resolution solidifies our point around the first two topics, but our rights are still being restricted. This resolution states that this is still not okay. They’re demonizing places like Beta.” The organizer of Friday’s rally said that this was the first step in a larger plan for more student demonstrations. “The rally is really the first step in a long line of things we hope to accomplish,” he said. “We’re hoping to bring about a reversal on the policy change, but it goes deeper than that. It’s the administration’s attitude towards the voice of the students and towards student rights. The administration has slowly been flexing its muscles, and we’d like to put at stop to that.” He cited the Tour de Franzia events, the chalking ban, the open container policy, and the administration’s disengagement with the Committee for Investor Responsibility as reasons for a larger demonstration targeting the administration after spring break. “We’ll be reaching out to every student group on campus to mobilize themselves and get a much larger rally after spring break,” he said. Staff Writer Daniel Greenberg and News Editor Pei Xiong Liu contributed reporting to this article."
"Support the CPE Re-Approval","2011-03-01","by Katherine Eyster,","After a successful and inspiring four semesters, the Center for Prison Education pilot program at Cheshire Correctional is up for re-approval. After faculty assessment, the proposed five year expansion plan was approved by the Educational Policy Committee last week; it now faces an all-faculty vote on March 1. Those involved in the program have every reason to be confident and proud. To ensure its passage, I am asking you, the student body, to lend your voice to this critical cause. As outlined in its mission statement, the goal of the CPE is: “To advance Wesleyan’s commitment to civic engagement by offering college courses to incarcerated individuals, in order both to enrich the lives of those who are systematically denied access to educational opportunities and to enhance Wesleyan’s academic community.” For the past two years, the most meaningful work that I have done has been within prison walls. As a workshop leader and tutor, I have found community, inspiration, and insight among a peer group that I otherwise would have never known. I entered Wesleyan eager to push my boundaries and challenge my assumptions, but looking back over my four years at this University, I never could have imagined the remarkable outcome of this pursuit. The Wesleyan students at Cheshire prove daily their commitment to the program and to their education. They are committed to protecting and promoting the group before their own interests. When decisions are being made, they never hesitate to consider how these decisions might affect other Wesleyan students and future inmates who might seek to enroll in Wesleyan’s Center for Prison Education. They are curious, they are respectful, and they are committed. Their enthusiasm is inspiring. They have found an immensely positive focus on talent, compassion and teamwork that might otherwise be wasted or lost altogether.  I share this to affirm that what is being accomplished encompasses, yet goes far beyond service learning and civic engagement. This program, quite simply, is changing lives. The five-year proposal includes enrolling new cohorts at Cheshire and expanding to York Correctional, the women’s facility, in 2012.  The inmates, once admitted, enroll in two courses a semester, taught by Wesleyan faculty who receive a stipend for their work. All of the money to run the program is raised privately and does not come from the University. Students are involved in the program as writing tutors and teaching assistants. Students also volunteer at three correctional facilities as workshop leaders, college prep tutors, and classroom assistants. You can find out more at: www.wesleyan.edu/cpe. It is an exceptional program, one that students founded, and one that students, alumni, professors, and the students at Cheshire are committed to seeing through. If you care, let your professors know: send them an email, stop by their office hours, write them a letter, or catch them after class. This is one of few student initiatives to become part of the structure, and indeed mission, of the University. Help us make sure that the momentous student support is not overlooked or undersold. Encourage your professors to vote in support of the program at the faculty meeting on March 1.    Eyster is a member of the class of 2010 and a Ford Fellow."
"Students, Professors, and Middletown Residents Unite in 5K for Brighter Dawns","2011-04-15","by Kimberly Muellers,","On Saturday, April 16, crowds of high school seniors will be arriving at Wesleyan University, eager to see the college, professors, and classmates with whom they will spend their next four years. Amidst the excitement, many of these accepted students will be lining up, along with current Wesleyan students, faculty, and runners from all across Middlesex County, at the starting line of the 5K for Brighter Dawns. While their peers play Frisbee or sleep into the afternoon, these active students will run 3.1 miles to support the residents of a slum in Khalishpur, Khulna, Bangladesh, many of whom must walk for miles each day to collect water for their families. In the Summer of 2010, Tasmiha Khan, a Wesleyan junior, founded Brighter Dawns to improve health in underprivileged communities in Bangladesh. After spending a summer treating diabetes in a slum in Bangladesh, Khan realized that in order to prevent the high levels of disease that occurred in the area, the residents would first need access to clean water and education on personal hygiene, two essential things that were almost completely absent there. Under Khan’s guidance, Brighter Dawns raises money to provide these necessities. The organization, which began as a student group at Wesleyan and recently became a non-profit, will build 30 latrines and 10 wells in a slum in Khalishpur, and provide 1,000 sanitary kits to households in the area. Additionally, Brighter Dawns will hire three local women as community health officers and will train them to monitor the wells and latrines and to educate the community in sanitary practices. This unique, comprehensive approach will hopefully establish sustainable reductions in disease and improvements in overall quality of life throughout the community. Next weekend, Brighter Dawns will take its vision of community engagement to Middletown, offering Wesleyan students and Middletown residents the much-needed opportunity for social interaction. As these two groups, which coexist within the same area yet have retained an air of separation in the past, join together and run, they will also be supporting another community that neither has met before. “The 5K for Brighter Dawns Event…aims to bring together the greater Middletown community and beyond to help bring clean water to a slum in Bangladesh,” explains Jason Lee, a Wesleyan junior and the Development Director of Brighter Dawns. Symbolizing this cooperation between their communities will be the mayor of Middletown, Sebastian Giuliano, and the president of Wesleyan University, Michael Roth. The mayor will deliver an introduction to the event at 10:30 a.m., and the race itself, attended by President Roth and family, will begin at 10:30 a.m. in Middletown, Conn. Participants of all ages and fitness levels are welcome to walk, jog, or run in the event, and water will be available for all. Prizes will be awarded to the top three finishers. Following the race, Wesleyan’s Interfaith Justice League, the co-sponsor of the 5K for Brighter Dawns, will continue the theme of unity with a Better Together Interfaith Brunch, where 5K participants and the public will be treated to free food and a discussion on the meaning of “interfaith.” The brunch, catered by Brew Baker’s, will begin at 11 a.m. and continue until 1 p.m. in Allbritton 311, 222 Church Street, Middletown, CT. “The 5K event is also…an attempt to bring people of different religious or spiritual traditions to work together for a common cause, in response to a challenge put forth by President Obama earlier in March on inter-religious collaboration,” explains Carmen Yip, a member of Brighter Dawns and organizer of the Interfaith brunch. “Different religious communities in Wesleyan are invited and encouraged to take this opportunity…to continue these dialogues on why we serve our society, and more specifically, the Brighter Dawns water project. The brunch will also be a celebration of the various accomplishments and efforts achieved by the religious communities and the interfaith group this year.” By promoting unity and healthy activity in the local community, Brighter Dawns wishes to give something back to their supporters who, through their generosity, are bringing hope to a community abroad.

"Admin Publicizes Campus Climate Log","2011-04-29","by Daniel Greenberg, Staff Writer","An April 20 all-campus email from Dean of Diversity and Student Engagement Renee Johnson-Thornton reminded students of the little-known Campus Climate Log, a blog which allows members of the Wesleyan community to log or share acts of intolerance and prevention efforts. “Since I’ve been involved with the Campus Climate Log, we have received sprinklings of activity throughout the academic year,” Johnson-Thornton said. “We wanted to increase visibility. Several students have told me that they had encountered some issues and they wanted to know where they could record it. We wanted to let them know that the Campus Climate Log was one of many options they could use.” The administration founded the Campus Climate Log in 2006 in response to an incident involving racist graffiti in a University residence. According to Johnson-Thornton, the log is intended as a medium for community members to share incidents of prejudice and discrimination prevention measures. All members of the University community may submit reports to the Campus Climate Log Committee. The Committee then determines whether the incident should be posted online. “The idea was to let the campus community know in an open and transparent way about the climate on campus,” said Dean of the Class of 2012 David Phillips. “Not just for awful, hateful incidents but also for things where we’ve tried to build community and raise awareness, and we’d like to be balanced about that.” Fourteen entries have been posted on the log in the last two years. In the first year that the log was launched, there was a greater volume of posts, with more of them focused on prevention measures. In total, 65 reports were posted during the 2006–2007 academic year, in comparison with just four posted during this academic year. “Its success has been limited based on lack of advertisement,” Johnson-Thornton said. “It’s meant to serve as a barometer to show what the climate is like on campus. And people need to know about its existence and to use it.” According to Johnson-Thornton, despite its relative obscurity on campus, the log has received attention from administrators at other liberal arts colleges. She said that these administrators were impressed with the log’s concept and approached the administrators for more information. Bowdoin College is currently developing their own log, she said. Phillips said that all reports sent to the Committee are thoroughly considered before being posted. Johnson-Thornton chairs the committee, which includes class deans, members of the Office of Student Life, and the director of Public Safety. Johnson-Thornton said she plans to send out an all-campus email at the start of each semester to remind the University community about the log. She is also creating a series of flyers and posters to publicize it. She said that she hopes the increased publicity will encourage more community members to use the log. “We’d like it to be a place where we could record incidents of bias and hate, and certainly where we could promote events that were proactive and educational in nature,” Johnson-Thornton said. “We want to see it become a barometer for what’s going on and we think that if people are putting information there and we use it well then it could become a good resource for us.”"
"Roth on Presidency: Plans for the Year Ahead","2011-05-03","by Alison Cies, Rob Wohl, Executive Editors","If President Michael Roth were a student, he would be graduating in the coming weeks after coming to Wesleyan in 2007. Instead, he has signed a seven-year contract with the University. He is overseeing Wesleyan 2020, and hopes to make progress over the next decade in energizing the distinctive aspects of the Wesleyan curriculum, expanding the public’s recognition of Wesleyan, and strengthening the University’s finances. As has become a year-end tradition at The Argus, we sat down with President Roth to discuss his tenure and his plans for the year ahead.   The Argus: So you recently renewed your contract with the University. What are your plans for the year ahead in terms of academics? Michael Roth: I think next year we should spend a lot of time thinking about the curriculum we have and whether it’s serving our students as well as we would want it to. I have focused since I started on the first year and the last year [in college]. This year the faculty passed a resolution encouraging capstone experiences for all students. We want to see what’s possible in that regard, and then turn our attention to whether the first and second year students are doing what we hope them to be doing. I want to beef up our advising system, and we ‘re going to be running a pilot that will to be experimenting with new ways of doing advising next year. We will continue to try to raise money for financial aid and to support the academic core.   A: What about in terms of infrastructure? Are there any plans to do anything to student housing, for instance? MR: Well I don’t anticipate any major infrastructure changes, but I do expect the old squash courts to be a great new home for the Career Resource Center, the College of Letters, and the Art History Department. Beyond that, we will continue to invest major sums of money in the renovation of our science facilities, in new labs, and improved safety and ventilation systems, and we will continue to do that. On student housing, the biggest challenge is that the most popular student housing we have—the woodframe houses—are also the most energy inefficient, and we are constantly trying to keep them from falling down. We respect the students’ living choices, but if we can replace the most dilapidated houses with the prototypes, like the ones around the [Freeman] Athletic Center, we will continue to do that. But that will be a slow process. I don’t foresee any major building projects, although I do hope we can work with the city of Middletown to improve the corridors between Wesleyan and Main Street.   A: You’ve been called a public intellectual, blogger, and columnist, among other things. How do you think your engagement with your intellectual work and with public and political life affect the way you administer the University? MR: Being a president has had an important impact on my intellectual work and my writing. Part of it is the nature of the job and what I have time for. I did start writing more at Cal Arts, and I did intervene quite often in the public in arts education, because I was a president of an arts college. So at Wesleyan, I’m back home, both in the sense of where I went to school, but also in the kind of education I practice as a teacher, not just what I administer as a president. It’s a much tighter feedback loop between what I do as a teacher, writer, and administrator. I do think it all blends together. That being said, being the president of Wesleyan puts me in a different position in national conversations about education. That is, I have an opportunity to argue for the type of education I believe we exercise at Wesleyan in a national context.   A: What’s the case for institutions like Wesleyan? What should the role of the University be in our public life? MR: The notion that there’s not enough variety in American higher education is nonsense. There’s more variety in American higher education than ever before. It may not be at the highest quality, but there’s enormous variety, from community colleges to certifications to traditional liberal arts colleges. But the call for practicality in higher education is really a call for social conformity, made by people who have every interest in seeing that students graduate without any ability to rock the boat, whether it is the economic boat or the political boat. But I think that the people who make the case are not actually misguided, they’re just disingenuous. Education has served the American economy and culture well when it is a broad encourages the capacity for innovation. Training for well-defined vocations that you have been slotted to enter in advance is antithetical to democracy and to the contemporary economy. So I do feel these attacks on education in the name of economic practicality are [on par] with the attacks on other forms of progressive economic thought aimed at creating a culture of conformity among workers and bureaucrats.   A: So I’m aware that you’ve been meeting with student leaders to get a sense of the different communities on campus. My sense was that the idea is to improve mental health services. Is that the larger vision driving these discussions? MR: I’ve been trying to have conversations with students about how they support each other and how that plays out on campus. I haven’t noticed significant differences among groups I’ve met with—many themes carry over. Part of it is listening to and hearing what students were saying. Mental health plays a role in this. There are students who depend on professional health to get through their daily lives, and those students are here in part because they’ve successfully gotten to this point with professional health in high school. We want to make sure the Office of Behavioral Health is supportive of those who are used to advocating for themselves, but also to help those students who develop mental health issues between the ages of 18 and 22, who need help to get help, who need to communicate to second group that it’s a good thing to get the help you need. It’s about creating a community in which friends can tell one another, you need help, or let me help you get help. Sometimes the best friend you’ll have is someone who says not just ‘you need to talk to someone,’ but ‘I’m going to sit with you.’ Friends should help us advocate for ourselves when we need to. We want to encourage students to exercise their compassion in productive ways.   A: We know that increasing the visibility of Wesleyan around the world is a major component of Wesleyan 2020. What exactly to build the brand, as it were? MR: There are three or four main vehicles we can use. One is recruiting and trying to find the best students, whether they’re in Houston or in Shanghai. Another is making sure that the achievements of our faculty and students are given as much prominence in the media as possible, and [Director of Media Relations] David Pesci has done a great job of getting the work of our folks featured in various media outlets all over the world. Every day I get a report when one of our students or faculty or alums gets mentioned in a newspaper or TV or radio station, anywhere in the country. We track that very carefully and try to build that as much as we can over time. We’re not singing the praises of the University, but by association we build the identity of the University because the work of its students, its faculty, its alumni, is being celebrated. Texas is a good example. We’ve made an effort to get in media outlets there and recruit students there, and be on the minds of people who think about higher education. I meet with newspaper editors from around the country. I try to get my own writing about education out in front of as many people as possible. These are all pieces of it. The most intense coverage we got in the last year was for the Wesleyan Media Project, which tracked campaign advertising. And that was just great work that involved students and faculty, especially [Assistant Professor of Government] Erika Fowler, and it got enormous attention. So over time this builds the sense that Wesleyan is doing big things, whether in Ethnomusicology or Government or Neuroscience.   A: What advice do you have for soon-to-be graduates? MR: I do think it’s a very difficult environment out there for new graduates. And those words have been spoken millions of times in many different contexts. I do think that the transition out of Wesleyan is much more difficult than the transition into Wesleyan for most people because of the intensely positive experiences most people seem to have on campus. My advice is to use your Wesleyan network. Remember your Wesleyan friends and stay involved with them. Because one of the great things about going to a school like this is when you leave, you’re still a part of it. That can be very practical—someone can give you advice about jobs or about internships—and it can also continue your education. You start hearing about people who are doing all of these interesting things who, like you, were scared to death at the end of their senior year and were not sure what to do. And now they are doing all of these wonderful things. So maintaining your Wesleyan identity even after you leave Wesleyan would be my advice."
"Students Rally in Middletown, New Haven, For Climate Awareness","2011-09-26","by Nate Brown, Assistant News Editor","Wesleyan students gather for 350.org event in New Haven. (Rachel Rosengard/Contributing Photographer) Students and residents of the greater Middletown area gathered on Main Street on Saturday, Sept. 24 for “Moving Earth Day,” with the goal of raising awareness and enthusiasm for a movement away from fossil fuels. The global event was organized by environmental advocacy group 350.org. Several members of the Environmental Organizer’s Network (EON) spearheaded campus and local activities in collaboration with Middletown residents. On Saturday morning outside the Church of the Holy Trinity on Main Street, members of EON set up a series of booths, each highlighting a different facet of on campus sustainability efforts such as the WILD Wes landscaping project and WesFRESH. Members of EON collaborated with Middletown community leaders, and the event included representation by local businesses and organizations such as the Oddfellows Playhouse, Middletown Art Farm, and Pedal Power Bicycle Shop. EON Coordinator Oliver James ’14, one of the day’s principal organizers, said that he was struck by the conversations he witnessed between Wesleyan students and members of the Middletown community. “[The day] really just reveals the importance of community engagement and extending our conversation and our alliances beyond the University level to the greater Middletown-wide community,” he said. “[From the] people that came up to us, we would get into these amazing conversations about a resource that they could provide to us or some reason that they were excited about what we were doing on campus or vice versa.”   Francesca Moree jumps hopscotch at Moving Planet Day. (Rachel Rosengard/Contributing Photographer)   EON Outreach Chair Manon LeFevre ’14 said that the event highlighted the sustainability efforts of Middletown residents. In an email to The Argus, she cited one woman she met with two bee hives in her attic that she hopes to donate to Long Lane Farm, and another resident who is planting a roof garden next spring on top of the Community Health Center. “By talking to people that were there, we discovered really valuable resources that we never knew about,” she wrote. “It was really inspiring to see how our environmental projects and efforts on campus can have a much broader reach, and it made us realize that we don’t see much of that on campus. I can safely say it’s definitely something we’re going to get working on.” Following the morning on Main Street, a caravan of students traveled to New Haven for a larger rally organized by the Connecticut branch of 350.org. There, according to James, festivities included addresses from the mayor of New Haven and representatives from local New Haven sustainability initiatives. Participants also spelled out “350” in huge numbers on the New Haven green—the ideal number of carbon dioxide parts per million in the atmosphere for global environmental sustainability. “People all across the world did the same,” he said. “The symbolic action was just really powerful.” According to James, Wesleyan students were one of the largest contingencies of college students at the New Haven event, which drew students from Yale University, Connecticut College, and Fairfield University. After the rally, James said Wesleyan representatives met with representatives from Yale’s environmental sustainability group, the Yale Student Environmental Coalition (YSEC). “That organization sort of took us under their wing and after the event concluded, we were invited to come socialize, network, and throw down with members of YSEC,” he said. “It was a recognition of the potential to just really collaborate on issues and increase dialogue between university campuses in Connecticut with issues pertaining to sustainability and the environment.” EON Coordinator Zach Attas ’13 said that the live stream on the Moving Earth Day website of other celebrations across the globe created an exciting sense of unity. “You’d see a photo from Cairo, Egypt, where there are hundreds of people marching, and they’re all wearing the same thing and holding up signs and getting really excited,” he said. “You’d see people from all the ends of the Earth [rallying] together.”"
"OCS Cuts Work-Study Funding for Two Student Groups","2011-09-29","by Veronica Birdsall, Contributing Writer","David Mai/Contributing Photographer Two student-run community service groups, Let’s Get Ready (LGR) and WesESL (English as a Second Language) have lost their work-study funding from the Office of Community Service (OCS). Work-study students who worked for these two community engagement programs used to have the opportunity to receive pay for their time. This is no longer the case after the programs lost their federal funding. “We reviewed the guidelines over the summer, and the programs do not qualify under the literacy initiative,” wrote Director of Community Service and Volunteerism for the Center for Community Partnerships Cathy Crimmins Lechowicz in an email to The Argus. “These are federal funds and we must follow the guidelines provided to us.” She elaborated that the federal guidelines for literacy initiatives focus on younger students and thus do not include high school or adult students, who are the focus of LGR and WesESL respectively. A handful of groups still meet this requirement, as they focus on expanding literacy among young children. These groups include Ascend, Cross Street, Green Street Arts Center, Traverse Square, WesReads and WesMath, and the Woodrow-Wesleyan Education Program. LGR and WesESL comprise a small portion of the students working for OCS. “Last year, OCS employed about 120 students for literacy initiatives, and Let’s Get Ready and WesESL had 10 students combined getting paid for their work,” Lechowicz said. WesESL, formerly a mix between work-study students and volunteers, is generally composed of fewer than 20 students per year. Despite their smaller size, the program has an ambitious mission, as they work to provide English lessons to University staff as well as foster a community between Wesleyan staff and students. Despite a decline in emails from students searching for a paying job, WesESL appears to be pushing through without work-study funding.  “We haven’t been that horribly affected,” said student coordinator Amy Torres ’12. “Having English-teaching experience is good for your resume and a valuable learning experience.” However, Torres said that the loss of funding is going to change how WesESL and other student groups evolve in the future. “I think it’s changing the way that we look at the program and how we are going to have to start recruiting,” Torres said. LGR provides free SAT prep, college application prep, and guidance two nights a week to local students who are at risk. LGR student co-directors Elana Metsch-Ampel ’12 and Stephen Nangeroni ’12 experienced some initial anxiety after learning of the funding loss. “It was a real resource to be able to combine work study and volunteerism,” Metsch-Ampel said. “We were freaking out in the beginning.” The co-directors are hopeful about the future of their group despite the loss of federal work-study funding. The group has been able to secure a full staff of volunteer tutors. “The fact that they are all there because they want to be there is inspiring,” Metsch-Ampel said. Metsch-Ampel also said that the funding loss changed her opinion of the federal literacy initiative. “There is a certain irony that the literacy initiative wouldn’t cover high school students trying to get into college,” she said."
"A Bipartisan Plea: Vote This November","2011-10-10","by Aileen Yeung, Benjamin Florsheim,","As presidents of the Wesleyan Democrats and the Cardinal Conservatives, we are writing to encourage you to register to vote in the upcoming mayoral election. As we read about the Wesleyan students facing arrest for their participation in Occupy Wall Street, we admire their tenacity and spirit, even where we disagree with aspects of the movement. Activism, especially political activism, is a big part of who we are as individuals and as students at Wesleyan. But at the same time, we have turned a blind eye to political engagement in its most basic form: voting. Last November, only a handful of Wesleyan students voted, and, among those, even fewer did so here in Middletown, where we live for the majority of the time we spend at Wesleyan. Nationwide, less than 22% of eligible 18-to-25-year-olds cast ballots. This November, we challenge our student body to do its part in boosting that figure. In a few weeks (Tuesday, November 8, to be precise), our city will choose a chief executive. Incumbent mayor Sebastian Giuliano (R) is seeking a fourth two-year term and faces a rematch against Common Councilman Dan Drew (D), who lost to Giuliano in 2009, 47%-53%. The margin was 483 votes. A low turnout is expected this year, and the margin will again be razor-thin. This means that Wesleyan has an opportunity to make a significant difference. By getting out and voting, we can not only voice our political viewpoints, but also become engaged in the greater Middletown community. So how do you register? There are a couple ways: By emailing WesleyanVotes@gmail.com, you can get in touch with us and we’ll give you a hand. Otherwise, you can go to www.ct.gov/sots and click on “Elections and Voting,” and then “Voter Registration.” Print out a form, fill it out, and mail it to: Registrar of Voters 245 deKoven Dr. Middletown, CT 06457 You can also go there directly (Google Maps says it’s a 12-minute walk from campus) and fill out a form in person. You can also fill out a form at WesDems meetings on Wednesdays at 7:15 PM in PAC 107. After you register—which you must do by October 21 unless you go in person—you can vote at the Senior Center at 150 William Street. On Tuesday, November 8, anytime between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m., walk a half-block past Broad Street Books towards Main Street on William. Transportation will be provided throughout the day for students as well, and be sure to bring a valid ID. A few minutes of your day is all it takes. If you are hesitant to give up an existing registration in your home state, consider this: especially since 2011 is an off year for elections, the Middletown mayoral election will have more significance to you personally in the coming months and years than any other race in the country. Furthermore, if you intend to vote in your home state in 2012, it’s as easy as filling out a form anytime in the next year to switch your registration back, and depending on your state, you might not even have to do that. By voting in Middletown in 2011, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. We understand Wes’ aversion to institutionalized politics. We empathize with concerns about the two-party system. Disillusionment—often with our own parties—is the daily curse of the politically-engaged college student. But in order for our concerns to be heard, and in order to influence change in a positive way, we must first be willing to take part in the democratic process. The philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote, “[A]s soon as public service ceases to be the principal concern of the citizens… the state is already nearing its ruin.” This November, you, as an individual, and Wesleyan, as a campus, can take a moment to avert our nation’s “ruin” by voting. Okay, so the stakes might not seem that high to you. But you can be a part of a close election that will personally affect you for as long as you are on campus. We will be voting in it, and we hope you will, too. Florsheim is a member of the class of 2014 and President of the Wesleyan Democrats; Yeung is a member of the Class of 2014 and President of the Cardinal Conservatives."
"Discovering Wesleyan’s Spiritual Side: An Exploration of On-Campus Religious Services","2011-10-10","by Michelle Farias, Contributing Writer","There are a few things that a lapsed Catholic walking into a Jewish Shabbat service should probably know, but the most glaring is this: Jewish prayers are not sung in English. When I received this assignment—to visit a variety of religious services on campus—the thought that I wouldn’t be able to understand the prayers never occurred to me. Fortunately, despite the language barrier, it wasn’t hard to get into the spirit of Shabbat. It had a feeling of community, sitting together in a circle—and, of course, there were the drums. “I had never been to a drum Shabbat before,” said Ali Rosenberg ’15, an attendee. “I think [they] really added something, because even people who don’t know the prayers can still engage in the rhythm and spirit behind them.” All around the room, people pounded out the prayer rhythms on drums, bongos, cowbells, tambourines, and even the hardcover backs of the prayer books. A few people led the majority of the prayers, but throughout the room, voices were added to familiar songs, and even I could add in the occasional “Shabbat Shalom!” Shabbat services are a weekly Jewish tradition held at 6:00 p.m. on Fridays at the Bayit. David Teva, the University’s rabbi and Director of the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life declined to be interviewed for this article because he was busy with preparations for last week’s Jewish High Holy Days. Every week at Shabbat is different. Last Shabbat, roughly 40 or 50 students had gathered. At the head of the circle sat three students who directed the prayers and the drumming. It was their week to lead Shabbat, and it was their idea to add instruments. “I like that at Wesleyan different students can lead services and switch it up every week,” Rosenberg said. Two days later, I attended the two Christian services on campus. First, at 2:00 p.m. on Sunday in Memorial Chapel were the Protestant services, also known as the “All-Campus Christian Worship.” Services at the University begin with music by the Chapel Ministry Praise and Worship Team. There were vocalists, violinists, a guitarist, and a pianist all gathered at the front of the room. My modest church back home had a pianist who sang the hymns throughout the mass, but was never showcased as a central part of the service. Worship music groups are common among some Protestant denominations and showcase contemporary worship music. They take the place of the traditional organ and choir. At this past service, eight students took the stage and performed for the 20 or 30 people gathered in the Chapel. “I’ve been to Protestant services before and a lot of them start off with music by a Worship team, so I expected it,” said Iliana Ortega ’15. Apparently, this is a common enough experience; it was, however, once again one that was new to me. There was a very open feel to the service, designed to welcome all of the different Protestant denominations. Pastor Joan Burnett invited participants to clap if they felt like clapping, say “Amen” if they were moved to speech, and sit silently if they preferred to commune in peace. “It’s going to be different from what they were used to at home,” Burnett said. “We do try to make it more contemporary because it’s college.” Service ended with everyone present gathering at the front, holding hands, and singing. Burnett invited us to hug a neighbor. “The Protestant chapel worship service is a place where all can come for inspiration, rejuvenation, prayer, praise and lively, Biblically based worship,” Burnett wrote in an e-mail to the Argus. While not identical to Catholic mass, the Protestant service is the same in that it provides a place for music, reflection, prayer, and worship as a community. Protestant masses include readings, the Bible, and a sermon. They do not, however, include the Eucharist—the body of Christ presented in the form of bread—which is an integral part of a Catholic mass. “I’m actually a Catholic, but the Catholic mass was later at night so I came here with a friend,” Ortega said. “I felt much more welcome here than I did at other Protestant services I’ve attended in the past.” The Catholic Masses take place at 8:00 p.m. on Sundays in the Chapel. It’s comforting for a Catholic, even one who can’t remember the last time she went to Church, to see that there are some things that never change. Catholic Mass on campus was a lot like Catholic Mass at home. The responses didn’t change, the readings were in the same place, and the rituals were still upheld. At this college level, though, mass was more personal. The priest, Father Hal Weidner, makes an effort to reach his audience during his sermons. On Sunday, he connected the year  most freshmen were born—1993—with the movie “Schindler’s List,” which also came out in 1993, using it to make a point about the week’s Gospel. “He knows how to connect with us. He uses a lot of pop culture references; it’s nice,” said Zaida Garcia ’15. Abel Sandoval ’15 added, “He’s very understanding.” When the moment came to bless the bread and wine as the body and blood of Christ, Weidner called everyone to stand in the front of the church to pray. The smaller size of the congregation made this possible. “It’s very intimate,” Garcia said. “At home there are too many people to be able to do that, but here we could all go up and say the prayers together.” The smaller size may have added to the intimacy of the service, but it also means that people aren’t beating down the Chapel door to get a good seat for Mass. There were roughly 20 or 30 people in attendance that evening. At Muslim prayer, likewise, the numbers are not overwhelming. This event is also held weekly at 12:00 p.m. on Fridays in the Muslim prayer room of the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life. “We have around twelve students attend the Friday congregational prayer (Salaatul Jumuah),” Chaplain Marwa Aly wrote in an email. This service, keeping in spirit with the others, has a strong sense of community. Despite not being able to witness the prayer firsthand, I did get a good sense of the service from the chaplain. “Our weekly prayer is filled with inspirational words and reminders to the Muslim students on campus,” Aly said. “A male student leads the prayer by giving a short speech and then leading the Arabic prayer. No one is allowed to speak during the prayer, so it’s solitary in that respect, but during prayer you are foot to foot, shoulder to shoulder with the people standing to the right and left of you. The leader of the prayer makes communal supplications as well.” Ali said that she enjoys when students come to him to clarify their understanding of Islam. She said that she finds Wesleyan students very open to engagement on the topic. “I think there is enthusiasm and curiosity but it’s unnamed,” said Chaplain Aly. “Many people like to think of themselves as spiritual and not religious, but with time I find that the problems they face with organized religion often have to do with actions of the people claiming to practice that religion, as opposed to the actual tenants of the religion.” Buddhist House also holds weekly events. On Mondays and Thursdays, Buddhist House opens its doors for meditation at 6:00 p.m. Buddhist meditation is a means of transforming the mind and using it to explore itself and other phenomena. Meditation is used for relaxation and deep thought even by those outside of the Buddhist religion. “You come in, sit down in a circle, and wait for the person leading to begin,” said Lynx Mitchell ’15, who has gone to Buddhist meditation several times. “They ask how long everyone wants to meditate for and then they ring the singing bowl, which sounds like a bell, and everyone closes their eyes and begins. So far we’ve usually meditated for about twenty minutes at a time. My favorite part is when the time ends and the leader rings the bowl again and everyone opens their eyes really slowly and we just sit in silence for a few minutes.” The final service I attended was Vespers, a comfortable, student-led gathering for students from any or no religious background. Vespers meets on Wednesdays at 5:30p.m. in the Chaplain’s lounge at the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life. According to its page on the ORSL website, Vespers is “a unique Wesleyan tradition for students from any or no religion background to create a different ritual each week that addresses the immediate concerns in our lives and the world.” Vespers is a relaxing place with a peaceful environment. Cushions line the floor, circling a centerpiece of candles and flowers. This week, the student who led the service had us sing in rounds. Round songs are short (otherwise they’d go on forever) and some were familiar, like “Row, Row, Row Your Boat.” This, however, was the only song I knew. Others were learned at camps or were foreign songs. Despite the occasional trouble with song lyrics, I felt relaxed and comfortable. “I like going because there is always something different happening and I can always take something positive away from it,” said Katy Thompson ’15. Every week, the experience changes, but organizers hope that attendees can always take away a sense of peace and a bright flower to decorate their dorm room."
"Despite Registration Confusion, High Student Turnout Expected in Mayoral Election","2011-11-03","by Nate Brown, Assistant News Editor","Though approximately 500 University students are registered to vote in Tuesday’s Middletown mayoral election, campus political groups are scrambling to make sure recent confusion surrounding the accuracy of student addresses does not curb student voter turnout. In the election, Republican incumbent Mayor Sebastian Giuliano is being challenged by Democratic Councilman Dan Drew and Independent candidate Christine Bourne. In recent weeks, the Wesleyan Democrats (WesDems) have gone door-to-door in residence halls in an effort to register students to vote in the election. The deadline for registration has been extended to Monday, Nov. 7 because of the recent power outages. In 2009 Drew lost to Giuliano by 486 votes. According to WesDems presidents Ben Florsheim ’14 and Gabriela De Golia ’13, the narrow margin suggests that Wesleyan students may have some sway in this election’s outcome. “We definitely felt the need to get students to vote so that there would be more of a sense that we as Wesleyan students are residents of Middletown and emphasize that we as a school have a great effect on Middletown and vice versa,” De Golia said. According to Florsheim, once the incumbent mayor’s office became aware of the high number of student voter registration and expressed concern to the registrar, confusion arose surrounding whether registered students need to provide their WesBox address or the address of their residence on campus. “I think that that [the high number of registrations] made them nervous because the perception is that the Wesleyan student body leans to the left and if they vote they’re going to vote Democratic,” Florsheim said. The results of the investigation by the mayor’s office, according to Florsheim, De Golia, and coverage in the Middletown Press and Middletown Patch, revealed that Connecticut state law mandates that because the Wesleyan campus is divided among four voting districts, students must register under their residential address. Additionally, though students have traditionally been able to vote at the Middletown Senior Center, they will now be required to vote at one of four polling stations based on their residential addresses. Paul Gionfriddo ’75, former mayor of Middletown, said that the confusion that has arisen results from the division of the Wesleyan campus between multiple voting districts. “In my view the need for them to use dorm addresses really flows from the manner in which the school has been divided into multiple precincts and could definitely lead to problems where students could move from one dorm to another and could theoretically be erased from the voter list or be accused of doing something that’s improper or illegal,” he said. Florsheim and De Golia said that though the confusion was unfortunate, they hope to move forward in order to maximize student voter turnout. “We went along with what the status quo had been,” Florsheim said. “The registrar’s office was not aware of this state law until now when they were asked to look into it by the Republicans. We’re obviously going to now move forward with that new info and cooperate and try to inform students to the best of our ability that there has been a change. It was unfortunate that it came out the way that it did at the 11th hour.” Florsheim and De Golia said that they are working quickly to spread word of the changes. They encouraged students to look in their mailboxes to confirm their polling station, and that they hope to provide some form of transportation for students who incorrectly show up at the Senior Center to vote. Students who are incorrectly registered under their WesBox will be asked to fill out a transfer of address form when they arrive to vote, but will still be able to vote, Florsheim and De Golia said. “All of this is definitely making it more difficult for Wesleyan students to preserve their constitutional right to vote,” De Golia said. “This is concerning for us who have been working so hard on getting people registered to vote, but it should also concern Wesleyan students so as to make them ask why it’s been so difficult for them to vote and uphold their basic constitutional right.” Giuliano, who appeared on campus Wednesday to speak with students, said that he encourages students to vote, especially those who have taken the time to get involved in the Middletown community. “If a student is basically voting for a party because somebody says ‘Hey, come down and vote for this party’ but they know nothing about [the issues], it’s probably not the most responsible thing to do,” he said. “But I think if you’re going to take the time to get involved in this community, then you have a right to have a say in the direction it goes.” Guiliano said many student voters may even be more equipped to vote than some Middletown residents. “I see Wesleyan students everywhere, and just about anything going on [in Middletown], there are Wesleyan students involved,” he said. “Now I can compare that to some shlub who lays on his couch all day, guzzles beer, and watches COPS and Keeping up with the Kardashians and Jackass and has no clue what’s going on in this community—nobody questions that guy’s right to vote in Middletown. And who looks more like a citizen to you?” Additionally, according to Florsheim and De Golia, Officer Tom Sebold, who works for the Middletown Police Department,  has been spreading information online warning that students who are not official residents of Connecticut may face legal consequences if they register to vote in the state without obtaining a Connecticut driver’s license, registering their cars at their University residences, and listing Middletown as their place of residence on Federal Income Tax Forms if they work during the school year. Calls to Sebold were not returned. However, Florsheim and De Golia, citing the Office of Legislative Research of Connecticut, said that his statements are untrue, and that as college students, student voters are exempt from these regulations. “The way that he is saying it, is being done in a way that could be perceived as intimidating,” De Golia said. “As far as we know, the mayor of Middletown has not made any public statements about his comments, which is also concerning.” Assistant to the Secretary of the State for Election, Legislative, and Intergovernmental Affairs Peggy Reeves confirmed in an email to The Argus that students will not be subject to the penalties of the kind spread by Sebold, but that students do indeed need to provide their residential addresses in order to vote. Florsheim and De Golia also said that while Giuliano was speaking to students in Usdan on Wednesday, students may have gotten the impression from him that they must physically go to the registrar’s office this week to confirm their residential address. They said that students will not have to physically appear this week, but will be able to give verbal confirmation of their residence on Election Day. President Michael Roth said that he was proud of the students who have registered to vote. “I am really pleased that Wesleyan students are getting involved in local politics,” he said. “I met with the mayor and he mentioned that it’s got to be a good thing, and this is a Republican who must feel that a lot of Wesleyan students are likely to register as Democrats. I think Wesleyan students’ engagement can make a positive contribution to everything from the school district to Main Street.” Candidate Drew echoed Giuliano’s sentiments about student registration, saying that he was pleased with the large amount of registered voters. “People have open minds and weigh all the facts, and that’s been my experience with voters,” he said. “I’m sure Wesleyan students will do their due diligence and make the appropriate decision about who should be in office. I think any time that people get engaged in the political process and any time people have a voice in who their leaders are, it’s a healthy thing.”"
"Civic Engagement Certificate Encourages Community Involvement","2011-11-03","by Isabel Rouse, Assistant Features Editor","Spanning a diverse range of majors and disciplines, including chemistry, biology, religion, sociology, government, film, and theater, the new Civic Engagement Certificate (CEC) already boasts 23 fall courses and 19 spring courses cross-listed in the Civic Engagement program. “We’re trying to integrate practical experience of civic activity in volunteer work and internships with academic work, giving students a critical and reflective distance on their practical activities,” said Professor Donald Moon, Ezra and Cecile Zilkha Professor in the College of Social Studies. “Most Wesleyan students participate in some form of civic engagement. The Certificate is designed for students who want to understand the role of engagement in a democracy.” According to the University website, the CEC is much like the more established certificates, in that it enables students to attain a greater degree of curricular coherence than would otherwise be possible. “It provides information about how they could pursue that interest by indicating what courses they should take, and the extracurricular activities such as volunteering that they should consider,” Moon said. The University has long attempted to create an atmosphere that encourages a strong social consciousness and participation in a variety of formal and informal civic activities. According to the University’s website, civic engagement involves activities that allow individuals to strengthen their communities. “These activities include volunteer work, practica, and service-learning courses,” the website states. “This certificate is designed for students interested in reflecting upon and integrating their civic and academic efforts.” Moon believes that the Certificate will help influence the larger University community, even if only a handful of students take explicit advantage of the new opportunity. “We hope to enable students who are committed to civic engagement to pursue a course of study and related activities that would enhance their capacity to engage in civic life in an effective and thoughtful way,” Moon said. “One of Wesleyan’s great strengths is its engagement with the world, and this program is yet another way in which we can fulfill this aspect of our institutional mission.” The Certificate is also closely linked with the Service-Learning course cluster, which integrates experiences outside the classroom with an academic curriculum taught in a classroom setting. “Civic engagement involves bringing attention to the voices of individuals who might otherwise not be heard by the larger society,” said Professor of Theater Ronald Jenkins, who teaches two prison outreach theater classes within the Service-Learning course cluster. The Certificate entails several requirements: a sophomore year foundation course, at least five courses related to civic engagement, a minimum of 40 hours of service work, a practicum, and a senior seminar. One of the best examples of courses offered within the certificate is the prison outreach course THEA205, Prison Outreach Through Theater. The course, which is taught by Professor of Theater Ron Jenkins, brings together students and incarcerated adults to explore and perform texts written by incarcerated individuals. “I became involved in the program through the Service-Learning Program, where I taught courses demonstrating how theater can be experienced as a catalyst for social change,” Jenkins said. “My experience with the transformative power of theater came when I was incarcerated in South Africa while researching performances staged as protests against apartheid. In an absurdly overcrowded cell, I was astonished to see how they defied the injustice of their imprisonment by transforming it into a celebration of resistance to apartheid, performing protest songs, dances and satirical humor.” Civic engagement has long been a focus of the University, so the program is not altogether revolutionary or without foundation. President Roth made social dedication a key strategy in “Wesleyan 2020: A Framework for Planning” through the creation of the Civic Engagement Committee. This committee suggests methods of expanding engagement opportunities, and one of the outgrowths of this committee is the newly founded Certificate. Professor Jenkins sees the implications of this course as reaching far beyond anything exclusive to the University. “Giving voice to this voiceless population is one of the ways that civic engagement can contribute to social change,” Jenkins said. “When Wesleyan students perform the writings of incarcerated individuals with incarcerated individuals, they are expanding the boundaries of civic engagement beyond the confines of the course and contributing to the transformation of attitudes, which is a necessary step towards the transformation of society.”"
"Campaign Finance Reform a Necessity","2011-11-07","by Olivia Horton, Campus Coordinator of Wesleyan Democracy Matters, Argus News Editor, Class of 2014","As this week’s Middletown municipal elections spark debate about voter rights, and Occupy Wall Street protesters across the nation call for limits on corporate power, the need for electoral reform becomes increasingly apparent. Dissatisfied citizens are uniting around a desire for increased political accountability, the removal of big money from politics, and a return to popular sovereignty. The Occupy movement has effectively raised awareness and encouraged support for these demands, but the time has come to focus our efforts and utilize existing organizations and mechanisms to enact change. As President of the Wesleyan Chapter of Democracy Matters, I propose that we channel the energy of the Occupy movement into the pursuit of campaign finance reform. This is a tangible goal that would help solve many of the problems of corruption and inappropriate corporate influence within our political system. Clean and fair elections offer an alternative to the current methods of campaign finance and returns to a government that is by the people and for the people. A system of publicly funded elections would encourage politicians to appeal to average citizens whose political voice might otherwise be drowned out by donations from a rich minority. Rather than allowing officials to seek large campaign donations from extremely wealthy individuals or from large corporations, the reformed system would require politicians to seek broader constituent support. Politicians who demonstrate a certain level of support and agree to operate within such a system would limit donations received from special interests in exchange for additional government funding for their campaign. This allows politicians to truly represent their constituency as a whole, instead of the select few who can afford to fund their election. Once in office, representatives will not be obligated to cater to special interests or corporations that have the ability to offer significant campaign donations. Electoral reform would loosen the grip that corporations currently have on public officials due to the regrettable importance of money in campaigns. Politicians could truly hold corporations accountable for their actions without the fear of losing their means of re-election. The demands of the average citizen would hold actual political weight, and it would be in the interest of representatives to pay attention to these demands, regardless of the size of the citizen’s wallet. The removal of big money from politics increases the influence of citizens and represents a return to popular sovereignty. Our current system is tainted by the corrupt influence of corporations who are immune from political consequences because public officials are dependent on their campaign donations. If citizens want to exercise a true voice in elections and policy making, they first need to destroy this roadblock to democracy. The recent efforts to fight for the right of Wesleyan students to vote in Middletown represents a commitment to political accountability and a desire to have an impact on local governance. These aspirations would be aided by campaign finance reform, which allows true equality in the voting process regardless of individual wealth. If the wealthy few continue to be allowed a disproportionate amount of influence within the government, then voter registration drives and other forms of civic engagement may ultimately be irrelevant in our political reality. Important steps have been taken in the past few months to further political engagement and raise awareness about wealth inequality and corporate influence. However, in order for real shifts in power to occur, changes must be made within the political system with regards to how we elect our officials. Representatives must truly be made accountable to the people through the public financing of elections. The passion for change clearly exists among the American people and it is time to progress from a vocalization of this passion to tangible objectives. The goal of a government truly beholden to citizens is well within reach, especially if we utilize the resources of organizations like Democracy Matters to educate others and advocate for reform."

"Professor’s Bookshelf: Professor of Art History Joseph Siry","2012-02-06","by Miranda Katz, Contributing Writer","Professor Joseph Siry is the chair of the Art and Art History Department, as well as a professor of modern architectural history. This semester, he is teaching Architecture of the 20th century. Outside of his role as a professor, he has published several books on modern architecture, including his most recent “Beth Sholom: Frank Lloyd Wright and Modern Religious Architecture.” Professor Siry sat down with The Argus to discuss his colossal collection and the research presented in his new book.   The Argus: So, what’s on your bookshelf? Professor Joseph Siry: Virtually everything on this bookshelf has to do with the history of architecture, almost entirely European and American topics from Greek antiquity to the present. This is a set of books that I’ve put together over 30 or 35 years. I even still have some of my high school textbooks—history, physics.   A: Your department just moved from the Davison Art Center to 41 Wyllys Avenue—were you able to bring all of your books with you? JS: Everything that is of even the remotest utility is now over here. I brought over a lot of student theses. I have my notebooks from my undergraduate and graduate courses, journals that I subscribe to, art bulletins, and the Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians.   A: Which books do you always find yourself returning to? JS: There are so many excellent authors and studies represented on these shelves. It depends on which course I’m teaching and what topic I’m working on. If I’m teaching the general introductory course on European architecture, I’m thinking of a book like “Architecture and Meaning on the Athenian Acropolis” by Robin Francis Rhodes, or William McDonald’s book on the Pantheon. For someone in a very early stage or first course in the field, these are stimulating, and very beautifully written.   In my mind, there are so many authors here who are models, who wrote books that represent just the very best work in the field. Their lucidity, their depth of learning, their level of insight—it’s that set of qualities that you want to emulate in your own work.   A: Do you ever use your own writing in your classes? JS: Oh, yes, sure. I particularly use my writing on Frank Lloyd Wright in my courses on American architecture.   A: You just published a new book on Frank Lloyd Wright. Could you talk about what you address in the text? JS: Basically, it’s a book about the history of his involvement with religious architecture. I published an earlier book on his first major church building, Unity Temple. He was a Unitarian. He had a very broad engagement with comparative study of religion, because that is an emphasis in Unitarian denominational culture.   This [new work] is a book that deals with the history of his development as an architect for worshipping communities, but mainly focuses on his one synagogue, which was designed from 1953 to 1959: the Beth Sholom congregation in Elkins Park, Pa. He had a very close working relationship with the rabbi. They had a rich exchange of ideas about the history of Judaism, its symbolism, and the appropriate architectural space for a modern Jewish community.   The building itself is a wonderful space for worship. It’s a tall, glass-enclosed tetrahedron, with about 1,200 seats with a focus on the arc. The communal self-awareness in the room is very strong, and metaphorically it’s supposed to allude to Mount Sinai—to represent Mount Sinai as the source of the Ten Commandments. This is a very self-consciously modern and American synagogue for the period. It’s not at all traditional.   A: What sort of research did you conduct for this book? JS: Oh, there were a number of sources. The rabbi’s papers and correspondence are partially at the synagogue and partially at the Jewish theological seminary in New York. Frank Lloyd Wright’s drawings and correspondence are at his archives, outside of Scottsdale, Ariz. The other chapters deal with churches in Florida, Kansas City, and Wisconsin. I went to all of those places—and a number of others—where there were records of these institutions, their clerical leaders, and the urban and historical context.   A: You visited all of these sites? How long did that take? JS: This project started in 2003. I started working on the Pfeiffer Chapel at Florida Southern College. I went down there in 2003, and the book came out in December 2011. The work on Beth Sholom started in 2005.   A: What draws you to Frank Lloyd Wright’s work? JS: Well, he is very well known, but the more you study his work, the more exceptional it is. He had an extraordinary mind, particularly in terms of the geometric and structural forms of architecture. These are very unusual spaces in terms of their geometry and construction. There is no other building, so far as I know in the world, that is really like Beth Sholom, and that’s true of a number of his other well-known buildings, such as the Guggenheim Museum. He had this capacity to imagine highly original possibilities for different types of buildings.   A: Do you have a favorite building of Wright’s? JS: I’ve been very involved with Beth Sholom. Unity Temple is another that seems very meaningful. These are worshipping communities, and the strength and continuity of the religious traditions really comes through. It’s partially a question of social history and religious history, and how he’s able to create forms with modern materials that speak to the people who are commissioning and using them.   A: What about Wesleyan’s architecture? Are there any buildings here that you especially admire? JS: I really like Olin library, particularly the original part of the library. I love its material details and its monumental presence in that part of the campus. Over the years, I’ve really also come to admire the Center for the Arts. In fact, I recently wrote a letter to Kevin Roche (the architect of the CFA) telling him how much I like it. He wrote back right away."
"New Committee Hopes to Strengthen Middletown Relations","2012-02-20","by Sarah Sculnick, Staff Writer","This semester, the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) formed the Middletown Relations Committee in order to create a stronger relationship between the WSA and the Middletown community.  The committee was created as a part of the WSA’s Community Outreach Committee (CoCo). Members of CoCo felt that they needed to facilitate a stronger line of communication between the WSA and members of Middletown. CoCo member Maurice Hill ’14 helped to establish the committee. “The committee aims to establish a long-lasting relationship with Middletown schools, citizens, merchants, and service people,” Hill wrote in an email to The Argus. WSA President Zachary Malter ’13 encouraged the creation of the committee to address past inconsistencies with community involvement. For him, the committee is a way to create more permanent engagements with Middletown. “I wanted to solidify something that could be a permanent body where the WSA could be involved with Middletown,” Malter said. Hill also hopes that an official committee would ensure stable and consistent involvement with the Middletown community. “We want to build a long-lasting relationship,” Hill said.  “We want to have something consistent, that the Middletown community can always look forward to.” Malter and the members of CoCo, including Chair Grace Zimmerman ’13, met with the Office of Community Service (OCS) to discuss the development of the Committee and ways that the WSA can strengthen communication between Middletown and Wesleyan. “We had a conversation about what the optimal role for the WSA was to play in Middletown relations,” Malter said.  “[So that we] could define what they should do in that area, and what we could best do to support other efforts in Middletown engagement.” One goal of the Middletown Relations Committee will be to create various projects every year that incorporate the two communities, Middletown and University, including a larger project that would become a permanent annual event. “In the past, the WSA has hosted a Cardinal Night on Main Street, which was an event in which Wesleyan students would go to Middletown and there would be various discounts in stores and restaurants,” Malter said.  “It was a community bonding event on Main Street.” They are considering another Cardinal Night, or a day of service in which different groups could volunteer together. “We are also exploring the idea of a member of the Middletown Relations Committee attending the Middletown Town Hall meetings,” Hill said. One concern that the WSA and OCS isolated in their discussion about the Committee’s objectives was the lack of communication among different community service groups on campus. The WSA hopes that the group can act as a hub for the different groups to coordinate their efforts. “[We are interested in] sharing information between different groups on campus that are already involved in community service, or interested in being involved, so that partnerships can be formed and everyone can be in the loop,” Malter said. The Committee will comprise  WSA and non-WSA members alike.  The goal is to represent an even broader cross-section of the student body, with members who are all committed to strengthening the relationship between the town and campus. “The Middletown Relations Committee will be working with the current student groups, current members of the WSA, and current students of the student body,” Hill wrote. Many students are involved with the Middletown community through various programs on campus, and the WSA hopes to help facilitate these mutually beneficial relationships. Natalie Hunter ’14, who is involved with the Traverse Square Community Center, said she valued her experiences with Middletown residents. “It’s great to be involved with the kids there, and get a chance to build relationships outside of the Wesleyan bubble,” she said.  “I believe that it has helped me to develop a better relationship with community.” Zoe Weitzman ’14 recently began tutoring through the Woodrow Wilson tutoring program. She felt that there was a definite separation between the residents of Middletown and Wesleyan and said she wanted to find a way to become more involved with the community. “I feel like there is this divide, a sort of social and cultural chasm between [Wesleyan] and Middletown,” Weitzman said.  “Tutoring is a great way to bridge that gap through education.” She also believes that a committee would help to improve communication between different groups, and help more people to become involved. “Every tutor group is sort of isolated,” Weitzman added.  “If there was a committee it would be a lot more accessible for new students and people who were interested to get involved with community service.”"
"Professor’s Bookshelf: Elizabeth McAlister","2012-02-23","by Yu Vongkiatkajorn, Staff Writer","Professor Elizabeth McAlister is an Associate Professor of Religion, American Studies, and African-American Studies. Her past engagements have spanned the globe; her experience ranges from Vassar to Esquire, Haiti to Wesleyan. Even her family spans several continents. She (and her dog Ziggy) sat down with The Argus to discuss Vodou, mixed heritage in America, and the continuing turmoil in Haiti. The Argus: So, what are you reading right now? Professor Elizabeth McAlister: I’m reading a series of memoirs written by people of mixed race in contemporary America, like Mary Gordon’s “The Shadow Man” and Gregory Williams’ “Life on the Color Line.” I plan to reread Obama’s “Dreams From My Father” and a book I haven’t read before called “How Did You Get to be Mexican? A White/Brown Man’s Search for Identity” by Kevin Johnson. I’ll read Rebecca Walker’s book—“Black, White and Jewish”—and Jean Giovanetti’s “One Asian Eye.” These are all for the course I’m teaching on mixed identity through memoir. With increasing globalization and the liberalization of personal politics, there are a lot more people with mixed heritage, and it’s only recently that these people could have flexibility in their identity. Historically in the United States, the so-called “one drop rule” has always been in effect—anyone who has any non-white ancestor is classified as non-white, which was a white supremacist policy to maintain Anglo-Saxon dominance. I’m interested in where there can be more choice in identity for people of mixed races and religions. Also, my family is mixed. My husband is an Afro-Haitian man, and our kids are situated at three points in a transnational and racial continuum. Our first daughter was born and raised in Haiti; she still sort of thinks of herself as Haitian. Our second daughter and our son were raised in the U.S. So, reading all these books and teaching the course is partly my attempt to learn how to best raise my own family. I’m also reading the Percy Jackson series with my son. Jackson is mixed human and Greek god; his father is Poseidon. So the writer of this very successful “tween” series is indexing this new reality for a lot of American kids—the idea that they’re half-something, half-something else. So I’m reading that theme even with my kid—it’s the theme of my life right now. A: What are some of the fascinating things you’ve discovered from your reading so far? EM: The first thing is this “mixed race bill of rights,” which says things like, “You have the right to identify however you want; you have the right to identify differently in different situations….” It’s liberating, the fluidity of identity. The second interesting thing was that I didn’t know how little commonality being mixed has. If people are from [different sets] of families, the issues are different. There’s very little of a common denominator. That was a surprise. I was imagining, “Oh, there’s going to be one ‘mixed’ identity—period.” But in fact, different mixes, so to speak, have really different experiences. A: Are you still doing a lot of work on religion and Vodou? EM: I did my first book on a Vodou festival! Right after the Haiti earthquake, in 2010, Pat Robertson said it happened because Haitians had made a pact with the devil. That comment is the tip of the iceberg of my next book project. The question is: How has it come to be that both American and some Haitian evangelicals understand Haiti to have been demonized, and how did the creation of that mythology come about? I’m really examining the neo-evangelical movement as it’s creating itself on the ground at Haiti. A: Do you still go to Haiti a lot? EM: Last summer and the summer before, most recently. I’ve been privileged to get to know a congregation of Pentecostals that have a female pastor at their head who have been living in a refugee camp in Port-au-Prince. I have been watching how they create, as they would say, the body of Christ in the refugee camp in the face of this horrifying situation; how they use their religion to not only survive, but to thrive. One thing that blew my mind was learning that they themselves have missionaries too, who go to the countryside and do mission work in areas that aren’t even affected by the earthquake. That totally blew my mind. So I’m looking at the cycle of missionary activity. A: How is the situation in Haiti now? EM: The situation in Haiti now is abysmal, catastrophic, and just a daily struggle for the majority [of people]. A: It hasn’t come up in the media very much lately. EM: People who do media studies could probably give us a way to think about this; but it seems to be true that multiple media outlets latch onto a story when the story is at its most extreme, sensational, and vivid. And then they leave the story, and rarely revisit it—so that’s what happened to Haiti. There was a little bit of revisiting on the first and second anniversary of the quake, but there seems to be a way in which the American public wants what’s new and what’s extreme. A: Do you think you’ll be working on this project for a while? EM: I’ll be working on it until I finish my book—several articles and hopefully a book. A: Do you still show some of your articles to your students? EM: I do. Almost every class. I can’t tell you how valuable it is to get student feedback. Students have given me everything from editing suggestions to overarching comments, to critiques about contradictions or problems in the work. Since my main audience is a college student audience, it’s incredibly helpful. It gives the Wesleyan student the realization that we faculty do value the students’ intellect and student feedback. A: When did you decide to start doing that? EM: Hmm, that’s actually a good question. Pretty recently—maybe about three years ago. I was really obsessed about an article I was writing and I thought, “Wow, it would be great if the students would read it and tell me if it made sense.” And students have always commented that they liked that reading because they like seeing what professors are actually working on, and how what I work on is related to the course material. A: How did you find yourself interested in religion and Vodou? EM: The short version is: I grew up forty miles north of New York City. In the 1970s, there was a huge influx of Haitian immigrants. My father had been a civil rights movement activist; he got involved with the Haitian community. I started taking drumming lessons from a Haitian who was a priest of the drum, and I was also an anthropology major at Vassar. I quickly realized that drumming was a very complicated tradition that was new to the United States, and I became interested in it even as a sophomore or junior at Vassar. The answer then seemed to be to study it and do research on it. A: Did you immediately go to graduate school? EM: I took two years after Vassar and then I went to Yale for graduate school, and I worked in publishing in New York City. I worked at Esquire Magazine. A: How was that? EM: It was very fun! I worked in the editorial pool, and it was a lot of fun because the editors would get invited to all kinds of literary events, but also all kinds of fashion events and product launches…and when they didn’t want to go, we—the understaff—could go. So I felt as if I was on the scene a lot. I was invited to a lot of fabulous events. But I had always, at the back of my mind, wanted to be an anthropologist, and I saw that publishing was very solitary. It’s a lot of sitting alone and reading manuscripts. I just decided that while I wouldn’t mind that, I wanted to do scholarship even more."
"Middletown Lingerie Store Proves a Good Fit","2012-02-27","by Theodora Messalas, Contributing Writer","This past windy Saturday afternoon, I set out with an Anonymous Correspondent (a female friend who prefers to remain unnamed) to peruse the racks of Main Street’s own Tina’s Fine Lingerie and Swimwear. After spending the past month oscillating between libraries, dining halls, and our residence halls, a fun shopping outing seemed like the perfect solution to the February blues.  And what better way to brighten my day than with a new set of lingerie? We made our way down to Main Street à la Clueless, finally stopping in front of the purple storefront populated by confidently-posed, lingerie-clad mannequins. The styles they model ranged from bra-and-panty sets to racier items like costumes and negligees. We were apprehensive, faced with a quandary that many young women must confront when choosing their intimates: how can one straddle (pun intended) the line between sexy and outlandish? We entered cautiously, but once we got to the racks of chiffon, satin, and lace, we searched them eagerly and our worries were absolved. The small space is intimate but alive with color and fabric, almost as if it were a performer’s closet.  Painted in the same purple jewel tone as the storefront, the store’s interior is divided into two sides, one for lingerie and one for swimsuits, with clothing rising toward the ceiling on both sides. The number of items is exciting, but potentially overwhelming given the layout; my Anonymous Correspondent and I were sure, despite our best efforts to thoroughly canvas the store, that we missed some things. Saleswoman and partial owner Tina Lun approached us as we browsed. Well-coiffed, but clad in a navy hooded sweatshirt, she looked as if she was showing us around her own closet. She proved an indispensable resource for figuring out size, fit, and even style. As my Anonymous Correspondent picked out a fire-engine-red babydoll (which is a sexy, sometimes see-through minidress with a built-in bra) and held it against herself, Ms. Lun quickly spotted that it was the wrong size and pointed her toward the babydoll she would ultimately buy, a black one with pink trim. “I’m very good [at helping customers],” Lun said. “I have to know what you like. There’s a certain taste for it. If you tell me what you want, I’ll be able to get it for you.” Her sharp eye proved not only helpful, but also necessary for sifting through all of the options available in the store. There were costumes (sexy nurse, sexy priest, and an elaborate sexy ’50s waitress costume), floor-length see-through nightgowns, swimsuits, corsets, and chemises with clasps hanging from their hems, presumably to connect to a thigh-high stocking or garter. Equally impressive was a display in the middle of the racks that touted massage oils, lubricants, sex toys, and other items intended to enhance the sexual experience. The store seemed unabashed in its commitment to the pleasure of its patrons. “I like helping people look pretty and walk out smiling because…they’re gonna have some fun later, right?” Lun said. Tina’s Fine Lingerie and Swimwear opened on Feb. 2, 1997, and is in its fifteenth year on Main Street. We learned that many a University student before us has come to the shop in search of some element of fantasy. My Anonymous Correspondent and I would have preferred if more space had been allotted for more simple items, but we both found great and very affordable bras and underwear from among the choices. I ended up buying a striking red bra with black trim and a few other lovely, lacy underpinnings, all for under $40. My Anonymous Correspondent walked out equally satisfied with the black babydoll and a subtly gothic purple bra sheathed in black lace. As we were checking out, Ms. Lun chatted with us about Wesleyan. “A lot of Wesleyan students come in for occasions,” she said. “You guys have a lot of parties. The Halloween party is big—you’re all here. And you guys have other stuff like sex parties.” We countered that lingerie parties are actually more common now, looking pointedly at our wares. She laughed and wrapped our items in pretty blue and gold paper sleeves. In fact, as a thank-you to her University customers, she is offering 10% off any purchase to students who mention this article. We were disappointed by the somewhat limited selection of bras and underwear—the more accessible lingerie items for college students—but we ultimately found Tina’s Fine Lingerie and Swimwear to be a great shopping experience. The store was inviting and bold, and we recommend it highly to Wes students looking to add a bit of flair to their undergarments, and their weekend soirees. Tina’s Fine Lingerie and Swimwear is located at 394 Main Street and online at www.tinasfinelingerie.com."
"Green Party Presidential Candidate Jill Stein Comes to Middletown","2012-03-05","by Lily Baggott, Contributing Writer","Last Thursday, Presidential candidate Jill Stein came to Middletown. The Wesleyan College Greens, a student group dedicated to Green Party politics, arranged for her to give a talk at the First Church of Christ on Court Street. Ross Levin ’15 founded the campus chapter of College Greens this past fall. Since then, the group has brought several speakers to campus, including the Green Party candidate for Sheriff of Philadelphia Cheri Honkala, the Green Party 2004 presidential candidate David Cobb, and most recently Stein. According to Levin, Stein is most likely to become the Green Party’s official presidential candidate, but the Party still faces challenges to getting her name on the ballot. “It’s also the start of a state-wide ballot access drive,” Levin noted. “The Jill Stein event will be the formal launch of the petition drive.” According to Levin, Democrats and Republicans are usually guaranteed placement on the ballot in most states, but third parties are required to obtain signatures to get on the ballot. Because of this, the Green Party must go from state to state gathering support and signatures to get on the ballot. Levin noted that Pennsylvania requires a large number of signatures to get candidates on the ballot and that the number of signatures required varies by state. “[Pennsylvania is] one extreme,” he said. “Connecticut falls kind of in the middle but more toward Pennsylvania than towards the freer states.” This year, the party needs to collect a minimum of 7,500 signatures in Connecticut. According to Levin, they have set a goal of 12,000 signatures. College Greens members plan to go around campus and Middletown, collecting signatures for their ballot access drive. “We’re going to be doing this ballot access drive, [so] I am sure you’ll see us around campus collecting signatures to get Jill Stein on the ballot,” Levin said. “There’s also this state Senate candidate that we’ll be helping. So I think what we’re also going to try to do is use those two campaigns, for a lack of a better word, to build the College Greens as an interminable presence.” He also noted that the goal of College Greens is different from the goals of other political student groups on campus. “If you’re going to compare us to Wesleyan Democrats, our focus is different,” Levin said. “It’s more like raising awareness that the Green Party is a viable option, rather than this kind of ‘helping out the machine’ that the Wesleyan Democrats do.” Although the group will be working with specific political candidates, College Greens member Dan Goldman ’12 and Levin both stressed that the goal of the group is to spread awareness and education about alternative political parties. “Knowing that there is an alternative is a really powerful thing,” Goldman said. Jill Stein ran for governor in Massachusetts in 2002 and 2010 and other state government positions in the past several years. Her talk on Thursday focused on her “Green New Deal,” which addresses global warming and financial crises. Her talk also addressed the Green Party’s views on legalizing marijuana, ending the war, eliminating student debt, and helping the economy. “I think these are issues which a lot of people on this campus would agree with,” College Greens member Jeremy Keim-Shenk ’12 noted. After the talk, she held a question-and-answer session where many students and Middletown residents inquired further about her policies and asked about the controversial third party “spoiling” of the vote. Afterwards, she went around the Usdan University Center and spoke to students. “I would just say that this is your ballpark,” Stein said when asked what her message to students is. “This is your challenge, and this is your opportunity to create the kind of world that you really need. It’s falling apart right now on your shoulders, and this campaign is a chance to create an alternative that really is about you. It’s of, by, and for you and the future.” With about 65 people in attendance, Levin and Keim-Shenk were slightly disappointed with the student turnout. “Overall, I would say I think it was fairly successful,” Keim-Shenk said. “We were maybe hoping for a few more students, but given that it wasn’t on campus and given that it was snowing, it was all right.” Levin also noted that he hopes that this event and the College Greens’ general presence on campus will involve younger people in the Green Party. “One of the reasons I have felt so good about investing so much energy in this event is that it’s a way to promote activism on campus,” Levin said. “My hope is that people will be brought into the fold of civic engagement.” The event was held at the First Church of Christ in Middletown, in part to broaden its scope, according to Levin. “We also wanted to make this more of a Middletown-wide event and Connecticut-wide event, rather than just Wesleyan,” Levin stated. Levin and the College Greens have been working closely with Middletown resident Vittorio (Vic) Lancia, a local Green Party supporter. Lancia has been involved in Green Party efforts in Middletown for about ten years, according to Levin. “I’m hoping this [event] is something to get things cooking in Middletown and to kick off Jill Stein’s campaign and also the energy of the students,” Lancia said. “I’ve been able to connect with the students because there’s nothing going on [in Middletown], so I have got to go where the action is [on campus]. And I really like their idea of bridging the gap between Wesleyan and Middletown.” College Greens plan to continue bringing speakers to campus and Middletown. According to Levin, they hope to eventually bring the Green Party’s 2000 Presidential Candidate Ralph Nader. They will also continue to work on the ballot access drive, and, according to Goldman, possibly sponsor a screening of “An Unreasonable Man,” a documentary about Ralph Nader."
"Prison for George Zimmerman is Not Justice for Trayvon Martin","2012-04-05","by Paul Blasenheim, Class of 2012","Trayvon Martin is the most recent victim in a long line of black men targeted for execution and erasure by institutional and interpersonal violence in the United States, beginning in the time of slavery. Lynchings by white supremacist terrorists in postbellum United States, Jim Crow segregation, the U.S. government’s COINTELPRO war against the black power movement, the rise of the War on Drugs, staggering trends of racial profiling and police brutality, and the emergence of the prison-industrial complex (PIC) all are rooted in a logic of slavery, which continues to disproportionately incarcerate, disenfranchise, silence and murder black men and all people of color today. Trayvon Martin’s murder at the hands of George Zimmerman, a Latino man who clearly internalized the racist systemic attitudes that have enacted these gross historic harms, represents only a continuation of these trends. It is upsetting yet predictable that the justice movement which has arisen to respond to Trayvon’s death, spearheaded by the social justice community, civil rights groups like the NAACP, the Occupy movement, and Trayvon’s parents, is demanding first and foremost the arrest and prosecution—and by extension, the incarceration—of George Zimmerman. This movement relies predominantly on state apparatuses including the police and the judicial system, which have historically enacted the same forms of violence, overtly and covertly, that took Trayvon’s life. There are many problems with the movement’s focus on criminal “justice” solutions to Trayvon’s murder. First, it runs the risk of turning what is a clearly systemic problem of internal, institutional and interpersonal racism into a “bad apple” case. Second, it silently reinforces and legitimates the police, courts and prisons as spaces where real justice can occur, despite a growing body of anti-racist literature indicating these apparatus’ deal only in the business of oppression. Third, a decontextualized and dehistoricized look at rectifying only the legal failures which killed Trayvon would necessarily demand legislative action through grassroots pressure. This means that once violent laws—such as Florida’s “Stand Your Ground” law—are reformed (a process which can take many years), and Zimmerman is behind bars, the movement can claim victory, and the organized resistance on the ground will slowly dissipate until the next Trayvon Martin comes along (which, in this culture of racialized violence, won’t be long). The United States has a racism problem: it always has, it clearly still does, and it is everywhere. The question those of us on the ground must ask ourselves is how much longer will we allow racist oppression to continue. When will we connect the dots between all the sociopolitical institutions complicit in racism and oppression today? From gated communities (like the one in which Trayvon was killed), to drug free school zones, bank’s red-lining impoverished communities, immigration enforcement officers profiling Latin@s, polluting industries poisoning low-income neighborhoods, failing public schools, police surveillance of Arab communities and Muslim organizations, and a War on Drugs that, by definition, can never end, racism rears its ugly head in every nook of society. From the slavery upon which this country was built, to today’s modern slavery, called “prison,” black and brown people in this country have always disproportionately been on the receiving end of systemic violence. If George Zimmerman vigilante cop wannabe—who fashioned his response off of the police’s habit for profiling, and excessive use of force—had not killed Trayvon Martin, a cop would. Or another young, hoodie-wearing person of color assumed to be up to no good would have fallen in Trayvon’s place. To harp on George Zimmerman is a distraction. To demand his prosecution is a band aid to a gaping wound. Instead, we need to look to the social forces which created George Zimmerman, and others like him who have (not yet) taken life. What forms of covert racism were taught to Zimmerman and internalized by him in our school system? What are the effects of drug(war)-related stigma—as Zimmerman commented to police that Trayvon looked “drugged out”—on patterns of violence against youth of color? What is the impact of current gun legislation and the deepset value of capitalistic, rugged “American” individualism at the root of our gun culture? What history of violence or abuse, often associated with patterns of domestic violence, exist in Zimmerman’s past, which cause him to replicate cycles of violence as an adult? Perhaps, in the case of George Zimmerman, none of these are relevant. But violence always has a reason, a trigger, or a history; it never happens in a vacuum, removed of its context. It is the root cause of this violence which must be the focus of any holistic response to the Trayvon Martin tragedy. And one thing of which we can be certain is that, after Zimmerman survives the violence inherent to incarceration and is released, he will be prone to continued violence outside the prison once more. It is time for us to deeply reimagine responses to violence which do not involve the criminal penal system or the police and to respond to cases like Trayvon’s with a systemic critique and holistic vision. Such a vision necessarily includes supporting both Trayvon’s family, and George Zimmerman himself, through the process of healing, towards a future where neither are touched by violence ever again. The police, courts and prisons exist only to maintain the status quo of power and oppression and should be abolished, or in the least disarmed, demilitarized, defunded and reimagined. Community-based justice programs must take the place of cops and police wannabes, to engage those impacted by horrific violence in the process of healing and reparation. Luckily, models for community-based parole boards, community courts and restorative justice programs—all of which represent a tangible alternative to the criminal penal system—exist. Now all we need is a robust, grassroots campaign to turn them into a reality, which is no easy task and cannot be won with a protest or the writing of a letter. I propose we begin this arduous but essential campaign right here in college, cultivating a campus culture of accountability which does not utilize PSafe, the SJB, or the MPD. In the aftermath of the brutal murder of Sean Bell by NYPD officers in 2006, and the subsequent acquittal of the officers on all charges in 2008, Wesleyan students, furious with the culture of racist police brutality, blockaded the stairs in Usdan to express their dissent and imagine a different world without racist institutions (Argus Article: http://wesleyanargus.com/2008/05/06/protesting-profiling-ny-shooting-prompts-marketplace-barricade/). The relative silence on campus regarding the murder of Trayvon Martin, or the recent police murders of Anna Martin, Kenneth Chamberlain, Sr., Nery Romero, Yvonne McNeal, Ramarley Graham, Charles Hill, and Oscar Grant beg the question: where has the organized resistance to institutional racism at Wesleyan gone? Wesleyan, let’s get moving. Our hands are not cleansed of the blood of racial oppression across this country. “Diversity University” is poised to end our need-blind admissions policy within the next decade, which will further self-select students from marginalized communities and low-income backgrounds away from Wesleyan. The campus-wide engagement on this imminent policy change (which one would assume would be organized by our administration, who are supposedly respectful of student concerns, to garner student feedback), is markedly, yet unsurprisingly, absent. Furthermore, stories of racial profiling by PSafe, the Ride, fellow students and even faculty have surfaced over recent years, a stark reminder that racism is alive and well at Wesleyan. Our administration has consistently failed to adequately address the needs of our janitorial staff, who are grossly underpaid and suffer from a lack of access to information pertinent to their lives, and in their native langu ages. The state of Connecticut spends more money on prisons and the larger criminal penal system than it does on education. These trends must end, and in the memory of those who struggled before us, it must continue with us. Let us never forget Trayvon Martin, and let us be true to the memory of all those whose lives have been stolen in our culture of violence. Another world is possible, another justice system is necessary, and another culture could be happening, if we come together and dream it."
"Civic Engagement Fellowship Will Launch In July","2012-04-09","by Lily Baggott, Staff Writer","The Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) has launched a new Civic Engagement Fellowship that will begin in July 2012. The fellowship will be a one-year, paid position for a recent graduate. “Civic engagement and engagement with the world is a priority for the University,” Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Catherine Lechowicz said. “We are very excited to have a recent alum fill this role to help connect all of these different things that are happening on campus.” In an effort to connect all of the civic engagement efforts on campus, the new fellowship will have a broad range of responsibilities, according to Lechowicz. Based at the CCP, the fellow will work with the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism (OCS), Green Street Arts Center, Center for Prison Education (CPE), Service-Learning Center, Allbritton Center for Study of Public Life, and the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. “We want these things to be connected and have synergy,” Lechowicz said. “And so this individual will help both in terms of engaging the students that are going through our office and also building bridges to these other areas. [The fellow will] help students see that, while we have different centers, all of this work is definitely connected.” The fellow will connect local civic action by the CCP and academic study, according to Lechowicz. Additionally, the fellow will work with students, manage social media, and generate online resources, among other duties. “What we imagine is that the CCP is really hands on local work, but really the social entrepreneurship piece is providing training and development of ideas in terms of social ventures,” Lechowicz said. “And then the Allbritton Center is more on the academic side in terms of studying public life and looking at it through an academic lens.” Lechowicz noted that she and other staff members were inspired to create the fellowship after seeing the CPE and writing fellowships in action. “It’s similar to the writing fellowships,” Lechowicz said. “I think the great work that has happened with that program through the engagement of recent alums is a really exciting opportunity.” Lechowicz said she envisioned the position for a recent graduate with the University experience sztill fresh on his or her mind. “We’ve all been talking for a while about the amount of work we’re doing through the CCP with limited staffing and seeing that our students are so engaged when they’re here as undergrads,” Lechowicz said. “And we really see this additional year as an opportunity to capture that energy and excitement while also helping the student gain this professional experience in a context that they know really well.” In addition, the fellow will work closely with the new Civic Engagement Certificate Program. “We just started the Civic Engagement Certificate Program,” Lechowicz said. “This person will help in the launching of that program. So there’s lots of different little things that are happening that I think will be really great to have someone helping us focus on that.” With the advent of the Patricelli Center and the growth of the CCP, Lechowicz and other center directors discussed creating this fellowship during the last few months. “These were ongoing conversations between directors here at the Center for Community Partnerships as these other programs were developed,” Lechowicz said. “This is what we see as a need and as an opportunity for students to have a lot of input, as a recent grad, to develop these programs more.” The hiring committee will consist of Lechowicz, Director of Community Relations Frank Kuan, Director of Service Learning Center Suzanne O’Connell, and Internship and Civic Engagement Coordinator Paul Gagnon. The committee accepted applications through April 10, and Lechowicz expressed excitement over the quality of the applicants. The decision will be made by the end of this month in order to have the fellow in office by July. The fellowship will run for one year, from July to June, and will be a full-time, paid fellowship. According to Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs Rob Rosenthal, the Executive Budget Committee—composed of himself, President Michael Roth, and Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts-—accepted the fellowship proposal and allocated an estimated $28,000 for the position’s salary. Rosenthal said that the proposal will be reviewed again after two years. “It’s a new money proposal, meaning it’s funded from the general budget but is a pilot program only, which will be reviewed after two years,” Rosenthal wrote in an email to The Argus. Lechowicz said that hiring one fellow would be sufficient to meet the growing demands of the centers. “I think we’ll see how this goes,” she said. “Certainly, through the Office of Community Service, we have grown our programs, but I think it can be managed pretty easily with an additional person.”"
"WesFest: Student Run Events You Don’t Want to Miss","2012-04-12","by Isabel Rouse, Features Editor","WeSLAM -What they want you to know: We are a group of students who are passionate about poetry—poetry that exists as much in person, space, and sound as it does on the page. We host poetry events around campus, including competitive slams. These competitive slams form a new slam team every year [that] slams around the region and nation. -What/where/when is your event? WeSLAM is hosting an intercollegiate poetry slam, featuring Wesleyan vs. SUNY Oneonta vs. Yale vs. NYU, 8 p.m. on Saturday night in the Center for the Arts Hall. -What should new students know about your group? Last year, which was Wesleyan’s first year having a slam team, we took 7th place at the College Unions Poetry Slam Invitational (CUPSI), the largest college poetry slam in the nation. We also won the prestigious Spirit of the Slam award. We’re heading back to nationals this Tuesday! -Why should pre-frosh come? Pre-frosh should come see what the Wesleyan slam poetry scene is all about. We have an extremely supportive community of poets on campus that goes far beyond the members of the team. Whether or not you are a poet, you should come; poetry slams are fun to watch. Pre-frosh should expect to participate—a poetry slam is not your average poetry reading. The audience gets loud. Very loud. You are encouraged to cheer, snap, howl, and express how you feel about the poems. We would also love for some pre-frosh to participate as one of the five judges in the slam! -What is special about your event? This will be the first time in WeSLAM’s two years that we will be bringing such a large number of poets to Wesleyan, making it the biggest slam Wesleyan has ever seen. -Why did you want to do this event? A big part of WeSLAM’s mission is to spread the love of the poetry slam to as many people as possible. If you’ve never been to a slam before, you are in for a surprise. What better way to attract new students to Wesleyan than to have people pour out their hearts and souls to an audience of strangers and then have their poems judged for the world to see? The competition is silly, but when the pre-frosh feel the vibe, they will definitely be attracted to Wesleyan. -Any surprises in your event? There will always be that one poem which catches you off-guard and makes you laugh, cry, or think differently. We hope to see you there. It is a guaranteed excellent time. The Wesleyan Ampersand -What they want you to know – The Wesleyan Ampersand is the humor section of The Argus, the school’s newspaper. I don’t know when it was founded. -What/where/when is your event? Our event is blind dating for pre-frosh. It is in the Usdan multi-purpose room. From 5:45-7:30 p.m. on Saturday, April 14. We’re going to pair visiting prospective students with other visiting prospective students in the hope that they can get together and find any common interest they may have, and see if there’s a spark there— something happening, something romantic. They are about to start a new life here, and what better way to start a new section of your life than with a budding romantic interest? That’s what we’re hoping to do for people. -Why should students come to participate? Well, I would say that current students who have pre-frosh should bring them, because often you don’t know quite what to do with them between, say, Zonker Harris Day and the film series—this fits nicely in between the two. So it’s good for hosts, so they can have something to do. And it’s good for visiting students because it’s a great way to meet people. So you can meet a new friend, a new romantic interest. You know, have a good time. That kind of thing. -What is special about your event? I would say there’s probably no one else on campus who’s hosting pre-frosh blind dating on campus. The people who come to this event will be the intrepid souls willing to try something outside of their comfort zone. If you are that type of person, you will find people with that kind of shared interested in pre-frosh blind dating. -Why did your group decide to do an event, and why this event in particular? There’s currently no one doing any pre-frosh blind dating event. We decided to fill that niche. We thought it was a good thing to do. Often you’re a pre-frosh and you’re visiting, and you have these awkward stilted interactions, like ‘where are you from, what are you studying,’ and this awkward hinting at where you got into college. I think it’s an uncomfortable thing to do. We are trying to get around that, having a better time with people. -How do you think your event will attract new students to Wesleyan? Well, if you meet something at this thing that you think you might become romantically involved with, you could both agree to attend Wesleyan, and then work on that. That’s one reason. Maybe also people will have a good time. You know, the main thing is the romantic interest fostering but you could meet some non-romantic friends probably. Which everyone has. Muslim Student Association -What they want you to know: We’re the group for you if you’re interested in Islam, Muslims, or Muslim cultures. We’re super open to people of all backgrounds, levels of religiosity and interests, and we’d love to meet you! -What/where/when is your event? We’re hosting Friday jummah prayer in the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life (169 High) at 1 p.m., followed by ice cream sundaes at Turath House, the Middle Eastern/Muslim program house (22 Lawn) at 2 p.m. -Why should pre-frosh come to participate? College is the perfect time to dive into new interests, and develop parts of yourself you may not have had the chance to before. The MSA gives you a chance to learn about a religion and a culture not everyone is familiar with and offers a great network of people you can talk to about Muslim-ness and all things Islam-y. Friday jummah prayer is just a taste of the kinds of events the MSA has—from social events to film screenings and lectures to personal spiritual study circles—we do lots. Come to Wes and enjoy everything else we have to offer throughout the year! -Any surprises planned for the pre-frosh? A well-kept secret around campus—the MSA events always have the best food. The Wesleyan Democrats (Wesdems) -What they want you to know: We don’t just talk politics. Our efforts are focused on spreading the good word of the Democratic Party and electing Democrat leaders. Last semester we worked very diligently to elect our new mayor, Daniel T. Drew. -What/where/when is your event? Mayor Dan Drew will be giving a speech in Usdan 108 on Friday the 13th from 4:30 p.m. to 5:30 p.m.. Students and parents will have the opportunity to hear the mayor speak about the future of the Wesleyan-Middletown relationship and opportunities to get involved in the wonderful Middletown community.  Any questions afterwards will be welcomed. -Why should pre-frosh come? It’s important to get a good feel for the community relationship when choosing a university.  We as members of the Wesleyan Dems feel very lucky to have such a close relationship with our new mayor and are excited to see what engagement opportunities are available in the future. -What’s so special about your event? This is the first time Mayor Drew will be on campus for an official event since the election.  If you’re interested in city government and politics, this is an event you cannot miss! We thought it was important to give pre-frosh an idea of political life on campus and decided the best way to do it was to combine politics and actual governance.  We are honored that Mayor Drew accepted our offer! -How do you think your event will attract new students to Wesleyan? Wesleyan has a vibrant political atmosphere and hopefully this event will give students who are interested in politics an opportunity to experience what we’ve done so far and what we have left to do. -Any surprises planned for the pre-frosh coming to your event? We in politics try to avoid surprises, if at all possible! Brighter Dawns -What they want you to know: Brighter Dawns is a non-profit committed to improving health conditions in slums in Bangladesh. Although we have been operating for just a year, Brighter Dawns was able to complete its first project in the summer of 2011, constructing 15 wells, 20 latrines, and three bathrooms in Ward 12, Khalishpur, Bangladesh. However, there are still thousands of people in Ward 12 who are placed at risk of deadly water-borne diseases every day. We aren’t your average nonprofit… Any given night you can catch us cooking in the kitchen at 5 a.m.; what can I say… We love to eat! -What/where/when is your event: Our 2nd annual 5k for Brighter Dawns. Registration is $10, and pre-registration can be complete at our website: www.brighterdawns.org/5k. Check-in at Long Lane Farm at 10:30 a.m., the race at 11 a.m. Walk, jog, or run with us to give impoverished people in Bangladesh the opportunity to live healthier lives! There will also be yummy baked goods. -Why should pre-frosh come to participate? The 5K for Brighter Dawns offers pre-frosh the opportunity to interact with current Wesleyan students, professors, fellow pre-frosh, and Middletown community members. There is no better way to get a feel of the Wesleyan community than uniting for a common cause and getting some exercise! -Why did your group decide to do an event, and why this event in particular? The 5K for Brighter Dawns is an annual event, which we decided to create in order to provide pre-frosh a glimpse of social entrepreneurship on campus. -Any surprises planned for the pre-frosh coming to your event? Would you like to divulge? No. We like to keep the surprises… well, surprises."
"From the Grassroots Up: Students Active in Politics","2012-09-17","by Madalene Smith-Huemer, Contributing Writer","With the upcoming elections less than two months away, political campaigns are running at full force, and the news seems to cover little else besides Paul Ryan’s budget, super PACs, and Michelle Obama’s attire at the Democratic National Convention. Even Hollywood is capitalizing on the campaign trend with blockbuster comedies such as “The Campaign,” which features Will Ferrell as a congressman from North Carolina, and the Hulu series “Battleground,” a documentary-style dramedy that depicts the lives of young campaign strategists. Given the University’s reputation for political activism, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that students are getting involved in the 2012 campaigns. From spending entire summers doing unpaid political canvassing to knocking on every residence hall door to register voters, there’s no lack of election and campaign enthusiasm at Wesleyan. Michael Linden ’15, current president of WesDems, the student group that supports Democratic candidates, said that he was initially hesitant to engage in campus politics but was pleasantly surprised by what he found. “I figured it would be a lot of liberals complaining, but it turned out to be more action-oriented than I expected,” he said. Last spring, Linden campaigned for Middletown’s current mayor Dan Drew and went door to door to register voters. It was an opportunity for students to make a difference in Middletown politics and engage with the community, he said. “The club [WesDems] was doing something to effect change, especially on a local level,” Linden said. “Compared to a Senate race, the mayor of Middletown was actually decided by a couple hundred votes, so we definitely contributed to the victory.” It may also seem that Wesleyan has a decidedly one-sided political atmosphere, but a strong component of political activism on campus is the debate over the fiscal and social issues surrounding the 2012 election. “People have strong opinions but I’ve had plenty of good discussions that are never hostile or aggressive,” said Monica Sheridan ’15, a member of the College Republicans. Although Wesleyan’s student body tends to lean to the left, Sheridan holds that it’s still a political spectrum. “There are a lot of people who don’t identify with either party and some who are fiscally more moderate or conservative than they think,” Sheridan said. Last year, the College Republicans also campaigned in Middletown’s mayoral contest by canvassing and volunteering for then-incumbent Republican Sebastian Giuliano. They also brought in several Republican speakers. Many of the students involved in campus political activism extend their work after leaving Wesleyan at the end of the school year. Linden continued his political work this summer as a field manager in his native Michigan. He campaigned for state representative Gary Peters in Michigan’s ninth congressional district, worked six to seven days a week from 12-8 p.m., and  made countless phone calls canvassing door to door. Many agree with Linden’s belief that students working in grassroots campaigns can make a big difference in voter turnout. Sometimes all it takes to bring people to the polls is a little extra push. “People care but are intensely lazy,” Linden said. “If you remove all barriers, it’s much more likely that they’ll vote.” In addition to informing residents about the political views of Peters, Linden heard some interesting and divergent points of view from people he met while canvassing. “One man told me that Obama’s policies reminded him of the rise of Hitler,” he said. Whit Chiles ’13 spent his summer working as an organizing fellow for Barack Obama’s campaign in swing-state Ohio. Representing the grassroots side of the campaign, Chiles made phone calls and met with potential volunteers during the workweek, and canvassed on the weekends; he averaged about one hundred doors each Saturday. Chiles said his commitment to Obama’s reelection came from Obama’s 2008 victory, and the impact it made on him personally. “Election night 2008 was just such a powerful moment,” he said. “It signified a big change in the course of American politics. Some people were disillusioned by Obama’s first term in office, and it would have been easy to become apathetic, but Romney is out of touch. It’s worth spending my summer in Ohio for something I believe in.” While confident about Obama’s chances, Chiles sees money as the biggest obstacle to the President’s reelection. As billionaires like Sheldon Adelson donate millions to pro-Romney super PACs, the President has struggled to out-fund his opponent. Chiles sees superPACs and voter suppression as key factors in the election. “The rich drown out the voices of average citizens,” Chiles said. “It’s a huge problem in American politics.” Evidently for Chiles, it’s a problem worth fighting against. While most students are too busy to dedicate as much of their time to campaigns this fall, the summer was a crucial season for canvassing and other election work. “The summer was laying groundwork—getting back supporters from two years ago, applying for endorsements, planning out the mail campaign, designing literature,” explained Ben Florsheim ’14, who worked on state representative Geoff Luxenberg’s campaign for reelection in Manchester, Conn. Florsheim has interned with other politicians and is especially familiar with election strategy. “I’ve interned with big campaigns before, but working on a more concentrated, smaller campaign gave me more insider knowledge,” Florsheim said. The most important factor for Luxenberg’s reelection, according to Florsheim, is maintaining the support from two years ago. “You need grassroots support before you can start making inroads with other voters,” Florsheim explained. Without the support and engagement of average citizens, politicians couldn’t effect change. It’s easy for people working in politics to feel unrecognized and insignificant within the greater campaign, but many students argue for staying involved because they know their efforts will contribute to their candidate’s success. With November approaching quickly, it can be the small efforts made by students and other volunteers that end up tipping the scales. Although big changes aren’t always apparent after a long day of canvassing, volunteers like Linden are aware that their efforts can pay off. “There were at least one or two conversations each day that made me feel like I’d made a meaningful difference,” he said."
"WSA Forms New Diversity Committee","2012-09-27","by Daniel Greenberg, News Editor","The Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) announced last Tuesday, Sept. 25, that it was forming a new subcommittee of the Community Outreach Committee (COCo) called the Committee for Inclusion and Diversity (CID). This committee, which will begin meeting in early October, is slated to work to facilitate discussions about diversity issues at the University through both outreach and organized events. “[We want] to import consistency into discussions of inclusion and difference on campus,” said WSA Representative and CID Chair Christian Hosam ’15. “Because I think racial discussion, class discussion, gender discussion, sexuality discussion, and anything else…all of those discussions should be happening for everyone on some level. So I think providing a context for it every year or semester is really the biggest part of this committee.” Members of the WSA and other students involved with diversity issues began discussing the formation of such a committee toward the end of the Spring 2012 semester. Some members of the WSA stated that they wanted to have a better response to controversial issues surroundings topics such as race and ethnicity than they had in the past. Last April, for instance, an incident occurred during the traditional spring festival of colors, Holi, at which time flyers were posted that read “NO COLORED PEOPLE ALLOWED IN USDAN,” in reference to the colored powder that participants throw at each other during the festival. Another discussion about race occurred in the fall of 2010, when the Cardinal Conservatives held an anti-affirmative action bake sale in which baked goods were priced differently for various ethnicities. “The WSA seemed to lack any structure to deal with issues of diversity and inclusion,” said COCo Chair Syed Ali ’13. “So with incidents such as the one last year with the flyer in Usdan, it was really evident. We have committees on everything from dining options to need-blind…but diversity seemed like a big one to miss out on.” Hosam echoed the need for a WSA committee that focuses on such issues. “There was a big discussion on Holi and on the affirmative action bake sale,” Ali said. “These can be productive, but after that discussion takes place it kind of peters out, without there being something to follow up on. There’s kind of an undercurrent of all the ‘-isms’ which are present here, but people don’t have a formal place to have a consistent dialogue about this and that is what this committee would hopefully bring.” The CID will consist of two WSA representatives and three non-WSA representatives. Though the three non-WSA members have not yet been chosen, Ali did mention that WSA Representative Alton Wang ’16 would be a part of the CID. “It would [consist of] students who have a commitment to diversity and social justice on this campus,” Hosam said. “They have [to have] a passion and a care for making sure that everyone’s voice is included.” According to Hosam, the CID would primarily focus on outreach, specifically to the more marginalized groups on campus. He believes this outreach would allow the concerns of more groups on campus to be heard. He also hopes to use the CID as a vehicle for greater interaction between such groups on campus. “Hopefully this committee is going to coordinate a lot of dialogue between groups that would not have talked previously,” Hosam said. “Kind of like a catalyst that [should] have been there [before].” The CID would also work on organizing initiatives both on its own and through partnership with people such as Vice President for Institutional Partnerships and Chief of Diversity Sonia Mañjon and Dean of Diversity and Student Engagement Renee Johnson-Thornton. Hosam speculated that such initiatives might include both discussions and events about diversity and inclusion. One idea he suggested was to have a diversity event during freshman orientation, similar to the BiLeGaTAs discussions. “There’s no big campus-wide event every year that focuses on understanding difference on campus concerning race, gender, or sexuality, [which I’d like to see],” Hosam said. Given its recent formation, the future of the CID and its effect on both students and the University as a whole remain unknown. Yet both Hosam and Ali were certain that the University needed an organization like the CID. “There are definitely issues to deal with,” Ali said. “Even though we have a more diverse campus than others, in many ways, it’s still not perfect.”"
"The Problem with “Resigned Acceptance” in the Need-Blind Debate","2012-10-04","by Eric StephenKevin Arrit, 2013","In the most recent weekly poll put out by Wesleying asking “Which option below aligns most closely with your thoughts on the administrative plan to scale back need-blind admissions?,” the most popular student response has been, “I don’t like it, but I think it’s necessary, considering the University’s financial situation.” Bracketing the concerns of representative sampling and the limited responses offered to the question, this sentiment of “resigned acceptance”—of “I don’t like it, but I think it’s necessary, considering the University’s financial situation”—nonetheless seems to pervade our campus. And it is not difficult to see why: it is exactly what we have been told to believe. In Michael Roth’s interview with The Argus on Sept. 10, he stated, “This is a business decision, and it’s terrible, but it’s not as terrible as the alternative.” Need awareness is simply an economic necessity, end of story. While student response to this interview—ranging from The Need Blind Focus Group postering fliers to an editorial written by the Editors-in-Chief of The Argus and a senior editor of Wesleying—was strong and focused in many ways on the political implications of such a change in policy, Roth’s interview was followed soon after by a piece by Economics Professor Gil Skillman on Sept. 16. As former Chair of the Faculty, Skillman wrote to the Need Blind Focus Group of his deep support for a need-blind policy, but also points to the economic circumstances that make this policy pragmatically infeasible in light of the University’s current financial situation. And thus the mentality of “resigned acceptance” was born, held up by the hands of faculty as logically sound. The goal of this Wespeak is to criticize this “resigned acceptance” mentality from two perspectives. The first is that of Roth, who has, over the course of what we will argue to be a poorly transparent dialogue with students, framed the debate as almost solely economic. This line of argument both works to ignore the political implications that went into and will result from the need-aware policy and also provides an effective way to ignore the serious questions of integrity about our institution. The second is the perspective of Skillman, who does provide an economic-political argument for need awareness but fails to address what we feel to be the full reality of the situation. As a result, we believe that the mentality of “resigned acceptance” stands on weak ground at best. We must as a student body dig deeper into this issue and hold the University accountable for its decisions that will affect both current and future generations of Wesleyan students. We begin with Roth. On the front page of the Wesleyan website, right above links to “Give,” “Apply,” and “Tour,” there is a link to the “Wesleyan 2020” blog. Adopted by the Board of Trustees in May 2010, “Wesleyan 2020” provides a framework for planning over the next 10 years. Goal Three of this framework is to “work within a sustainable economic model while retaining core values,” which includes an objective to “maintain [a] ‘need blind’ admissions policy.” The “Wesleyan 2020” blog exemplifies that questions concerning financial aid are not simply economical, but also ethical. The University explicitly acknowledged in the creation of “Wesleyan 2020” that economic practicality must be taken into account,  the idea of not discriminating against applicants on the basis of their family’s socioeconomic status exists within the fundamental value system of the University. In a forum hosted by Wesleying on Monday, Sept. 24, Roth began his short speech preceding a Q&A by stating that “if we had more money, we wouldn’t be having this conversation,” suggesting that the “conversation” is “being had” because the University is pragmatically in financial trouble because of its model and must decide what, if any, economically unsustainable practices should be privileged over sustainability. However, given “Wesleyan 2020,” it appears that this “conversation” had already happened in 2010. The question becomes whether the circumstances of the University’s economic standing have changed drastically enough in two years that the issue required revisitation by the President and the Board. At the Sept. 24 forum, this question was not answered. The information that Roth presented, however, was also already largely available when “Wesleyan 2020” was passed—tuition dependence from 2005 to today, financial aid as a percentage of the total budget from 1997 to today, etc. From the graphs presented, it also didn’t appear as though there were huge jumps between 2010 and 2012. Was “Wesleyan 2020” passed without any forethought as to subsequent trends, without any consideration for future sustainability? How is it that our President and Board of Trustees were able to pledge support to “maintain [a] ‘need blind’ admissions policy” in a way that was “economically sustainable” in 2010 but claim, as Roth does in the forum, that “there would be no prospect of maintaining the University at all 10 years from now” in 2012? Door #1 is administrative naivety in 2010; Door #2 is a fundamental, unpredictable economic shift over the last two years; Door #3 is a shift away from the “core values” discussed in “Wesleyan 2020.” Students are left to play Let’s Make a Deal with the reason why. Maybe the answer is conveniently tucked away behind one of those doors; maybe the answer is an intricate amalgamation of all three; maybe some other unseen door exists. We simply do not know. And it is precisely because we do not know (and because of the possibility of Door #3) that “resigned acceptance” proves problematic. Additionally, three other problems lurk in this Let’s Make a Deal game that Roth is forcing students to play. The first problem is of accountability for how this University is represented. It appears that the President and the Board of Trustees are able to tear down the “core values” they espoused just two years ago to applicants and current students without explanation or recourse. This sets a dangerous precedent for the institution to be able to walk back on any position it makes and brings into question whether these “core values” are true or just for show. It appears that their actual values shift with the winds. The second is the problem of transparency. This is thoroughly laid out in the Sept. 13 article “Campus Editors for Need-Blind,” written by the Argus Editors-in-Chief and a senior Wesleying editor, and does not need to be rehashed here by students less versed about the issue of transparency than them. If you have not yet read it, suffice it to say that the authors of the editorial trace out, in great detail, the ways in which they believe they were not only misled as reporters by the administration, but also how they felt conversations about a policy shift and its final announcement were made with calculated language and with calculated timing. Given what we ourselves have seen, we agree. And the only defense of transparency by the administration, in response, appears to be to scapegoat the few students who were involved in the “conversations”, suggesting—as one member of the Board of Trustees did at the Sept. 23 meeting that was disrupted by students—that these few students 1) were privy to all information and 2) had the burden of responsibility to pass it on to the student body. While we indeed have student representatives for the purposes of working with the administration, we feel that the gravity of the situation is one that requires transparency to all and not just a half-hearted claim that “we’ve been transparent the whole time” simply because a few students were told selective information. We believe that such a lack of transparency and the failure of Roth to be explicit about the reason for the policy change from two years ago when a ten year plan was crafted lead students, rightly or wrongly, to tend toward Door #3. Wesleyan’s values have shifted, not its economic situation. The final problem is that of community. In the Sept. 24 forum, Roth analogizes need-blind financial aid to the “Robin Hood Financial Aid Process.” Indeed, we are not ignorant to the obvious reality that some of the tuition of those students whose parents can pay goes to the financial aid of those whose parents cannot. However, students find value in socioeconomic diversity, and it appears to be a value also enshrined in the institution’s “core values” according to “Wesleyan 2020.” Ignoring the relative value of financial aid for students in the way that Roth is doing in order to create and maintain his economic argument generates a feeling of alienation among students on financial aid. These students, in the eyes of the University, rest on the economic backs of those who can afford to come; we have been collapsed into a dichotomy of “those who can pay” and “those who cannot,” a simplifying and divisive conglomeration. His rhetoric, whether intentionally or unintentionally, frames students on financial aid as ultimately a burden on a University that was intended to exist as a playground for the wealthy and is able to close its doors to these undesirables just as easily as it had opened them. Perhaps that is true; perhaps this process is indeed simply one of realizing the elitism associated with liberal arts institutions more broadly. But is the job of a president not to at least pretend that everyone matters equally, to articulate a vision that each student is unique and contributes to the intricate web of interests and values that “Diversity University” is known for? For someone who has done such a superb job of reframing the entirety of the need-blind issue, it is shocking how little concern Roth is showing for students currently on financial aid in the process. As a result, some students on financial aid now are beginning to feel either like accidents or socioeconomic tokens, dissociated from the University they were told was diverse and accepting. If we resign ourselves to a solely economic perspective, we lose any semblance of seeing value in having students on financial aid here at all. Here we see again the concern of Door #3. We believe that Roth’s line of argument is weakly formed, disregards the obvious political considerations in a way that further limits transparency, operates in a way that treats financial aid students as an onus to the entire Wesleyan community, and is fundamentally inconsistent with the values that Wesleyan has historically bolstered, including those found in “Wesleyan 2020.” To be sure, Roth has left students with nothing but questions since the announcement of the need-aware policy in May, largely because of his failed rhetoric and lack of transparency. We feel that these are both areas that Professor Skillman attempts to address; his writing operates transparently and with an argument that incorporates both the politics and the economics of the situation. Indeed, Professor Skillman provided the student body with a thoughtful and articulate analysis of the structure of Wesleyan’s current problems. One can look through Professor Skillman’s published work or take a couple minutes to talk to him in person, and it is clear that he is articulate, brilliant, and cares about Wesleyan students. However, we believe that Skillman’s piece has shed light on only some of the writing on the wall, and the student mentality of “resigned acceptance” should not follow unquestioningly from his claims. The point on which Professor Skillman expands the most is in discussing how Wesleyan offers less-than-generous financial aid packages. He coins the term “need-neutral” and defines it as “hav[ing] the same true net coverage of assessed financial need, regardless of the level of need.” With respect to need-neutrality, Professor Skillman states that “there are two key dimensions in play regarding the competitiveness, and thus the effective need-neutrality, of our financial aid packages: how expansively the institution defines ‘need’ (including such considerations as what earnings expectation it has for students and how many trips home during the school year are allowed), and what percentage of assessed need is met by loans instead of grants.” Based on this, he concludes that a need-aware policy with a financial aid cap would both help the University to not overspend its operating budget on financial aid and also provide the possibility of giving students who receive financial aid more competitive packages. We believe that this is not in-line with the reality of the situation in two respects. First, and most simply, Roth and the Board of Trustees have not discussed how we will increase grants and decrease loans in the near future. They have instead chosen to focus their discussion on how we can curb spending on financial aid. While it is possible that both can happen simultaneously, we believe that obvious questions arise as to whether the former actually will occur given that it has not been a point of discussion by administrators crafting the policy, at least in public. The novelty of this argument blends into our second concern regarding the reality of the situation: accountability. How can this school be held accountable for offering more grants and fewer loans? For what Skillman is proposing here to be placed into practice, the Office of Financial Aid and the Office of Admissions must be intimately involved. And yet these offices have been surprisingly silent on the issue of need-blind more broadly, let alone how packages will change. Can we really say “I will accept need-awareness if it means that accepted students on financial aid will get better deals” if we have no idea whether this will even occur? To be sure, we are not advocating here for the admissions or financial aid process to be completely transparent; that would be pragmatically unfeasible, if not impossible. And yet are we ready to sacrifice a need-blind admissions process based on a hunch that one professor holds but no administrator has voiced as something that will be a reality in the near future? For this shift to work, it must be deeply accepted by the hive-mind of the University and explicated to a variety of departments and offices. Without this, it will fall. We believe that, while Skillman’s argument is indeed possible, it does not prove realistic based on what we have seen thus far. Additionally, with a hint of irony, Skillman’s failure to elucidate accountability fortuitously exposes potential areas of exploitation. A cap is simply that: an upper limit. Nothing stops the University from operating below that cap. Although we do not find this to be particularly probable, the problem we see is that there is no mechanism of accountability that prevents it or even prevents the potential for that cap to be lowered in subsequent years in order to say that we are spending up to the cap. When a slippery slope is veiled, it does not mean it is not there. Here we come to see that not only is the need-awareness policy questionable from a value perspective, but also riddled with holes of accountability in the way it was crafted. And the potential for exploitation because of these holes is never addressed by Skillman. From there, Skillman goes on to discuss how the percentage of students in the middle class has been dropping, which therefore indicates a failure of need-blind. He seems to imply that this is because Wesleyan cannot provide as competitive of financial aid packages as other schools because of its financial situation. But there is no counterfactual situation that is discussed. What are the causal impacts of need-blind that would somehow lead to the middle class dropping out? It is entirely within the realm of possibility that the income distribution at Wesleyan will become even more skewed if we cut need-blind but do not increase grant size (as is the current structure that is proposed by Roth and the Board of Trustees). Pointing to the increase in high-income students as a reason for why need-blind has failed as a policy parallels pointing to the high unemployment rate and saying that it is proof that Obama’s stimulus package failed. Yes, we have high unemployment, but many believe it would be much higher without the stimulus. Just because a policy has not been a silver-bullet to end a problem does not mean that the policy is necessarily ineffective. The need-blind issue is more complex than one single policy and one single outcome. Overall, we find any argument that cutting need-blind helps the middle class to rest on shaky ground at best, as the administration has not been open to discussing how loans will be decreased and grants will be increased in the near future. This shift away from need-blind is meant to curb spending, not to redistribute aid. We do not mean to say that Skillman is in the wrong. Indeed, he is a brilliant man, and we applaud him for taking the initiative to create a dialogue when he saw that conversations with the administration were failing. However, without a response this is not dialogue at all. We do not believe that Skillman simply hopes for “resigned acceptance” as a result of his email either; we invite a rebuttal and hope for a continued dialogue between Skillman and students. The most common response we hear to our criticism over student “resigned acceptance” is questioning the need for student involvement at all. We are students, and Wesleyan is a business; it will sometimes make decisions that they feel are necessary, and who are we to have any say whatsoever since we are not even close to qualified to deal with these problems. To this we respond that our University is not Rite Aid—it is not a business that is set up and decides at what prices to set its goods, and then it is up to us to decide if we want to shop there or at CVS. The University has a longstanding history of student engagement and involvement, where student voices do not trump absolute necessities but are still taken into consideration with due respect. We are more than just consumers. We are a community. And as such we deserve some say in the policies that will drastically affect us. Indeed, there is nothing illegal about running Wesleyan like Rite Aid (and we mean no disrespect to Rite Aid either), but it does lead to deep questions about our value system and integrity more broadly. We are also not ignorant to the fact that mechanisms are coming into place. Most notably, WSA President Zach Malter has developed a Student Budget Sustainability Task Force, which will work on the development of possible alternatives to these issues. But we want to note here as well that it was a student who forced his foot into the closing door of the administration. This was not developed out of administrative transparency, but instead out of student action and the rejection of “resigned acceptance.” Indeed, maybe this group will determine that need-awareness is the best solution, or that other alternatives are not feasible. But at least student voices will be heard, and we will not resign ourselves to what we are told. The move from need-blindness to need-awareness is one that troubles many members of the Wesleyan community. We assume (hope?) that there are very few students that will raise their hands and applaud discrimination based on socioeconomic status in the admissions process. But nonetheless, at least as the Wesleying poll shows, many students are willing to accept it, for reasons that we believe are insufficient to warrant such a toll in values. The Wesleyan community is already changing even before the arrival of the Class of 2017, as students currently on financial aid begin to feel ostracized and burdensome. And we do not know what is yet to be seen. Now is not the time for “resigned acceptance.” It is the time for asking questions. It is the time for holding the administration accountable for its actions. It is the time for making sure that the University is not shying away from its “Wesleyan 2020” values that we as students also believe in. It is the time to make sure that Wesleyan does not turn into a convenience store, that consumer collaboration and consideration is taken into account. It is time to be critical and make sure that this truly is necessary given the gravity of the ramifications. Do not choose “resigned acceptance.” Do not choose anything. Require more transparency, accountability, dialogue, and explanation before any major decisions are made."
"Middletown Schools Refute Allegations of Funds Misuse","2012-10-08","by Lily Baggott, Assistant News Editor","There have been recent allegations of misappropriation of Title I grant funding at Middletown public schools. According to these allegations, funds have been distributed to entities that do not qualify for funding and have been appropriated for services not intended to receive coverage under Title I. New Superintendent of Middletown Public Schools Dr. Patricia Charles has denied any wrongdoing by Middletown school administrators. The Title I program, which was created by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, provides additional funding to schools serving low-income students. The district administrators allocate the federal grants to the schools, and the funds are re-appropriated on a 10-to-15-year cycle. “In general, Title I is a federal entitlement program,” said Middletown Public Schools’ Director of Grant Services Elizabeth Nocera. “It is an entitlement grant that comes through the federal budget into individual states on a formulaic basis. Title I is included in what’s now commonly called No Child Left Behind, but that actually is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.” The Middletown Public School District uses the free or reduced lunch rate from the previous October to determine which schools are eligible for Title I funding, according to Nocera. Schools with 40 percent, which is the district average, or more of the student body on the free or reduced lunch rate qualify for the funding. “For the local level we use the free and reduced lunch rate,” Nocera explained. “We also could use TANF, which is Temporary Aid to Needy Families, but there are so few families that qualify for TANF. [Schools] are ranked by their free and reduced rate, and if a school falls below the district average, then they are not eligible for Title I services.” On the federal level, the funding is granted based on a complex formula including rolling poverty rates. Last year, the Middletown school district received approximately $707,000 in Title I funding. This year, the district administrators hope to receive around $680,000. “[Title I] provides additional support for some of our neediest schools,” Charles said. “Some of the money we use directly is targeted to specific schools and other parts of that money are [used] generally.” Currently, four of the eight public elementary schools in Middletown are designated Title I schools: Commodore Macdonough, Frederick J. Bielefield, Farm Hill, and Bertrand E. Spencer. According to Nocera, the Middletown school district only considers elementary schools for Title I funding. “The opportunity that districts have to serve particular schools comes depending on what grade level the school serves,” Nocera explained. “Our middle schools may be eligible for Title I services, but as a district we have the opportunity to select the grade levels that we want to serve. Those decisions are made at the local level. We make a local decision to concentrate our resources at the elementary level.” While the decision to withhold Title I funding from middle and high schools is allowed by law, all elementary schools that qualify for the funding must be served, according to Nocera. In addition, private elementary schools in Middletown must receive Title I funding at the district-wide per pupil rate. The rate is derived from the total amount of grant funding divided by the number of students eligible for the free or reduced lunch rate. Currently the per pupil rate is $600 in Middletown; it includes all attendees at the schools that receive the funding. “[Title I funds] are school-wide programs,” Nocera said. “So all of the students in those schools are considered to be Title I students.” Charles agreed with Nocera’s statement. “Some schools would have greater poverty [rates] than others, and so the allocation [is] per child,” Charles said. “You’ve got more kids, you get more money.” Nocera explained the process of determining the distribution of funds. “We get a district amount and then we have to calculate what the non-public portion of the grant is,” Nocera said. “So some of it is allocated to the non-public schools. We have to take their word for it; they don’t have to complete forms or anything.” The costs of certain programs, such as the Snow School pre-school, administration, parent involvement, and professional development, are removed before the grant money is divided into the per-pupil rate. “There are certain costs that we are allowed to remove off the top, and then the balance has to be distributed to the non-public schools and the qualifying elementary schools,” Nocera explained. Executive Director of the North End Action Team (NEAT) Izzi Greenberg said that over the past several years, many people in the Middletown community suspected that Title I funds weren’t being used properly. “My sense from previous years is that they may have been paying for things that were not really above and beyond the other schools, which is what Title I is designed for,” Greenberg said. Nocera said the primary indicator of need for supplemental services is the adult to student ratio. She said that this is different from supplanting funds. “The words that [are] often used in grants [are] supplanting versus supplementing,” Nocera explained. “And you want to ensure that the adult to student ratio is lower in Title I schools, because it is intended to be supplementary.” Charles said the Title I schools do in fact have a smaller ratio of adults to students. She refuted any allegations of wrongdoing. “[Title I] absolutely is being appropriated correctly,” Charles said. “I think there is a misconception that there is some misuse of the funds. The schools that have the Title I program do get more than our other schools.” Charles noted that she is not familiar with previous allegations related to Title I. “I’m a newcomer; I don’t know whether this has come up in the past,” Charles said. “I’m hoping that we’re sort of nipping it in the bud.” Charles was hired as superintendent during the summer of 2012. Before Charles, Michael Frechette served as the superintendent of Middletown Public Schools, before resigning amidst controversy about “scream rooms” and other issues. Dr. David Larson briefly served as Interim Superintendent before Charles was named as Frechette’s replacement. Currently, Charles is operating with Frechette’s budget from the past year. “[Charles is] working with last year’s budget, which was created by a previous superintendent,” Greenberg said. “So any positions that are in place now, or any discrepancies that may exist were essentially not her doing.” In particular, the administrative position of Parent Resource Coordinator has attracted controversy. “We do use a position that covers parent involvement in the district that does provide some services to some of the other schools,” Nocera said. “But in fact we are working this year to ensure that a portion of that salary is apportioned to other grants.” According to Charles, the speaking engagements and workshops that the Parent Resource Coordinator organizes should not exclude parents from schools that do not receive Title I funding. “If we bring in a speaker and there’s room for other elementary teachers to participate, of course we would let them participate,” Charles said. According to Nocera, parents with students at both Title I schools and non-Title I schools add to the confusion. “First of all, one of the difficulties is that parents have children in multiple schools,” Nocera said. “So, it could be a Macdonough parent that also has a child at Keigwin, Woodrow Wilson, and Middletown High. So to exclude other parents doesn’t make any sense; that’s not the spirit of Title I.” As with other grants, city auditors review the Title I funding each year, employing federal guidelines, Nocera said. In addition, a more in-depth audit is performed on a three-year cycle. “So every year our compliance is checked,” Nocera said. Greenberg said she will continue to look into the allocation of Title I funding and encourages people to get involved in all parts of the education process. “NEAT’s job is to advocate for the interests of the neighborhood,” Greenberg said. “It’s important that everyone feel confident that the resources that are supposed to be supporting students are actually getting there. We are actively working on school issues, so if there are people who are interested in finding out more, they can contact us and be a part of that.”"
"A History of Need-Blind: The 1990s Controversy","2012-10-18","by Claire Bradach, Olivia Horton, Features Editors","The controversy surrounding the termination of Wesleyan’s need-blind admissions policy is not unique to this year; similar concerns about the University’s finances and the status of need-blind admissions were discussed campus-wide 20 years ago. In 1991, in the face of rising tuition rates and endowment issues (sound familiar?), then-President William M. Chace proposed ending the decades-old need-blind policy for applicants on the waitlist. Students protested through sit-ins, chants, committee meetings, and proposed alternative financial solutions, all of which led Chace to alter his decision.   Persistent Financial Woes The unsteady state of the endowment was publicized in an Oct. 9, 1990, article in The Argus titled “Endowment Falls 10 Percent Since July.” According to the article, the University’s endowment fell $27 million from July to October, a decline that the then-Executive Assistant to the President William D. “Bro” Adams attributed to the downturn in financial markets. To combat the issues associated with a smaller endowment and to mitigate the projection that student tuition and fees would rise by eight percent for the 1991-1992 school year, the University enacted an administrative hiring freeze. An article published on the front page of the Dec. 7, 1990 issue of The Argus reported Chace’s confirmation that no new non-academic personnel would be hired for the remainder of the 1990-1991 academic year and also that a “no-growth budget” was under consideration for the 1991-1992 year. According to the article, financial aid was a department under consideration for reductions. In December of 1990, Chace met with the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) to seek advice about how to incorporate student input into the University’s plans to reduce budget deficits. On Mar. 3, 1991, an article was published in The Argus titled “Scramble to Remain Need-Blind in Face of Grave Budget Cuts.” “Chace said need-blind admissions has been ‘one of the most effective tools’ in creating a diverse student body at the university. However, Chace said he is ‘less wed to need-blind admissions than to the aim it is meant to achieve.,” the article reads. The same article announced that the classes of 1995 and 1996 would be admitted on a need-blind basis, but Director of Financial Aid Edwin Below said that the future of the University’s need-blind policy was unclear beyond the immediate future. “[Need-blind admissions] is not something that is in imminent danger,” Below said to The Argus in 1991. “I couldn’t say whether we’re going to have need-blind admissions in the year 2000—that’s something that’s too far to tell, but in the next two or three years, I don’t see that changing.” While need-blind admissions at the University had been practiced since the 1960s or 70s, it was not an official policy. A Sep. 10, 1991, article in The Argus revealed information about the financial aid budget that suggested that changes would indeed need to be made. Aid for the class of 1995 ended up costing $800,000 more than projected. “Our [need-blind] policies are such that we are facing the possibility that similar shocks which wreak havoc to our budget can be suffered again,” Chace said in the September article. One month later, Chace was quoted in The Argus as saying, “[While] it will be a priority to preserve the integrity of need-blind admissions, we can’t allow financial aid to be unwatched, ungoverned, unsupervised.” In response to the threat to need-blind, members of the group Students for Financially Accessible Education (SFAE) called for students to write letters to trustees expressing concern with the possibility of ending need-blind admissions. The group also advertised its weekly meetings. Three hundred students wrote letters to the board in favor of maintaining need-blind and urging the administration to make it a formal policy.   Chace’s Proposal In a statement published in The Argus on Nov. 22, 1991, Chace announced a five-year plan that, among other measures designed to strengthen the University’s finances, proposed to take financial need into account for students on the waitlist. “I am proposing that the University continue to admit the freshman classes ‘aid-blind’ in the regular admissions process through April 1 of each year (and continue to fund their full, established need for four years),” Chace wrote, “and the offers of admission from the waiting list take into account all institutional priorities, including increasing selectivity, yield and quality, and, if necessary, financial circumstances.”   Responses to the Proposal According to a Nov. 23, 1991 article in The Middletown Press, 75 students met at a forum to protest Chace’s proposal after it became public. Philip Buchanan ’92, a member of the Student Institutional Priorities Advisory Committee, was quoted in The Middletown Press article as saying, “it becomes dangerous once you play with aid-blind admissions at all.” Reflecting back on the protests of the early nineties, Leslie Gerhart ’95 echoed this concern about the permanence of a shift to a need-aware policy. “What we felt in ’91 is if you slide on [need-blind admissions] now, there’s no coming back,” Gerhart said. “There’s no ‘Oh we’ll do it for a couple of years and then we’ll come back.’ Once you let that ball drop, there’s nothing that will force it to come back.” Many students at the time were concerned about the classist implications of the waitlist policy. Heather Rhoads ’92, a member of Students for a Financially Accessible Education, at the time told The Argus, “They can call this [need-blind], but it’s not…Administrators are talking about a way to insure themselves that they have enough students who can pay. People on the waiting list, it seems like they would be able to buy their way off—and I think it’s disgusting.” Following Chace’s proposal, the Hartford Courant picked up on the story as well and quoted Wesleyan spokesman Bobby Wayne Clark. The Courant article reads, “If ability to pay is ever considered as a factor for admission, it would be only in the case of a handful of students each year, [Clark] said.” In seeming contrast to Chace’s desire to bring the student body into the discussion through her appeal to the WSA, Clark went on to say, “Students do not run this place, and they shouldn’t be dictating [to us] on this.” On the afternoon of Saturday, Nov. 23, more than 350 students rallied outside of Downey House, where the Board of Trustees was meeting, to protest Chace’s proposal by waving banners, giving speeches, and clanking pots and pans. Thirteen students, representing groups including Society Organized Against Racism, the Student Institutional Priorities Committee, and Students for Financially Accessible Education, spoke. Students chanted outside of the meeting for about 10 minutes and were saying things such as “Save need-blind today, diversity has got to stay,” “Ho ho, hey hey, need-blind has got to stay,” and “Hey Bill, hey Bro, need-blind’s the way to go.” Others held signs with slogans like “My father is not a CEO, will I still get admitted?” At the rally, two students scaled the balcony of Downey House in order to be more visible to the trustees, but they were asked to descend by the then-Director of Public Safety Harry Kinne III. The students complied. The rally then ended after several statements, including one from Board of Trustees President Steven Pfeiffer, who acknowledged the protest and said he appreciated the students’ engagement with the issue. Rhoads and a member of Society Organized Against Racism claimed they heard Chace say, “This university will not change anything as a result of political pressure.” When the faculty met to discuss Chace’s proposal on Nov. 26, about 30 students held a silent protest outside of Shanklin 107, where the meeting was held, to protest their exclusion from the meeting. On Monday, Nov. 26, more than 350 students filled Exley 150 for a discussion and debate about Chace’s proposal. The meeting was organized by a group of students who wanted to ensure that students and staff members could have their voices heard even though they were not allowed to attend the faculty meeting that took place the same day. At the meeting students expressed general dislike of the policy, proposed a fundraising drive, and denounced the University’s beautification efforts as out of line with student priorities. Students expressed concerns that there were not more opportunities for the administration and student body to interact in discussions surrounding the proposed need-blind policy changes. They also questioned the prominent role played by the Student Institutional Priorities Advisory Committee (SIPAC), the members of which were elected by the WSA, not the general student population. SIPAC issued a statement saying the group was not prepared to endorse Chace’s proposal. Instead, the Committee made a list of alternative ways to reduce budgetary pressure. The list proposed further reductions in academic and non-academic staffs, and suggested a reexamination of graduate programs, the University’s sabbatical policy, varsity sports, and a larger tuition hike as places to save or gain money. Commenting on the debates of the nineties as compared to today, Brian Glenn ’91 said that community involvement in the earlier case was facilitated by Chace’s transparency. “What happened in the last debate was, the administration said, ‘We can’t afford it,’ and people said, ‘Let’s look at some alternatives,’” Glenn said. “This time around the administration said, ‘Well, we can’t afford it,’ and people can’t say, ‘Let’s look at some alternatives’ because the administration has been less than forthcoming about things that it’s already done.” On Dec. 10, 1991, the WSA sponsored an open meeting with administrators, faculty, and students to discuss Chace’s proposal. The WSA had passed a resolution the previous week publicly declaring their disappointment with Chace’s decision not to hold a public meeting. Administrators defended the proposal, with Chace emphasizing the difficult situation with which he was faced. Chace declared the meeting a success and said he planned to hold more similar meetings in the future with the hopes that forums with students would become regular events instead of responses to crises. Focus group meetings with administrators were organized on eight dates between Feb. 5 and Feb. 20, which gave students the opportunity to raise important issues with members of the administration including Vice President Joanne Creighton and Dean of Admissions Barbara-Jan Wilson. According to a Feb. 14, 1991, Argus article, however, student attendance at these forums was very low. SFAE organized a series of protests for the week of Feb. 24-29 designed to get the attention of the Board of Trustees, which had meetings that weekend. The protests included “phone zaps,” a speakout in the Campus Center, class boycotts that garnered the support of 1000 students, 1600 student signatures on petitions, and an occupation of a number of campus buildings. Students assembled at 10 a.m. on Thursday, Feb. 27, and split into groups to walk to the lobby of North College, the financial aid office, admissions office, second floor of North College, registrar’s office, and Deans’ office. The Middletown Press reported that as many as 440 students occupied the buildings. At about 3 p.m., students conducted negotiations with Dean of the College Janina Montero to allow 60 students to stay in North College and the walkway between North and South College overnight. More than 150 students braved temperatures in the teens to camp outside on Thursday night, with the number peaking around 1 a.m. The sit-in continued the next day, when 400 students held silent vigil in front of a Trustees’ meeting at Downey House. The meeting was intended to let the Board of Trustees’ finance and student affairs committees hear recommendations about the University’s financial situation and admissions practices. According to an article in The Guardian, “The protestors joined hands and encircled the building, handing symbolic ‘withdrawal forms’ to the trustees as they left the building.” Citing issues with financial aid and Chace’s proposal, 237 students symbolically signed withdrawal forms. During meetings on the last weekend in February, the Board considered several versions of the plan for the waiting list admissions policy but remained largely undecided. The trustees also commented on the protests by saying they were impressed by efforts like the phone zap in which students could express their opinions through phone calls to the Board, but they considered the sit-ins and chanting outside of meetings disruptive. According to The Argus’ articles from March 1991, student groups proposed additional alternatives, including a suggestion from SIPAC that the University increase housing costs by $150 per year to create a contingency fund for financial aid, and continued fundraising efforts.   Need-Blind Preserved On April 3, the protestors proved victorious, as Chace announced that he would keep need-blind admissions in place for all applicants. “The waiting-list proposal is now being relegated to a secondary position as a result of strong ideas from members of the community,” Chace said to The Argus. Instead of cutting need-blind aid, the administration decided to give aid packages with more loans and work-study. Chace’s committee was then given the task of figuring out how to raise money for a contingency plan that would protect the financial aid budget in case spending exceeded expectations. A third part of his revised plan involved the creation of a Financial Aid Overview Committee to oversee the implementation of the “revolving fund.” Students credited the protests for the solution. “The students showed the administration just how strongly they felt, and it had an impact,” said Elizabeth Toohey ’94, who was on the committee and a member of SFAE, to The Argus in 1991. “I don’t think the committee would even exist if it weren’t for student pressure.” Chace made later revisions to the plan before presenting it to the Board of Trustees for vote on May 9, but these versions omitted any mention of cutting need-blind aid."
"SJB Hears Need-Blind Protest Case","2012-10-19","by Lily Baggott, Assistant News Editor","At the beginning of October, the University pressed charges against nine students for violating Regulations 14 and 15 of the Code of Non-Academic Conduct (CNAC). In response to this action, Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) President Zachary Malter ’13 and Finance and Facilities Committee Chair Andrew Trexler ’14 sent a complaint to Clerk of the Student Judicial Board (SJB) Karen Karpa. The simplified hearing for the nine students occurred last night. “It seemed to be pretty standard procedure for the SJB, speaking from the position of someone who’s never been SJBed before,” said Anwar Batte ’13, who is one of the students facing charges. “We gave statements, they read from reports and evidence, and then they said they would call us with their decision around noon tomorrow.” According to Batte, the meeting, which lasted approximately 75 minutes, did not seem heated in any way. “I honestly have no idea what to expect,” Batte said. “It wasn’t adversarial or anything. I think the tone was pretty comfortable.” The charges are in response to the Sept. 23 protest, during which roughly 45 students gathered outside the Board of Trustees meeting in the Daniel Family Commons (DFC) to demand a part in the ongoing need-blind discussion. Only a few students were able to gain access into the meeting, while others sat in the doorway. “From what I remember, most of the SJB summons were sent to people who actually entered the room that the Board of Trustees meeting was in,” Batte said. The students were charged with violating Regulation 14, Failure to Comply, and Regulation 15, Department Regulations. “Members of the community are expected to abide by duly established and promulgated non-academic regulations,” Regulation 15 reads. “This is intended to cover the operating regulations of all University programs and facilities. These include, but are not limited to, the policies outlined under University Policies.” Under University Policies, there is a section regarding “Disruptions,” which states that if a protest disrupts administrative or operational activities of the University, the protest violates the Code of Non-Academic Conduct. “Through many different communications, the administration has identified the problem as the disruption of the meeting,” Trexler said. “We felt that it was a little unfair for the administration to be pursuing charges [through] Regulation 15 rather than through Regulation 12.” The complaint sent to the SJB highlights the fact that Regulation 12, Disruptions, protects student protests as long as they do not harm the freedom or safety of others. “The Code clearly says that if those people are playing by different rules then you can file a complaint,” Malter said. “I think the actions were clearly protected by [Regulation 12], and it’s self-evident to me from that. I still have not heard a convincing case as to why this language does not protect the students. And I don’t think students should be held accountable for rules that are contrary to those in the Code.” According to Trexler, this contradictory nature of the Code needs to either be clarified or changed after the SJB hearings. He noted that any changes would probably be made through the Student Life Committee, which is a joint committee between the WSA’s Student Affairs Committee and the Office of Student Life. “They’re [the administrators are] also willing to look at the codes after this whole affair and decide both with administrators and students, probably through the Student Life Committee, to talk about the code and determine if it’s contradictory,” Trexler said. “If so, it needs to be changed; if not, it has to be clarified.” Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students Rick Culliton wrote an email to the signatories of the complaint on Tuesday, Oct. 9. When asked to clarify his email, he said that the complaint was not in agreement with the University’s policy. “The complaint was asking for an injunction on the judicial process,” Culliton said. “What was requested in this case was different from what the policy intended. We’ve never had people request an injunction to stop the Judicial Board from hearing a case. That’s not the purpose of what the language is when it talks about enjoining a decision or situation.” Malter claims that clarifying the Code after the hearings have been held would be inadequate. “I don’t think that’s sufficient,” he said. “I think, by charging these students, the message has been sent that respectful, peaceful engagement is not okay. So I think it’s a step in the right direction to revisit the Code after, but the damage has been done, and I respectfully disagree with Dean Rick’s email. And I think the Code contradicts his points.” Culliton said that he believes the Code is currently coherent. “I think our disruptions policy is very clear,” he said. “There are ways for people to raise concerns about things that are happening on campus and decisions that are made that don’t disrupt other people’s ability to move, that don’t disregard what Public Safety has instructed people to do… When situations that cross those lines in terms of interrupting University business, or as the policy talks about the academic or curricular operations of the University, in those situations if there’s an alleged violation of the Code of Conduct, those situations would be referred to the Board to be reviewed at a hearing. I think that’s happened in this case.” Fifty-seven students signed the complaint. Although Malter and Trexler wrote the complaint as students, the WSA endorsed portions of the complaint on Oct. 7 in the “Student Judicial Reform Resolution,” available online at the WSA’s website. “It was signed by students from all areas of campus,” Malter said. “It was not exclusive to the WSA by any means. But the WSA did endorse it in a resolution.” The members of the SJB declined to comment on the case citing confidentiality requirements. However, SJB member Michael Onah ’13 wrote in an email to The Argus that the SJB does not press charges, but instead judges the charges that the University has brought against students based on the Code. “I do not have any knowledge of how the University plans to respond to the resolution,” he wrote. “The Student Judicial Board does not bring charges against students—we only adjudicate alleged violations of the Code of Non-Academic Conduct based on charges brought to us either through Public Safety, the University, or ResLife.” Both Malter and Trexler expressed concern for the University’s culture of activism following this incident. “I’ve heard from some students that they’re less inclined to get involved with this issue because of the judicial ramifications,” Malter said. “And I think that’s deeply problematic and could have huge negative impacts on the community if students are feeling discouraged from becoming active. I think the Code rightfully encourages students to be active… It’s really a core value. I feel that the administration’s actions with regard to this really run against that core value.” Cesar Chavez ’15, one of the students facing charges for the protest, agreed. “This is a very grave issue and could result in targeting activists in the future, something which is completely divergent from Wesleyan’s mission of diversity and tolerance of all groups,” he said. Though the final decision in the SJB hearing has yet to be announced, Benjamin Doernberg ’13, who is also facing charges, said that he welcomed the chance to explain his perspective on the protest. “I appreciated the opportunity to explain our actions, and I hope that the Board makes a fair determination,” Doernberg said. The final determination on what disciplinary action could be taken against the nine students will be issued to them by the end of the day on Friday, Oct. 19. Update Oct. 19, 2012 According to one protestor whose case was heard by the SJB, he was found responsible for violating Regulation 14, but not found responsible for violating Regulation 15. The result of this sanction for the student in question will be a disciplinary warning."
"Patricelli Center Puts Social Change in Career Path","2012-10-22","by Rebecca Seidel, Assistant Features Editor","On a campus bustling with activists, it’s easy to tap into the spirit of philanthropy and enthusiasm for social change. For those looking to channel this passion into a nonprofit business venture, or those trying to join the ranks of student leaders who are already doing so, the first place to go is the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. The Patricelli Center is housed in the basement of the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life. Founded last spring through a gift from the Robert [Patricelli ’61] and Margaret Patricelli Family Foundation, the Center provides resources and networking opportunities to students and alumni interested in starting nonprofit enterprises. Now in its second semester, the Patricelli Center is already a campus presence, offering workshops, grants, counseling, and internship opportunities to aspiring social entrepreneurs. The Center also offers extensive networking opportunities, drawing from connections to alumni involved in civic engagement. Its Board of Advisors includes alumni involved in prominent social enterprises, in addition to several members of Wesleyan’s faculty. According to the Center’s Civic Engagement Coordinator and Career Counselor Paul Gagnon, part of the value of having a center devoted to the pursuit of social entrepreneurship is that it offers students a chance to develop business skills not typically taught in classes. “We’re providing opportunities for students to develop skills of what I call a practical benefit, in areas that they might not necessarily get exposure to in their traditional Wesleyan classroom setting,” Gagnon said. To facilitate this type of training, the Patricelli Center holds workshops and seminars at regular intervals that are open to all students. The workshop scheduled for this Thursday, Oct. 25, called “Entrepreneurship Self-Assessment,” will help attendees gauge whether they have what it takes to start up their own business. The Center has also worked closely with a number of nonprofit groups on campus, including Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO), the MINDS Foundation, and Brighter Dawns. “Many of [these groups] actually predate the establishment of the Center, but the Center has helped [to] provide resources to those groups over the course of our first semester here and going forward,” Gagnon said. President and CEO of SHOFCO Kennedy Odede ’12 said he was grateful for the Patricelli Center and the work it does to help organizations such as his. “We will reach over 35,000 people in the Kibera slum this year through healthcare, clean water, community empowerment, and economic development programs,” Odede wrote in an email to The Argus. “This simply wouldn’t have been possible if the Patricelli family did not believe in the bold vision that change is possible even in places like Kibera, where the problems sometime seem insurmountable.” Raghu Appasani ’12, founder and CEO of the MINDS Foundation, noted that the Patricelli Center has offered him helpful business planning advice and connections with alumni since its establishment. “The Patricelli Center has been really helpful with networking,” he said. Connections with alumni are vital to the Patricelli Center’s endeavors. Since its founding, the Center has hosted several alumni guest speakers. The first speaker was Sasha Chanoff ’94, executive director of RefugePoint, a nonprofit offering assistance to refugees in Africa. Lara Galinsky ’96 ran a workshop hosted by the Patricelli Center last year centered on finding studnets’ passion. “It was a workshop-oriented process where students tried to do a self-assessment and identify with what Lara calls ‘heart, head, hustle,’” Gagnon recalled. “The three of those combined to help a student identify what it is that they think they might want to do with their career and their life. Outside of the Career Center, I’m not sure that there’s any other place on campus where a student would’ve been able to have that kind of exposure to that kind of program.” The Center also offers summer internships to Wesleyan students. Applicants put together proposals to work for specific social enterprise organizations or to start their own projects, and their applications are then reviewed by the Center. Additionally, the Patricelli Center offers grants for various student endeavors. It has a seed grant fund for student leaders seeking capital to start new social enterprises, and it also offers grants on a competitive basis for students to participate in off-campus social entrepreneurship training programs. Gagnon said that he hopes students will talk to him if they have ideas for organizations or projects they want to start. He outlined the steps he would take in guiding a student through hir ideas. “We’d be able to discuss it, and we’d be able to talk through some of the pertinent points that you’re trying to achieve,” he said. “I’d ask you to convince me why you want to pursue this. Convince me of your passion, and convince me of the underlying application to the nature of the problem you’re trying to address in the first place. Then I’d encourage you to make use of the workshops.” Gagnon added that the Center would work to connect a student with alumni, potentially find a mentor to help determine a direction for the project, and offer assistance with business mechanics like marketing and accounting. Above all, Gagnon said he wants the Patricelli Center to be a “home away from home” for aspiring social entrepreneurs. “Last spring, I’d say that this room acted as a clubhouse for a number of students because they were working on their company projects here, and that’s precisely the kind of environment that we want to foster and facilitate here,” he said. Co-president of Wesleyan’s chapter of the MINDS Foundation Ian Johnson ’13 expressed his appreciation for the Center’s resources. “We use the office space in there for all of our small meetings,” Johnson said. “Having the Patricelli Center also provides support and confidence for student entrepreneurship and collaboration.” Appasani agreed. “The office space in the Patricelli Center has been crucial for working late nights,” he said. Gagnon said that the number of non-profit campus groups is a testament to student dedication to social change. “It’s remarkable, the capability these students possess and their determination to get something done,” Gagnon said. “They’re so committed to making things happen—making a difference.” In a WesSeminar presentation on Oct. 18th, Gagnon cited data indicating that students these days are more interested than ever in careers involving civic engagement. A report done by Net Impact showed that 58 percent of students nationwide are willing to take a pay cut to work for an organization with values similar to their own. The same report found that a majority of students are confident that their work will eventually make a positive difference in the world. “When this generation cannot find a socially conscious job uniquely right for them, they create one,” Gagnon said. Additionally, Gagnon noted that in 2004 only about 20 colleges in the United States had a course or program focused on social entrepreneurship. Now, that figure is estimated to exceed 200. In some schools, social entrepreneurship comprises an entire department. Though there are many factors contributing to this attitude among young people, Gagnon said that it largely has to do with more students trying to link their passions to their career paths. “I think more and more young people are recognizing that there’s this need to do something that is larger than oneself,” he said. “I think that the students are seeing more than just being an individual or a cog in the wheel, and they’re trying to find something that more inspires their passions.” Gagnon said that beyond this generation’s inclinations toward social enterprise, Wesleyan in particular tends to generate lots of social entrepreneurs. “It seems like it’s just natural for Wesleyan to support this kind of activity and this kind of endeavor from a student’s perspective,” he said."
"Chi Psi Fraternity Returns to Campus After 11 Years","2012-10-25","by Miranda Katz, Assistant Features Editor","Until the brothers filled the building with sand for a beach-themed party, the community living space now referred to as 200 Church housed the Chi Psi fraternity. In September 2011, Matthew Sorkin ’15 and Benjamin Hoynes ’15 arrived at Wesleyan and found themselves ambivalent toward Wesleyan’s existing Greek societies, though they would soon become key players in bringing Chi Psi back to campus. “When we first found out about the former existence of Chi Psi, bringing it back seemed so unrealistic it was almost a joke,” Hoynes said. According to a 2009 Argus article, Chi Psi first came to Wesleyan in 1844. Some of the chapter’s illustrious alumni include Bill Belichick ’75 and Eric Mangini ’94. In 2001, however, after several violations of the Code of Non-Academic Conduct, the chapter was shut down. Now, 25 pledges are determined to bring back Chi Psi and change its reputation for good. The process began when Sorkin’s father, a Wesleyan alumnus of the Class of 1983, put him in touch with a Chi Psi alumnus in October 2011. During that Homecoming Weekend, several Wesleyan Chi Psi alumni held a conference with the potential brothers. “They essentially told us that the administration would never allow Chi Psi back on campus and that it would be nearly impossible to pull this off,” wrote Alexander Sakhno ’15, one of the founding members, in an email to The Argus. “However, they also told us that if we happen to succeed, then our names and actions will be remembered as long as Chi Psi exists. We didn’t back down.” In December 2011, the founding members—all freshmen at the time—drafted a petition for colony status. In February 2012, the national board granted that status. “Being a colony is a beginning step toward becoming a nationally recognized chapter,” Sorkin explained. “If we show that we’re operating better than half of the other chapters, having good engagement with the community and with the University, and having social events, we think we’ll be recognized.” The fraternity will petition for chapter status next year at the 2013 national convention at Wake Forest University. At that point, the colony will need to have at least 35 members. During this fall’s rush, the brothers added 14 members to their pre-existing 11; they hope to gain at least 10 more during another rush next semester. “We will start official pledging this fall, and the process will be mediated by Wesleyan Chi Psi alumni,” Sakhno said. “Over the past year we have been meeting several times a week, we have held rush events, participated in Relay For Life in conjunction with Clark Three, and held several celebration[s] encompassing the National office, our alumni, and Chi Psis from schools like Amherst College and Rutgers.” Chi Psi alumni have been integral in helping the colony through the process of gaining national recognition. In February 2012, alumni visited the University to lead a day of workshops on fraternity leadership and organization. In March, after the Wesleyan colony had been officially recognized, a national representative spent nine days with the founding members, during which time the founding members elected Sorkin and Hoynes as President and Vice President, respectively. Casey O’Neill ’93, who was a Chi Psi brother while at Wesleyan and who lives in nearby Connecticut, will act as pledge educator this semester, as all of the members are currently pledges. Gaining official recognition from the University, however, is a separate process from gaining recognition from the national fraternity. While Chi Psi is currently registered as a student group, it does not have the same status as the other Greek societies on campus and is only a provisional member of the Inter-Greek Council. Sorkin explained that Chi Psi alumni will handle this portion of the process. “So far this semester we haven’t necessarily been as focused on getting recognized by the University, partly because we can’t really control that—the alumni and national representatives will be more in charge of that,” Hoynes said. “But I would assume that now that we’ve reached some of our goals this fall, next semester there will be some steps as far as gaining official recognition.” Once recognized by the University, the fraternity would ultimately like to be integrated into campus housing. Chi Psi once occupied 200 Church, but the building now functions as a program house for freshmen and sophomores interested in diversity activism. While the brothers would love to move the fraternity back into 200 Church, they acknowledge that the house now has a different role in the Wesleyan community. “As cool as that would be for us, it’s not realistic, and it’s not something we’re going to really pursue,” Hoynes said. “We’re looking into a variety of options as far as housing is concerned.” The national fraternity of Chi Psi will help the brothers find a house once the Wesleyan colony becomes an official chapter and operates according to national standards. Yet while the brothers are eager to move the fraternity into a house, they recognize that they can still have a substantial presence on campus without official housing. “We’re happy with the progress we’ve made so far, and we feel we can contribute to the campus community even without a house,” Hoynes said. “There are other Greek organizations on campus that don’t have houses and still bring something to the table. Obviously that is a goal for us long-term, but right now we’re just focused on trying to earn the respect of the campus and let things fall into place with housing as we move forward.” Hoynes emphasized that the revival of Chi Psi is in no way an attack on the fraternities currently existing on campus. “The other fraternities do some really great things, and we have some good friends there,” Hoynes said. “I just would hope that as we move forward in this process, the campus community and the Greek community will be receptive and supportive of us and know that by no means do we want to disrespect any other fraternities here by doing this. We mean all the best, and we really hope to have good relations with all the other Greek organizations here.” The brothers are hopeful that Chi Psi will be known on campus not only  by its social events but also for its philanthropy and campus-wide programming. “Chi Psi really takes pride in its motto, ‘A Brotherhood of Gentlemen,’” Sorkin said. “A fraternity shouldn’t just be like what you see in Animal House—it shouldn’t just be about having parties, but [it should be] about having events, forming life-long relationships with the brothers, engaging in the community, and having an impact on campus.”"
"I’ll Donate When Wesleyan Earns My Donation","2012-10-26","by Nicholas Quah, Class of 2013","All right, I’m going to throw my hat into this ring. The University is cash-starved. Thus, the Wesleyan administration’s primary concern at this point in time is to try to find ways to maintain and develop a financial base that will allow it to do its job, which is to provide a liberal arts education according to a certain set of values. In other words, it has to find ways to survive in order to keep doing what it’s doing. In this pursuit, the University possesses two broad strategic directions which can and should be pursued simultaneously: (1) to increase cash inflow, and (2) to cut as much spending as possible in areas that it can practically bear. The University has thus far pushed a number of initiatives on both fronts. However, many of these initiatives are controversial. The University has chosen to make certain morally questionable investments to increase the cash inflow (catalyzing the emergence of the Committee for Investor Responsibility), and now has made a push to cut need-blind admissions (which has sprung up this entire conversation). As we have come to be quite familiar with, the core conflict here is the following: should the university compromise some of the fundamental values it purports to hold in the pursuit of mere institutional survival? Or, to put it another way: is it better to survive by compromising your principles, or is it better to struggle to commit to your original values, but risk a very possible end to your institutional existence? Indeed, in my mind, these questions lie at the periphery of a much deeper and infinitely more vital question: What the hell is the point of Wesleyan? There was a time in our history when Wesleyan was affiliated with fiercely liberal social values. These values included (but certainly were not limited to) a commitment to educational accessibility, to societal diversity, to free speech, to the unburdened pursuit of art and knowledge, to academic excellence, and to the holistic cultivation of its students. Furthermore, there was also a commitment to a higher value that transcended mere materiality. There was a sense that it is imperative that those who walk the halls of Olin should not only be people who could afford it, but for everybody who deserved a chance at a good education and subsequently a good life. A university has core practical responsibilities as well. A university is responsible for allowing its students to stand a chance of achieving gainful employment, for the securing the safety of its campus environment, and for being there when students need help in any and all forms. I submit that this constellation of values and responsibilities should be the point of Wesleyan. Of course, you are perfectly free to hold and voice your own views. You are perfectly free to believe that Wesleyan matters more as a physical institution, and that it should remain so no matter how far it may drift from the values and responsibilities it purports to hold. If this is the case, then I suggest you stop reading—in case you haven’t already. Now, I have been following these developments from afar quite closely, and a few things have come to my mind. Firstly, it seems odd to me that the administration is making the argument that the option to cut need-blind is absolutely imperative. That, under all these financial burdens, this is an absolutely necessary way to open enough financial breathing space. Is this truly the case? I cannot say anything about this for myself, for I am not privy to the accounting at hand. Secondly, surely it is the case that spending cuts can be made elsewhere in far less vital places. Surely we do not need all the amenities we seem to be getting. Are flat-screen TVs in residence halls and classrooms the most cost-effective and productive ways of enhancing Wesleyan’s educational experience? Do we really need flashy new construction projects for any reason other than safety? Will expanding the student body really cover the cash inflow problem, or will it exacerbate it instead? And finally, why in the world is President Roth doing an excruciatingly horrendous job at community engagement and communication? Aren’t we in the same boat, after all? But let me get to the point of why I started writing this entire piece in the first place. I fully defend the alums’ move to cease their donations. My reasoning is simple: while I understand that our donations may be vital to the supply of the University’s cash inflow, it can also be perceived as a tacit form of approval for the policies that the university is planning to enact in its pursuit to stay afloat. In other words, if I give you my money, you might—and probably will—take that as an indication that I approve of the decisions you are making. And it just so happens that I absolutely disagree with the direction that this university is moving towards. Some have made the argument that stopping our donations isn’t going to help – in fact, it’s making the situation worse. Indeed, I understand the anxiety and concerns from which this argument emerges, and I do hesitate in lending my support to this issue when I remember that this argument does come from students who depend on financial aid which in turn depends on our donations. But you know what? The school’s probably going to cut you anyway. And they might think I – along with other like-minded alum peers – are completely cool with it, and that they will not really be held accountable for it. Yes, I have a commitment to my alma mater. But my commitment is not blind. It is not uncritical. To rephrase it in more accurate terms: I have a commitment to the ideals my alma mater once shared with me. Right now, at this point in time, with Wesleyan’s failure to address sexual assaults, to properly build a sense of community and solidarity in a healthy fashion, and to make good and moral decisions to stay afloat, I cannot support you. I will not support you. And I will certainly not let you lie or talk down to me. Now, I graduated this past spring. And let me tell you, the emails asking for donations came very, very quickly. I graduated in the immediate aftermath of the Holi incident, where the University failed to take a normative stance on the matter, and right before all this crap kicked in. I graduated at a ceremony where the president gave what was ultimately a tepid speech – a speech full of clichés and tropes and empty pieces of inspirational sound-bites. A speech that was in essence all flash and very little substance. A speech that perhaps represents a forecast of what Wesleyan is to become. I love this place. To the very fiber of my being, I do. There has not been a day when I have not thought about how it felt to be a member of the family there. Foss, Olin, the particular smell of Butterfield A, raging silently in a crowd of ecstatic young people, late nights in PAC – these are all things that I will take with me wherever I go.  And so, it is with a heavy heart that I implore you, whoever you are, to remember why you are part of this community, and what you want from this community. Keep talking. Don’t shut down the conversation. You deserve a real conversation. The great comic Louis CK once said (to Jon Stewart, no less) that “all conversation is good conversation.” I’ve been reading the comments section on Wesleying, and you know what? I think they’re great, even the abundance of cynical ones. Like that one Wes grad who wrote, passionately, “Bottom line, Wesleyan kids need to realize that stomping your feet does not get you what you want like it did when you were a kid. The world is not fair sometimes.” Or that other one from another Wes grad, who wrote: “I donated two days ago. And I don’t regret my decision.” They are points of view, they are perspectives, and I think it’s completely cool that you folks hold them. But they are not arguments, and they are words that end real conversations. Please, speak more. Tell us why you don’t regret your decision. Tell us why you think the world isn’t fair sometimes, and why we should accept that. If there’s one academic thing I ever learned from my time at Wesleyan (via Professor Richard Adelstein), it’s that we’re always working with imperfect information. Heck, while I was writing this, I just found out from another alum that spending on flat-screen TVs is miniscule compared to the rest of the budget. Because we’re working with individual limitations, we need to work together. We need to collaborate, we need to keep working through this together, and most of all, we need to respect one another. Once again, I implore you: remember why you are part of this community, and what you want this community to be. I will not lie to you – there is a chance that you will fail. There is a chance that at the end of the day, you will have to either give up on our ideals or fold as an institution (unrealistic as that might be). But if you do fail, it will not be for a lack of trying. It will not be because you never gave yourselves a chance. Whatever, I’m still pretty optimistic. You can find a way. You just need to keep looking, and to do that, you have to keep talking. Good luck. I know you can do it.   xoxo Nicholas Quah ’12/frostedmoose. PS: I usually like being anonymous. I like not getting phone calls, not being reduced as a person to a single argument, and I like being able to change my mind on things (but not on a Romney-level). But I think this is something I should stand up on. Other alums, if you’re reading this, please stand up too. I t’s not like they can write us up, AMIRIGHT??   tl;dr – (1) Please keep talking, and (2) I’ll donate when Wesleyan earns my donation. Until then, Ira Glass and NPR will get my cash money."
"Interfaith House To Be Replaced Next Year","2012-10-31","by Christina Norris, Assistant News Editor","Interfaith House, formerly located on the first floor of 230 Washington St., has been disbanded due to a lack of student interest in the program. Administrators, along with student members of the Undergraduate Residential Life Committee (URLC), which is composed of ResLife staff and Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) members, are in the process of deciding what to do with the space. According to WSA Student Affairs Committee Chair and URLC co-chair Nicole Updegrove ’14, the decision to do away with Interfaith House was made last year after two semesters of low student interest in living in the house. “Every semester, Area Coordinators evaluate program houses based on a series of criteria including number of beds filled by interested students (not boarders), number of programs conducted, and general engagement of the house members in house activities,” Updegrove wrote in an email to The Argus. “Houses must earn a passing number of points to remain in good standing; if they miss the mark two out of three consecutive semesters, the house is brought to the University Residential Life Committee for review of its viability.” Currently, Lighthouse residents as well as boarders are occupying the house. Lighthouse is located on the second floor of 230 Washington. The primary goal of the URLC right now is to fill the house in a way that is most beneficial to the University community. At the moment, several options are being considered, including transfer of an existing program house. “Res Life is in the process of reviewing the needs of several current program houses to see if relocation of any existing programs would make sense,” wrote Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Whaley in an email to The Argus. If the URLC along with administrators decide to relocate a program, no new program will be created. However, if they decide to explore options for a new program house, then students will have the opportunity to apply for the use of the space by a program of their creation. It will then be up to the URLC to review all applications and vote for the best option. Some student groups have already expressed interest in the space, which consists of a lounge, a kitchen, a laundry room, and seven bedrooms, including four doubles and three singles. Rho Epsilon Pi (Rho Ep) and Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) hope to apply to jointly share the space. “We feel that this co-educational housing experience presents a unique opportunity to chart a new, progressive course for Greek life at Wesleyan,” Rho Ep President Melody Oliphant ’13 wrote in an email to The Argus. Rho Ep members have entertained the idea of acquiring a house since the Wesleyan chapter of the sorority was founded in March of 2011. Oliphant explained that she sees the idea of sharing the space with AEPi as an opportunity to challenge stereotypes of Greek societies at the University. “I’ve often heard the expressed viewpoint at Wesleyan and other peer institutions that housed Greek societies present as antithetical to a progressive liberal arts education,” Oliphant wrote. “We feel that its important to combat such pigeonholed stereotypes about Greek societies. A co-ed house presents that valuable chance to live and learn together while still maintaining autonomy and building meaningful communities on campus for students.” In April of 2011, President Michael Roth stated that he would not be in favor of adding single-sex Greek housing on campus, but he did not specify whether he would be opposed to the creation of a new co-ed Greek house. If Rho Ep and AEPi are given the opportunity to apply for the creation of a new program house, such an application will be considered by the URLC. However, if Roth decides not to allow for the expansion of Greek housing, the application cannot ultimately be approved. Though the members of Rho Ep and AEPi are hopeful, Whaley has expressed the administration’s current feelings clearly. “President Roth has made clear that we intend to continue supporting the existing residential Greek organizations, but that we will not create additional Greek houses,” Whaley wrote. “Students can, of course, freely participate in any of a number of other Greek organizations that do not have houses at Wesleyan.” Members of Rho Ep and AEPi will meet with Roth in the coming weeks to discuss the idea of creating a co-ed program house for their organizations."
"Student Political Groups Battle Voting Apathy","2012-11-01","by Alexandra Ozols, Staff Writer","As the Nov. 6 Election Day approaches, campus political groups have been working to ignite a democratic spark in the student body. Given the University’s reputation as an activist campus, some of the students who are working the hardest for student political engagement expressed their disappointment with the level of student interest during an election cycle that includes a close presidential contest as well as close senatorial races. “There’s a sense that reading the news and watching the debates constitute political engagement,” Wesleyan Democrats (WesDems) president Michael Linden ’15 said. “But there’s more to do.” Linden said that he perceives a sense of apathy on the part of college students in general and in University students in particular. “Disillusionment of college students [with the political process] stems from a general sense that their vote doesn’t matter,” he said. “Even though their vote is probably not going to be the deciding vote, exercising it is still a meaningful act of civic engagement.” In response to the perceived apathy, the WesDems have spent most of the last six weeks conducting a series of “dorm storms,” mostly in freshman housing. Linden said those efforts netted between 100 and 200 new student voter registrations in Middletown. Linden said his organization focused its voter registration drive on Connecticut residents and out-of-state students who had never registered in their home states. “Student-to-student outreach is very effective,” he said. Linden noted that such outreach could be critical in Connecticut, where there is a competitive Senate race between Democratic Representative of the 5th Congressional District Chris Murphy and the Republican candidate former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, who ran against Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal in the 2010 election. “I understand being disillusioned with Obama, but what the gridlock in Washington has taught us is that down ballot races have a real impact,” Linden said. “While I think a lot of students say, ‘The two-party system isn’t for me,’ it’s a reality, and there’s a very clear dichotomy between the two parties.” Wesleyan for Warren campus organizer Sam Ebb ’13 agrees. His group has rallied students in support of Democrat Elizabeth Warren, who is challenging Republican incumbent Scott Brown in the Massachusetts senatorial contest. Ebb said he believes Warren’s positions resonate with the progressive University student body. He cited the Harvard professor’s economic policies and her role in creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau for the Obama administration. “Also, Brown’s co-sponsorship of the Blunt Amendment and vote against equal pay for equal work should be big sticking points for members of the Wesleyan community,” Ebb said. During this semester, the 15-20 students actively involved in the Wesleyan for Warren organization—including its six interns, some of whom had worked for the campaign during the summer—conducted an absentee ballot drive and ran weekly phone banks to connect with undecided and independent voters in Massachusetts. Several of the core members also spent a few weekends canvassing in Worcester, Mass., for their candidate. According to Ebb, the organization also supported WesDems’ efforts on behalf of Connecticut candidate Murphy. “Most people at Wesleyan are going to support Obama and Murphy,” Linden said. “It’s just a matter of whether they’re going to get out and vote.” Democracy Matters, a non-partisan national student organization, emphasizes college student participation in elections. President of the University’s chapter of Democracy Matters Alyssa Bonneau ’14 expressed support for the need to encourage even politically astute students to exercise the franchise. “You come to Wesleyan and have expectations for an activist campus, but we’re not as politically active as people think we are,” Bonneau said. “Compared to other places, people do intend to vote.” Bonneau said that, while her group is very small, it has been working with the WesDems to urge students to make a plan to vote. “The most important thing is to create an atmosphere of excitement and to try to remind people that this is an historic event,” she said. As part of its get-out-the-vote effort, Democracy Matters has arranged for free coffee for any student who brings in a mug to the Red and Black Café and presents hir voting sticker. The recently founded Students for a Free Society has chosen not to endorse any political candidate, nor has it engaged in any election campaigning. “Students for a Free Society has attracted people who, for the most part, reject the liberal-conservative dichotomy,” said the group’s founder and president Charlie Smith ’15. According to Smith, the new group is composed of libertarians, anarchists, conservatives, communists, and left-wingers. “Many people feel disillusioned with the two main parties and generally tend to be skeptical of government,” Smith said. “Some people in the group may not vote because they don’t want to have to pick the lesser of two evils. We would rather try to educate people and change their views than ask them to make a vote that isn’t necessarily an educated one.” Monica Sheridan ’15, a former member of Wesleyan Republicans, said she is not interested in resurrecting the group, which is now listed as inactive on the Wesleyan Student Assembly webpage. She described most campus Republicans as fiscal conservatives with generally libertarian views on social issues who can be integrated into the new Students for a Free Society. In contrast to 2011, when University students voted at five different polling sites, this year students registered at their campus address will vote at one of two polling stations. Because of redistricting, the vast majority will vote at the senior center located across from Broad Street Books, and those living north of Washington Street will vote at the Macdonough Elementary School. Shuttles will ferry students from Usdan to the two polling sites every 10 minutes on Election Day, Nov. 6."
"Rowling Vacates Hogwarts for Successful Novel for Adults","2012-11-08","by Rebecca Seidel, Assistant Features Editor","For a story rooted in a tiny bubble of a town, “The Casual Vacancy” covers an astonishing amount of territory. J.K. Rowling’s new novel grapples with everything from socioeconomic clashes to petty small-town politics, with ample doses of teenage angst and family woes. The story ventures into the minds of countless characters, exposing trenches of questionable motives, failed communication, and unrequited longing. But if you want to know about all that, you’ll read the 500 pages yourself. I’m here to answer the real question people have, whether they plan on opening the book or not: how does “The Casual Vacancy” compare to the Harry Potter series? Here’s the short answer—it doesn’t.  And I mean that in the best way possible. In some ways, “The Casual Vacancy” is the antithesis of “Harry Potter.” Harry’s story unfolds in a world that is entirely Rowling’s creation, a society built on magical foundations. “The Casual Vacancy” is rooted in a world that is resolutely normal and all too familiar. The book’s greatest appeal is that it delves so deeply into this mundane Muggle society, uncovering layers of conflict in a story that is rather unremarkable on the surface. The plot kicks off with the sudden death of Barry Fairbrother, a resident of the fictional town of Pagford in southwestern England. His death leaves an empty seat on the Pagford Parish Council, the political powerhouse of the town. The general grief over Barry’s passing gets buried in a bigger question: who will fill the vacancy? In the battle that ensues over the Council seat, the main source of contention is The Fields, an area of public housing projects that also houses a drug rehabilitation clinic. The Fields are technically a part of Pagford, but some members of the Pagford Council are determined to give up responsibility for the area, feeling that its persistent poverty and negative reputation should be totally severed from the idyllic Pagford community. Barry Fairbrother was in favor of keeping The Fields a part of Pagford, rather than handing it over to the neighboring city of Yarvil. But in his absence, the head honchos of the Pagford Council are determined to override the pro-Fields contingent. The decision depends on who gets elected to replace Barry. The novel’s central conflict isn’t especially gripping. It’s the story’s implications—the ever-present problem of class warfare, the question of who should take responsibility for whom—that make “The Casual Vacancy” a culturally relevant and compelling read. Caught up in this struggle is Krystal Weedon, a teenage Fields resident whose foul mouth and reputation for indiscretion disgust many Pagford residents. While she seems like just a waste of space at first, we soon find out how complex and sad her story is. She essentially has to raise her little brother while her single mother continually fails to quit her heroin habit. If the anti-Fields people had their way, the local methadone clinic would close down, making her situation worse than ever. Krystal’s story is the most tragic one in the book. Her problems pose a stark contrast to the petty preoccupations of Pagford’s more affluent residents. The members of the Mollison family, who lead the anti-Fields regiment, are unsurprisingly on the opposite end of this spectrum from Krystal. By constantly shifting perspectives, advancing the story through the eyes and minds of all of her characters equally, Rowling makes this contrast all the more apparent. It would take way too long to go through this novel’s entire cast of characters. So many people factor into the novel’s plot that their interconnecting storylines are at times hard to keep up with. Rowling makes an admirable effort to get inside each of her characters’ minds, exposing attitudes and flaws that go beyond appearances. Sometimes she goes overboard or misses the mark, but the characters are generally believable. The one thing they all have in common is that they are all somehow unsatisfied with their own lives, whether they are unhappy in their romantic engagements, lusting after people they can’t have, or struggling with self-consciousness. Unfortunately, this dissatisfaction is the unifying factor that makes them so relatable. There are only a few truly likable characters, but that’s to be expected when you’re taking such extensive trips inside each of these people’s heads. Rowling is really in her element when she delves into the lives of Pagford’s younger residents. The kids play an indirect but crucial role in the outcome of the town’s elections. But they also are involved in their own sub-plots—stories of insecurity, frustration, and sexual curiosity that are convincing without being contrived. Their narratives often provide a refreshing break from the adults’ melodramatic woes. That being said, this book is decidedly not for children.  Its content is raw and often sexually explicit, and it deals with cases of self-harm, child abuse, drug addiction, and rape. Parents of young Harry Potter fanatics should take heed. In an interview with The New Yorker, Rowling said that the idea to write about a local election came to her on an airplane trip, in a “rush of adrenaline.” It’s a bit difficult to understand how small-town politics could inspire such excitement, and I found it hard at times to sustain attention on an issue that was fundamentally not that interesting. But Rowling’s psychological exploration of her characters makes up for the places in which the story itself is lacking. Though this novel definitely has its funny moments, it is by no means an uplifting book. If you’re prepared for a dose of disillusionment, “The Casual Vacancy” is worth a read."
"University Will Not Relocate Bookstore","2012-12-06","by Daniel Greenberg, News Editor","In response to firm opposition by members of the Middletown and Wesleyan communities, the University has decided not to relocate its bookstore to the Washington Street site proposed by the Middletown real estate company Centerplan Companies. President Michael Roth announced this decision at the faculty meeting on Tuesday, Dec. 4. The next day, Associate Vice President for Finance Nathan Peters and Associate Vice President for Facilities Joyce Topshe sent out an all-campus email to announce the decision and the reasoning behind it. “On the basis of strong community sentiment, Wesleyan has decided not to relocate its bookstore to Washington Street,” wrote Peters and Topshe. “Objections to the bookstore relocation (and planned development) included concerns about pedestrian safety, increased traffic, and disruption of the residential neighborhood.” Centerplan’s proposal to include the University bookstore in a three-story complex had been met with considerable criticism. Some of the more common critiques included the dangers of crossing the very busy Washington Street and concern about the negative effects of introducing national chains into Middletown. The University’s decision pleased those who opposed the relocation, including Red and Black Café Owner Ed Thorndike ’89, whose café might have been closed if the bookstore had moved. “Obviously we are pleased with the decision and not too surprised,” wrote Thorndike in an email to The Argus. “We hope Centerplan withdraws their plan for a scaled down development. As so many people in the Wes community have argued, it’s a terrible location for such a development.” Many other students and faculty approved of the University’s decision not to go forward with the relocation proposal. “I’ve been opposed to the project for a while now,” said Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) Finance and Facilities Committee Chair Andrew Trexler ’14. “The Middletown community and the Wesleyan community have generally been in opposition to it, and it would be damaging to town-gown relations if Wesleyan went ahead with the project without the Middletown community’s support.” At the forum, Centerplan CEO Robert Landino said that even if the University decided not to move the bookstore, the development on Washington Street might still go into construction. “We probably would go forward with a two-floor building, not a three-floor building, that would include a first floor of retail and a second floor of our offices,” said Landino. Despite the University’s decision, Wesleyan remains under contract with Centerplan to sell one of the Washington Street properties that will comprise the new site. “Wesleyan is still under contract to sell one of the four properties to [Centerplan],” Trexler said. “It’s a piece of property that [the University has] been trying to sell for some time. We didn’t offer them anything, it’s just been on the market, and they have a contract to buy it. We could try to pull out of the contract, but there are certain legal implications for that, but there has been some talk about [doing that] among Wesleyan and the Middletown community.” Though the idea of relocating the bookstore to Washington Street faced heavy criticism, several people have advocated different improvements to the bookstore. “We do think this is a good opportunity for the University to re-examine the bookstore,” wrote Thorndike. “The business of selling books is rapidly changing, and we should bring all the stakeholders (students, faculty, administration, local community, Follett, and Red & Black Café) together to discuss where the store is headed and what, if any, changes should be made.”"
"Wesleyan Participates in WEServe Week of Service","2013-01-28","by Millie Dent, Contributing Writer","In honor of the National Day of Service and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the University hosted a WEServe Week of Service. University students, alumni, friends, and family were invited to participate in acts of community service all across the world. The driving force behind this operation was Associate Director of Alumni Parent Events and Director of Reunion Programs Makaela Kingsley. Kingsley said that she recognized that because so many University alumni are already involved in community service, the University should facilitate the combining of alumni efforts. “The concept was uniquely translatable to geographic areas of all sizes; unlike some of our events which require a critical mass to be successful, these community service projects could engage alumni, parents, and students in cities or towns with as few as one or two Wesleyan people,” Kingsley wrote in an email to The Argus. The project began in November, when people began serving as Project Captains. In exchange for Captains organizing an event, the University agreed to help advertise the event in an effort to involve as many alumni as possible. Kingsley created a website that aggregated the various community service events taking place and allowed people to sign up for them. “By the first week in January, we had 39 projects on the WEServe calendar, and we used these same channels to advertise the projects and seek registrants until the Jan. 16 sign-up deadline,” Kingsley wrote. Projects were organized all over the United States, as well as in Greece and Nicaragua. Project Captains graduated in years ranging from the Class of ’55 to the Class of ’14. Sofia Warren ’13 assisted as Student Coordinator of Publicity for WEServe. Although she joined the staff only a week prior to the events, Kingsley credits Warren for her assistance. “A lot of [the volunteers] are going to soup kitchens or reading to children or [participating in events] more conventionally thought of as service work, but there’s also some that are more out of the box, which is really nice, because people have adapted things that they’re already doing to kind of think about it in different ways,” Warren said. One notable event, which took place in Boston, involved COMPASS for kids, an organization that works to improve children’s education. Alumni helped brainstorm ideas for a social media plan for the organization. An event in Middletown involved the Wesleyan Alliance for Generational Exchange (WesAGE), which goes to One Macdonough Place, an assisted living home, every Friday to foster relationships between University students and residents of the home. Although the event occurs weekly, the social hour was posted on the WEServe website, encouraging more people to attend and to spread awareness about the group. At One Macdonough Place, students played dominoes and bridge with residents and were served homemade cake and eggnog. Genelle Faulkner ’13 said she was encouraged to attend the event after talking to Shane Donahue ’14, who served as the Project Captain of the event. Approximately eight other Wesleyan students attended the event. “I really liked how easy it was to just talk to people or start a game of dominoes,” Faulkner wrote in an email to The Argus. “My favorite part was when [a resident] had Sofia and I searching the room for all her artwork, so that she could look at them again and talk about them. She was so happy to share her work with us, and they were really good. I was happy to be someone she could share her art with.” Kingsley wrote that WEServe was a success and that she plans to make it an annual event. The Office of Alumni and Parent Engagement and Events also supports community service events throughout the year. “My goals for next year will be to line up projects in other areas (Asia, the Midwest, Texas, New England, and more), recruit more undergraduate Project Captains, and expand the diversity of community service opportunities,” Kingsley wrote. “In particular, I’d like to see Wesleyan people use their professional expertise to ‘do good’ in their home communities.” Next year, Kingsley said that WEServe plans to double the number of projects that were done this year and to inspire more alumni and friends to participate."
"“Exclusion and Its Consequences:” dead prez Comes to Wesleyan","2013-01-28","by Adam Keller, Features Editor","On Saturday, Jan. 26, hip-hop heads and education-minded students were treated to “Education and Its Consequences Part 2: Bigger Than Hip- Hop.” Among others, the panel featured Mutulu Olugbala and Khnum Muata Ibomu, better known as M-1 and stic.man, of the legendary political rap group dead prez. Alongside them were Umi, an affiliated rapper and alumnus of the Class of ’99; Assistant Professor of Sociology Daniel Long; and Chantaneice Kitt ’13. Evan Okun ’13 introduced the panel by screening the music video for dead prez’s “They Schools,” mentioning that bringing the group to campus has been a dream of his since freshman year. Okun said that the impetus for the panel came last spring. “Nick Petrie ’12 invited me to the ‘Left Forum’ in NYC,” he said. “I went to a couple panels featuring M1 and Umi. Afterward I was talking with them and we vibed well, so I mentioned that I’d be interested in hosting a panel/concert at my school, at which point Umi and I realized it was his alma mater.” A number of co-sponsors, including Writers’ Bloc, Ujamaa, the Office of Student Activities and Leadership Development, and WeSlam, assembled funding for the panel and subsequent concert, but the two largest sponsors were the Student Budget Committee and the Sociology Department. “I think part of the reason the Sociology Department was willing to invest was because I take my classes very seriously here, and this panel was the ‘action component’ of my senior essay,” Okun said. Right off the bat, it was clear that the panel would not focus on smaller education policy issues, but rather would deconstruct the current educational institutions in America as promoters of stratification and would advocate for self-determined mindfulness in our engagement with the world. Ibomu responded to Okun’s first question on educational reform by rejecting the entire premise of institutionalized schooling and comparing systems of education to a domesticated dog’s upbringing. “When you put education in a system, it’s already dead,” Ibomu said. “There’s a difference between being trained to do something and being educated. If you see a dog that knows his master’s habits, you say, ‘That’s a smart dog.’ But if you sit that dog outside and say, ‘Be a dog,’ he says, ‘Where’s the lasagna?’” Dead prez maintained that education should prioritize sociological understanding and empathy over subjects like math, science, and English. The panelists said that on an individual level, people can achieve these aims through things like mindfulness and Buddhist philosophy, but Olugbala argued that revolutionary education is possible on an organizational level, citing schools in Tuscon, Ariz. and Oakland, Calif. as short-lived examples of positive change. Also on the panel was Long, who discussed his experiences working as an educator in low-income areas and how it affirmed for him the current system’s reproduction of existing inequalities. He explained that the necessity of a college degree to succeed professionally means that community service programs sponsored by elite colleges often function in a paternalistic manner, thus actually reinforcing income inequality. Okun further explained this phenomenon. “Having labeled ourselves [as] enlightened, us college students ‘grace’ underprivileged communities with the knowledge we have been given,” he said. Okun further argued that for a Wesleyan education to be progressive, it needs to motivate its students to go above and beyond typical service programs. “M1, Stic, and Umi suggested that much could be learned from interacting with the Middletown residents outside the paternalistic bounds of a ‘helping’ relationship,” he said. The forum members suggested that it is possible for a Wesleyan education to cultivate mindfulness, despite the nature of the system to which it belongs. Umi cited his time at Wesleyan as a positive and expansive chapter in his life, and Okun maintained that the potential exists, albeit in small quantities. “This would depend on people taking the reality that we are egocentric, paternalistic beings seriously,” Okun said. “Our university should support more classes that cultivate this awareness. It does currently to some degree (e.g., Introduction to Buddhism and Paternalism and Social Power), but not enough.”"
"Committee on Nominations Selects Candidates for Trustees","2013-01-31","by Aria Danaparamita, Contributing Writer","The Committee on Nominations for the Board of Trustees selected candidates for the alumni-elected trustee positions for 2014 last weekend. Vice President for University Relations Barbara-Jan Wilson stated that the names will be announced in the coming days. Seniors will also be eligible to vote on the nominees later this semester. On Saturday, Jan. 26, the chair of the Alumni Association, the Committee on Nominations, and staff from University Relations met at Usdan to finalize the ballot for the upcoming election. They chose six candidates from a pool of 40 nominees. Senior Wesleyan Annual Gift (SWAG) Intern Daniele Packard ’13 said that continued alumni engagement with the University is vital. “Your voice doesn’t end after you graduate,” he said. “You still have a voice; you’re still part of Wesleyan beyond your four years.” Each year, Wesleyan alumni and the senior class elect three alumni to serve on the University’s Board of Trustees for three-year terms. Nine alumni-elected trustees, nearly a third of the Board, serve at any given time. The Board is composed of elected and ex-officio trustees. The University Charter of 1907 stipulates that a majority of the elected trustees must be graduates of the University. The Board’s rights and duties include: to ordain and enact by-laws, ordinances, and regulations; to elect the president of the University; to set salaries and terms of employment of the president, faculty, and officers; and to remove from office any member of the faculty and employee of the University. All alumni and current seniors are eligible to vote in the election. Voting opens in mid-April and closes at 5 p.m. on Sunday, May 26, during Reunion and Commencement Weekend. “I had no idea the senior class had a vote in electing new trustees,” Claire Dougherty ’13 said. “Do seniors know that they can vote and do they exercise it? Were we ever told or were we just supposed to find out?” Committee Chair Susan Sutherland ’82 invited the alumni community to forward suggestions for candidature, including via an online form on Wesconnect, an alumni outreach website. Those submitting nominations are asked to consider the nominee’s contributions to the University as well as hir personal and professional achievements. “Each year’s process formally begins the fall prior to the election when a subcommittee of alumni and staff meet in order to narrow down the pool of nominated alumni,” Wilson and Assistant Director of Alumni and Parent Programs Adriana Rojas wrote in a joint email to The Argus. Nominations are always accepted, Wilson and Rojas confirmed, though nominees may decline an invitation. “Following that meeting, the alumni who are selected are invited to submit information, including an essay and updated bio, to be considered by the Committee on Nominations,” they wrote. Sutherland presided over Saturday’s meeting. She began with a discussion about the goals for alumni-elected trustees. Following the conversation, potential candidates were reviewed one at a time. Once all candidates were reviewed, members of the Committee voted for the slated six. The six on the ballot must include three who are 21-or-more years past graduation and three who are 20-or-fewer years past graduation. The alumni-elected position is essential to democratic representation, students claim. “It’s important that alumni always have a voice in establishing who gets a say in important decisions,” SWAG Intern and Red and Black Calling Society Manager Melody Oliphant ’13 stated. The Board of Trustees is consulted for major decisions regarding the University, including, most controversially, the recent decision to end need-blind admissions. “When students think about the Board of Trustees right now, they think about need-blind,” Oliphant said. Many students expressed that alumni-elected representatives can bring an important voice to the discourse. “I think the Board of Trustees is overrepresented by those of remarkable financial means, which is not necessarily representative of the alumni population,” Anwar Batte ’13 posited. Joyce Y. Hall ’78, Bradley Whitford ’81 and Miguel A. Guadalupe ’98 were voted alumni-elected trustees in the past election cycle."
"CCP Launches Campaign to Highlight Town-Gown Collaborations","2013-02-04","by Michelle Li, Contributing Writer","Even within the University bubble, students are often unaware of the institutional practices around them; buildings get constructed, lightbulbs get changed, toilets get plunged, and nobody really knows how. Beginning Tuesday, Feb. 5, the Center for Community Partnerships (CCP) will launch a new campaign  titled, “Did You Know?” which is aimed at raising awareness of the partnerships connecting the University and Middletown. Some students feel that they could benefit from learning more about the University’s relations with Middletown. “I think Wesleyan students would participate in more civic engagement if they knew more about what’s going on,” Jessica Seidman ’16 said. “Wesleyan feels kind of like a separate community from Middletown.” Heading the campaign are Civic Engagement Fellow for the Center for Community Partnerships Dana Pellegrino ’12 and Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Cathy Lechowicz. Pellegrino explained that the campaign will feature twice-weekly sound bites giving facts on relations between Middletown and the University. The Service-Learning Center, the Office of Community Service and Volunteerism, and the Office of Community Relations are three branches of the CCP, the umbrella group of offices that works on University-community initiatives. In addition, several student groups, such as Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO), Wesleyan Alliance for Generational Exchange (WesAGE), Woodrow Wilson Tutoring, and Housing and Hunger, as well as service-learning classes, are also part of the Center. The resources of the CCP are available to students interested in civic engagement. According to Pellegrino, the pieces of information that “Did You Know?” publishes will come from University offices and student groups. The project will rely strongly on student feedback. The Office of Community Service (OCS), in addition to offering students the opportunity to secure work-study positions, allows some student groups the chance to help out in projects such as the “Did You Know?” campaign. Lechowicz said that students will have the opportunity to contribute to posts of the “Did You Know?” Campaign. The sound bites will be posted Tuesdays and Thursdays on various social media outlets, among which are Twitter @wes_engage, the OCS Facebook page, the webpage of the CCP, and the Middletown Eye, a blog managed by Middletown residents. Despite the many media outlets the campaign will be utilizing, not all students are optimistic that the project will meet its intended goals. Although Seidman indicated interest in learning more about partnerships between Middletown and the University, Maria Massad ’16 expressed some doubts about the campaign. “I think increasing Middletown-University relations is a noble cause, but I think people should be integrated into the community through events and not blogs,” Massad said. Both Pellegrino and Lechowicz emphasized that the campaign’s main focus is on raising awareness of town-gown partnerships. “This is not sugarcoat[ing] about engagement,” Lechowicz said. Pellegrino additionally notes that that the campaign is not intended to make students feel that the University is improving Middletown; rather, the sound bites will showcase occasions of equal partnership between the University and the town. “It’s about sharing the little things that go on that people may not know about,” Lechowicz said."
"Hear More, See More: MiddletownRemix Maps Sonic Landscape","2013-02-07","by Rebecca Seidel, Assistant Features Editor","The relentlessly beeping traffic light on Washington Street, the howl of a siren on Church, the booming voice of a poet at the Buttonwood Tree—Middletown has its own acoustic identity, accessible to anyone who pauses to listen. MiddletownRemix, an ongoing collaborative project sponsored by the Center for the Arts (CFA), seeks to engage the community in exploring, mapping out, and reimagining the sounds that build and surround it. MiddletownRemix derives from a larger project called UrbanRemix, which was created by three professors at the Georgia Institute of Technology—Jason Freeman, Michael Nitsche, and Carl Disalvo—who wanted a unique way to facilitate the public’s engagement with the sounds of its community. “Participants in the UrbanRemix workshops become active creators of shared soundscapes as they search the city for interesting sound cues,” reads their website. “The collected sounds, voices, and noises provide the original tracks for musical remixes that reflect the specific nature and acoustic identity of the community.” MiddletownRemix uses the web platform generated by the creators of UrbanRemix to allow anyone in the area to explore these concepts for themselves and contribute to the project’s online sonic database. Participants download a phone app (available on the Music and Public Life section of the CFA’s website) that allows them to record sounds they hear in Middletown and then upload them to the collection. A visit to the MiddletownRemix website will bring you to a map of Middletown that is sprinkled with pinpointed locations. If you click on any of these flagged spots, you will hear a sample of a sound that was recorded there. You can also see who uploaded the sound, any tags the uploader chose to attach to the sound, and other relevant details. The web platform allows you to trace a path of your choice over the map by clicking on a series of points, leading you to hear all the sounds that have been recorded along your makeshift route. By syncing these sounds, creating loops, and controlling volume and other factors—all of which you can do on this webpage—you can create a mix based on the available sounds. MiddletownRemix is part of the CFA’s Music and Public Life initiative, a year-long effort to explore and appreciate the role music plays in communities. CFA Program Manager Erinn Roos-Brown remarked that MiddletownRemix is a perfect platform for harnessing this concept in a participatory way. “Most of Music and Public Life consists of lectures and performances,” Roos-Brown said. “It’s great stuff, but nothing that you or I as audience members can grasp or feel like we’re really a part of. [MiddletownRemix is] a way of making it accessible.” Roos-Brown added that University Professor of Music Ron Kuivila and Assistant Professor of Music Paula Matthusen were instrumental in bringing UrbanRemix to Middletown. “When we found out about the Music and Public Life initiative, this seemed like it would be something interesting for them,” Matthusen said. “What we were interested in doing here was something that was a longer duration of Music and Public Life, something that would last for a longer period of time.” Matthusen found out about UrbanRemix through research she was doing on soundscapes. “I’d always known Jason [Freeman]’s work because he’s done a lot of work related to how audiences interact with performers, and these different ways of making and sharing sounds,” she said. “A lot of his work has examined this John Cage-type triumvirate of ‘performer-composer-listener’…he’s very interested in making a kind of loop where those roles get mixed around.” Most of MiddletownRemix is funded by a grant from Connecticut’s Department of Economic and Community Development, through a pilot program called Arts Catalyze Placemaking. “It’s all about connecting the arts to economic development through community-building,” Roos-Brown said. “You couldn’t have asked for a more perfect program [for this project].” Sure enough, the Middletown- Remix project is seeking to engage the community in an event whose scope extends beyond the UrbanRemix platform. On May 11, the project will culminate in a community-wide festival in the North End Arts District on Main Street. The event will incorporate many local organizations and projects and will feature various sound installations, live mixing, and a flash mob, among other things. In addition to commissioning local artists for various installations, this festival will draw on work from both Wesleyan and Middletown public school students. The CFA is currently holding a competition for Wesleyan student DJs; after a public voting period, the four winning DJs will be commissioned by the CFA to create a 15-minute remix to be played during the festival in May, incorporating sounds from the MiddletownRemix project. Students who wish to enter the competition must submit a two to three minute remix that incorporates sounds from the MiddletownRemix project by March 3. Roos-Brown spoke of the situation as ideal for both applicants and voters. “Wesleyan students get to pick what they like, those students get to play downtown, and we get to pay them for their work,” she said. The project has also sought the input of DJs from the Middletown area. Arun Ranganathan, a DJ of hip-hop and urban music who resides in Middletown, explained that he will be mixing live at the festival in May, using sounds uploaded to the MiddletownRemix website. “I’ll probably include samples from other places musically, but I’m going to base it thematically around the samples that I get from the MiddletownRemix site,” he said. “I’ve already had a couple of ideas…I don’t really want to expand on it too much yet, but there are certain themes there that really fit together.” Aletta Brady ’15, the CFA’s Music and Public Life Intern, explained that last semester, the CFA focused primarily on engaging the greater Middletown community with the project. “The fall was a lot of promoting the sounds, making sure that people are remixing, especially in the Middletown community and among the public school students,” Brady said. Brady added that many local organizations have been very receptive to the idea of MiddletownRemix and are eager to participate. “When I went around the area to speak with organizations and ask if they wanted to partner with us, they were really excited,” she said. The CFA hopes to draw more Wesleyan students into participating in the project and the upcoming festival. Matthusen’s Laptop Ensemble class is already set to perform at the event: the class will be premiering a piece by UrbanRemix founder Jason Freeman. “It’s about 15 minutes long, and it has set rules of how he wants it to start and end, but there’s a lot of freedom within that,” Matthusen explained. “What happens is that when we’re playing with each other, we make patterns on the spot, and the audience can see us do this. One member within the ensemble can then grab a pattern from someone else, because everyone’s networked, and then use that as a way of generating and transforming the sound.” Matthusen added that Middletown- Remix as a whole provides an interesting platform for connecting people with the sounds they hear. “It was so fun to hear things that other people recorded that they found interesting and to have that moment of overlap,” she said. “It’s a way of mapping that we are here and putting together a sonic collage of where we are…hopefully we will use this moment to engage with the larger community, because there’s so much to Middletown—there’s a lot of possibility here.” CFA Institute for Curatorial Practice in Performance Intern Monica Tinyo ’13 also thinks that MiddletownRemix will bring people together. Specifically, she hopes the project will help bridge some gaps between Wesleyan students and the Middletown community. “After last semester, with the diversity forum and everything like that, people were saying that we need a way to connect with people in Middletown,” she said. “The arts are such a good vehicle for that.”"
"Meditation Is Now a Laughing Matter","2013-02-18","by Rebecca Seidel, Assistant Features Editor","In the dim light of the Meditation Room in the basement of the Memorial Chapel, we lay in a circle on our backs, heads in the center. Aside from the ebb and flow of our breathing, the room was still and completely silent. Then somebody started giggling. It was Jenessa Duncombe ’14, the leader of this weekly meditation group. Her laughter rang through the room, provoked by nothing in particular. After a few seconds, this absurdity was too much to handle. Somebody else burst out laughing, and soon we were all pretty much convulsing on the floor. We laughed for 20 minutes straight—at each other’s laughter, at the situation in general, and at nothing at all. Sometimes it tapered off for a bit, but then somebody would break down again, and the entire room would dissolve into another fit of hysterics. This was the third session of Laughing Meditation, brought to the University this semester by the residents of Buddhist House. From 12:30 p.m. to 12:55 p.m. every Wednesday, students are invited to the Chapel’s Meditation Room for this weekly giggling gathering. Duncombe, a Buddhist House resident, thought that Laughing Meditation would be a valuable activity to bring to campus. “First off, it’s fun, and second off, it challenges what many people think of as ‘meditation,’” she said. “From a scientific standpoint, laughing releases endorphins and naturally lowers stress hormones. It also creates a sense of community in the room.” Laughing is indeed recognized in many circles as a therapeutic activity for both the body and mind, and Laughing Meditation is gaining ground as a practice. Some laughter-based meditations are more structured, incorporating stretches and breathing exercises, but the lunchtime meditation in the Chapel is primarily centered on mindful laughing. Duncombe noted that each meditation session so far has been unique. “The first time, I felt like the kid who the scary adult scolded for laughing inappropriately—‘No laughing! Be quiet!’—but I kept on laughing anyway,” she said. “The second time felt very light and relaxing, and the third time was full of energy and playfulness.” Energy and playfulness certainly dominated the most recent meditation. Although the occasional silence is allowed and embraced during Laughing Meditation, there was barely a second of stillness throughout the session; the laughing was contagious. It ended only when Duncombe’s phone alarm went off, signifying the end of the meditation—and even then, it was hard to stop giggling. The concept of Laughing Meditation may come as a surprise to those who think of meditation as a silent, introspective activity. It’s a far cry from Zen meditation, which generally involves sitting still, centering the mind, and focusing on breathing. Nonetheless, participants attest to the benefits of Laughing Meditation—many of which echo the benefits of more traditional types of meditation. “Zen meditation has always been really difficult for me, but laughing meditation is an easier way to access the same peacefulness,” Rachel Warren ’14 wrote in an email to The Argus. Warren has attended one Laughing Meditation thus far and found it an absorbing, joyful experience. “I have found that while doing it I am completely engaged, and engaged in the expression of joy,” she wrote. “There is no reason for laughter beyond the open expression of an existing and universal joy.” Leaders of Laughing Meditations emphasize the importance of full engagement in the practice. Dhyan Sutorius, a Dutch doctor who founded the Center for the Promotion of Laughter, spoke to this in an August 2009 interview with Ode Magazine. He noted the importance of mindfulness and acceptance when guiding participants through a Laughing Meditation session. “Every second of your attention should be directed to whatever presents itself to you at that moment, whatever it may be; laugh or cry with it, or be silent,” he said during the meditation session referenced in the article. “The essence is acceptance, letting go and being aware. The moment you totally accept the situation, the other person or yourself, you can laugh with it.” Duncombe echoed this sentiment, calling upon Sutorius’ instructions for inspiration. “Meditation is not a solitary, quiet act only to be achieved sitting cross-legged on the cushion,” she said. “I believe it is more of a way of being. Laughing Meditation also fits with our mission here at Buddhist house to be a spiritual presence on campus and to vary how we practice to in order to reach many types of people.”"
"Judith Butler Talks Zionism, Rhetoric","2013-02-18","by Adam Keller, Features Editor","Corey Sobotka/Assistant Photo Editor One of today’s most daring and divisive intellectuals recently graced campus with her presence. On Wednesday, Feb. 13, students packed Memorial Chapel to maximum capacity to hear Judith Butler speak. Butler, a post-structuralist philosopher who rose to fame in the early ’90s for her contributions to feminist and queer theory, provided what was for many an introduction to her studies in two other fields: Jewish philosophy and rhetoric. Butler delivered a lecture entitled “Martin Buber’s Two Zionisms and the Question of Palestine,” drawing on Buber’s 1948 essay to elucidate contemporary concerns over what she sees as the current Zionist project. The lecture addressed the implications of a Zionism based on ethics, as opposed to one based on the acquiescence of deserved goods, these models’ implementations throughout the history of modern-day Israel, and the roles the legacies of the Holocaust and anti-Semitism play in such considerations. Butler’s views on Judaism and Israel are hard to pin down conventionally without engaging with her theoretical work. She identifies as a member of the Jewish faith and attends the Kehilla Community Synagogue in Oakland, CA, but is strongly opposed to many aspects of contemporary Israel’s actions and has been variously identified as post-Zionist and anti-Zionist. However, Butler expressed reluctance to embrace labels. “I prefer to [provide] a story rather than a category,” Butler wrote in an email to The Argus. “I come from a strong zionist community in the [United States], and became critical of zionism starting in my early twenties….I am now working for what can only be called a post-zionist vision at this point in history. Perhaps at another point in history, I would be called a zionist, or even call myself that.” The lecture was organized and funded by the Center for the Humanities (CHUM) in conjunction with the Social, Cultural, and Critical Theory Certificate as part of the former’s Monday night lecture series and the latter’s “In Theory” lecture series. Yet Butler’s presence on campus was not restricted to Wednesday’s talk: she also facilitated a faculty workshop, participated in a video interview with President Michael Roth, and dined with several students from the humanities departments and the online journal PYXIS. The CHUM and Theory Certificate invited Butler to speak at Wesleyan following the controversies that arose after her reception of the Theodor W. Adorno Prize in 2012. Many protested the decision to grant Butler that honor given the content of her latest book, “Parting Ways: Jewishness and the Critique of Zionism.” According to Director of the CHUM Ethan Kleinberg, those criticisms seemed to warrant further discussion. “The members of the Theory Certificate and myself were talking about the ways that, in the criticism of Professor Butler’s stance, it was often the case that people would be criticizing her work as a theorist, or the language she used, or the thinkers she chooses to work on,” Kleinberg said. “We thought that was a weird conflation of the academic discussion and theorists as opposed to the political stance.” Kleinberg explained that this was the rationale for inviting Butler to speak. “We wanted to invite her here to give a talk so that we could engage with the intellectual and theoretical issues, and then also see how she moves from an engagement with these theorists to the political positions she holds,” he said. The themes Butler discussed will further inform an upcoming conference on German-American political theorist Hannah Arendt and next semester’s theme of “Justice and Judgment” at the CHUM. Butler’s appearance has gotten the ball rolling on a lot of the theoretical conversations to take place on campus in the coming months. “It wasn’t that we wanted to advocate for one position or another, but we thought this would be a great way of kick-starting some intense intellectual discussion on these issues,” Kleinberg said. Butler visited the University soon after her much-publicized appearance two weeks ago at Brooklyn College. There, she spoke alongside other activists who support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions campaign in a conference that brought about heated debate and calls to defund the school. Kleinberg stated that this timing threw Wednesday’s lecture into an interesting light, but didn’t otherwise affect its substance. “Obviously, [the Brooklyn College appearance] changed the complexion of her talk here, but that didn’t dissuade us from the necessity of allowing her to speak,” he said. Regarding the controversies surrounding her appearances, Butler welcomed opposing opinions. “I am always glad when people with a strong point of view feel that they can speak openly in public,” Butler wrote. “I [am] very much in favor of a robust public argument. I don’t need people to agree with me as much as I need them to engage in a serious and productive way.” Her post-lecture Q&A at Wesleyan had its own dissenting comments, most notably from Professor Emeritus of Biology William Firshein. Firshein argued that Israel’s military actions are largely justified by the threats posed by surrounding Arab countries. However, the overall atmosphere was of intense interest in Butler’s theoretical focus. Kleinberg mentioned that the student presence at Butler’s talk speaks to Wesleyan’s academic stature. “Any time you can get 500-plus of your student body to come listen to a high-level intellectual talk that has a bearing on contemporary political concerns…[it] is a very good sign for a university as a zone of intellectual engagement,” Kleinberg said. “It [bodes] very well for our student body, and for Wesleyan as a place where high-level discourse happens.” Butler, who pursued post-doctorate studies at the CHUM before teaching in the College of Letters for two years, seems to have a fondness for Wesleyan students’ enthusiasm for learning. “I have found it to be an impressive community in every way,” Butler said. “The students seem open, serious, and curious, and the faculty feel really lucky to be here.”"
"University Announces $400 Million “This is Why” Campaign","2013-02-18","by Lily Baggott, Christina Norris, News Editors","The University is kicking off the public phase of its latest fundraising campaign, the first phase of which began during the 2008 fiscal year. During the first phase, called a “quiet” or “nucleus” phase, administrators solicited donations from members of the University community and received over $270 million. The goal for the entire campaign, scheduled to last approximately eight years, is to raise $400 million. Over half of the money raised will go into the University’s endowment. The campaign’s theme, “This is Why,” is meant to encourage donors to think about why one might donate to the University. “Instead of us telling students, alumni, and parents why they should support the University, they should tell us why they care about Wesleyan,” said President Michael Roth. “They might say, ‘I don’t like what the administration’s doing, but this is why I love Wesleyan,’ or maybe, ‘Because I’m on the volleyball team, this is why I love Wesleyan.’ Someone else might say, ‘This is…because of the lab work I did,’ and someone else will say, ‘It’s because I met my spouse there.’ We don’t need to homogenize it into a single stream.” Manager of Media Relations and Public Relations Katherine Carlisle explained that while the bulk of the money raised will be put toward financial aid, many aspects of University operations will benefit from the donations. “It will help support recruiting faculty who are the best and the most talented, which is what we want to have working here,” Carlisle said. “[It will] also help support a lot of the programs that are very important to Wesleyan: the interdisciplinary programs, research funding, stipends for internships, and other types of student engagement which Wesleyan is known for.” Carlisle and Roth explained that when planning the campaign, administrators decided against some more standard approaches to fundraising. “When we started talking about this as a campaign, the issue that arose pretty quickly was that campaigns are marches, parades of people singing the same songs, wearing the same clothes,” Roth said. “This kind of doesn’t really work at Wesleyan. When we talked to our consultants about how to do this public phase…[they really thought] that Wesleyan would be better served by a campaign made by the constituents of the University rather than made by the administration or by a consultant.” In a search for a new style of fundraising, Roth explained, campaign planners decided on the “This is Why” theme in order to elicit vocal support from donors. “The support has been really encouraging,” Roth said. “There are people who are upset about need-blind. There are other people who are upset the football team hasn’t won enough games. There are lots of reasons not to give, but so many people are, in fact, supporting the University.” Roth said that the University has decided against having an expensive launch party or sending “glossy” pamphlets to potential donors. “It’s a little bit of an un-campaign,” Carlisle said. “It’s not traditionally the way a lot of our peer institutions have a somewhat more traditional approach to fundraising. This one has a lot more Wesleyan feel and appeal to it.” When donors give to the University, money goes either into the endowment, a long-term savings and investment vehicle, or the Wesleyan Fund, an annual fund used for more immediate needs. According to Editor and New Media Writer Lauren Rubenstein, this year’s goal for the Wesleyan Fund is $10.25 million. Of the money raised in this campaign, about $200 million, half of the $400 million fundraising goal, will be committed to financial aid, which will come either from the University’s endowment or the Wesleyan Fund. Another $140 million raised will come from endowment donations and be used to enlist faculty and foster distinct University programs. The remaining $60 million will be devoted to community engagement, internships, and research. According to Vice President for University Relations Barbara-Jan Wilson, during the last fundraising campaign, which closed in December of 2004, the University raised $281 million. “We are right on target for the current campaign and will go public having already raised very close to the total amount of our last campaign,” Wilson wrote in an email to The Argus. “That is great news!” Wilson explained that during this campaign, certain groups will be approached more than they were in past years. “We are trying our best to engage younger alumni (GOLD: Graduates of the Last Decade) and parents, as well as our traditional, core donors from the last campaign,” Wilson wrote. Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts explained that the University has various revenue streams, the largest of which are tuition, the endowment draw, and the annual Wesleyan Fund. Meerts said that these streams are incorporated into a long-range financial projection for the University. According to Meerts, many donations are designated for specific uses and projects, and although they increase the overall budget, they do not necessarily relieve existing strains on the budget. “So not necessarily all of the money that comes in is going to be unrestricted and therefore … budget-relieving, so it [only] makes it possible to do other things that we otherwise wouldn’t be able to do,” Meerts said. “And of course I like the campaign, of course I like the $400 million, quite a bit of which we have already received, but I just want to make sure that it’s understood that the net of this is that we will pretty much continue to do what we are doing right now.” However, some restricted donations do help alleviate current strains on the budget, such as donations for new constructions or renovations that the University was previously planning. The donation would then free up money previously set aside for the construction or renovation and thus allow that money to be used for other purposes at the discretion of the University. Still, Meerts noted that unrestricted money would be the most beneficial for the University’s budgetary planning. “So the best thing that could happen is tons of unrestricted money. People say to Wesleyan, ‘Here, we love you, Wesleyan. Here’s money, you decide what to do with it,’” he said. “It doesn’t always work that way.” Nevertheless, Roth expressed optimism about the campaign. “We’ve been very encouraged by the gifts we’ve received,” he said. “I shouldn’t jinx it, but the end of this year should be the best two years we’ve ever had of fundraising, even in a terrible economy.”"
"Students Assemble for Social Justice Leadership Conference","2013-02-28","by Lindsay Dittman, Contributing Writer","Josephine Ho/Staff Photographer On Saturday, Feb. 23, the fifth annual Social Justice Leadership Conference took place at 41 Wyllys Ave. First organized by Associate Director of Student Activities and Leadership Development Elisa Cardona and the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) in 2008, the conference is a community-based initiative that brings students, staff, faculty, and Middletown residents together to lead sessions on social justice and improve their leadership skills. Event coordination was based out of the Office of Student Activities and Leadership Development (SALD). The planning committee was comprised of students and Dean Marina Melendez. “We chose the theme ‘Building Bridges: Connecting Communities Across Difference’ because most people agreed that the idea of allyship was something that we should focus on,” said SALD Leadership Intern Winston Soh ’14. The sessions focused on leadership skills that could be applied to any social movement. One hundred individuals, mostly students, registered for the conference. “I think if there’s a way to get even more students, faculty, and staff to attend, that would be great,” said participant Catherine MacLean ’14. “This is such a unique opportunity that Wesleyan and SALD provide, and it would be great to see more people participate.” The conference began with an 11 a.m. brunch, during which keynote speaker and former Medical Director of the Davison Health Center P. Davis Smith spoke about the role he played in establishing a sexual health clinic that was non-discriminatory to gender identity. After leaving the University, Smith went on to start a practice that focused on serving transgendered patients. “We thought that as someone that people personally knew and could relate to, [Smith] was great for the conference,” Soh said. Syed Ali ’13, a participant at the conference, commented on Smith’s speech. “The keynote speaker, P. Davis Smith, had a powerful message,” Ali said. “The application of allyship in his career was intriguing and inspirational. Smith’s message resonated in terms of quotidian life, practical steps, and social entrepreneurship.” The rest of the day consisted of three 50-minute block sessions, during which a different presenter spoke at each session. A variety of student group members spoke during session blocks one and two. These included Dwight Greene Intern for Community Engagement and Discussion Christian Hosam ’15, Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) Intern Rachel Verner ’15, Queer Resource Center (QRC) Intern Kathryn Thompson ’15, Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitators (WesDEF), President of Economie Dance Kehan Zhou ’15, and a representative from Wesleyan Students for Disability Rights. Topics ranged from how to construct racial bridges through literature to Zhou’s presentation on how to use dance to fight for social justice. The third block included a performance by Rebecca Wyzan ’15 from MIX and two talks by Office of Residential Life Area Coordinator Daniel LaBonte and Director of Religious and Spiritual Life and University Jewish Chaplain Rabbi David Leipziger-Teva. The conference also included a “Reflection and Wrap-Up” session toward the end of the day. “My favorite event was the closing session,” Ali said. “For the very last activity, we all stood in a circle and threw around a colorful ball of yarn. Every person named an action they would take in light of the conference. It was reassuring to see that not only had the conference been a learning experience for so many, but that it could potentially result in tangible changes. At the end, we had a beautiful web of yarn connecting all of us—a physical representation of our community.”"
"Returning to “Practical Idealism,” Or Putting Our Ideals into Better Practice","2013-03-04","by Jason Shatz, Class of 2014","On Sunday, the Wesleyan Student Assembly held a very productive discussion with President Roth about the recent Board of Trustees meetings. Suffice it to say that we held a very informative discussion on matters such as the endowment, the new fundraising campaign, Greek life, and many other matters. If only the spirit of the meeting, and the tone of engagement, extended much farther beyond the WSA itself. I sincerely hope that the WSA is not viewed as a bubble as much as it is the deliberative and representative student body. But the dynamic between the WSA and the rest of the student body has generally been more productive and thoughtful than the one between the rest of the student body and the administration. Both the WSA and the administration have mutually sought to hold one another accountable by the standards of transparency and by the virtues of “practical idealism” and progress. But the amount of engagement between the WSA and the rest of the student body is far short of where it should be. To wit: only twenty students attended a recent forum with President Roth, sponsored by the WSA. The vast majority consisted of members of the WSA itself. The turnout fared only slightly better than the response to Andrew Trexler’s question. At the previous meeting, he reported that he received “a whopping eight” responses from the student body. Trexler said in last week’s Argus, “Students are constantly clamoring for their (rightful) opportunity to take part in guiding Wesleyan forward, and I would be disappointed to see us throw this chance away.” It seems that when we—both North College and the WSA—just gave them such an opportunity, our efforts to engage the student body came to naught. I still stand by my own printed comments on the procedure that we took, since the timing and nature of the “all-campus” email when workloads tend to increase may have prevented many students from giving the thoughtful responses that they were capable of giving. Does this disappointment mean that students are not willing to participate in constructive dialogues like these? I absolutely hope not. Otherwise, I would not have matriculated here. But it does seem that many students are more willing to use harsh language toward administrative decisions that intend to alter unsustainable status quos. In those cases, idealism seems to trump practicality rather than be translated to it. Recently, we heard a large response to the decision to end the current paradigm of “senior cocktails” that has caused literal and figural damage to the University and outside actors. As a member of the SAC, I was among the first students outside of the senior class to find out about the decision. We talked at length about “Dinogate,” as I have started to call it, with Dean Whaley. And here I wish to correct a few major misperceptions. For one, the move to cancel “senior cocktails” as we now know it for future classes was not a punitive action. The diversion of ticket sales to paying the incurred costs at the museum and the subsequent changes to Senior Week comprised the punitive part. What the administration, in concert with the senior class officers, did for future senior classes was a pre-emptive move. It comprises a better safeguard against the destructive effects of binge drinking than those that were put into effect on the bus and at the museum. After all, some seniors snuck harmful substances onto the bus, exemplifying the exultation of alcohol over class camaraderie. The resulting conduct was not “pathetic,” as President Roth called it before the statement was released, but far worse. It was completely appalling, dishonorable, and antithetical to our University’s values. For another, the administration is not anti-Wesleyan-student, and their actions do not warrant the antagonism that many students seem to perceive. In Whaley’s and Backer’s cases, they are portrayed in a negative light by default due to the niches that they hold. These are honorable men, simply doing unpopular jobs. And they care for our community, as I have seen in many conversations with the two. In the President’s case, he is the public face of some recent unpopular but courageous decisions, especially with regard to the University’s finances and financial aid model. Perhaps his is a more palatable persona because of both his niche and his status as an alumnus here. And the move should not be interpreted as a zero-sum game. As the Wesleying poster “pyrotechnics” (I do not know his name) noted, the paradigm used to honor student-faculty bonds and other things that supported the notion of the community. The disaster of February 15 was the result of a “gradual but mutually reinforcing cycle of behavioral change,” one that contradicts the traditions of class camaraderie and faculty-student bonds that attracted many students here, myself included. Thus, I am disappointed once again in my fellow students for misconstruing the administrative decision. The ideal that we should leave the “senior cocktails” tradition as is, does not reflect the impractical matter of incurring legal and reputational costs from the culture of binge drinking that we should try to curtail. We should instead embrace the challenge of reversing the aforementioned trend, as it has eroded the shaky foundations upon which our relatively small amount of collective school spirit is based. Not that we should have the same traditions as other schools, but we should start creating a new set of traditions that reflect our values. My critique shall not be misconstrued to be a full defense of the administration’s actions. It too is imperfect, and I am more than willing to hold them accountable for moves that I believe will cause more harm than good. I will certainly try to hold them accountable, as I try to do for my peers. For example, I, along with several other students, voiced concerns about the proposed development across High Street from 202 Washington Street—my old house—due to the problematic traffic flow there. Instead, I wish to help the administration and my peers reinvigorate the paradigm where the student body and the administration hold each other mutually accountable while embracing each other’s desire to move the school forward. If we disagree with their actions, may we hold them accountable for those alone. Let us not describe them with unwarranted adjectives. At the same time, as a member of the Wesleyan Student Assembly and of the University in general, I encourage all members to hold me accountable where necessary. We are all our brothers’ keepers, and we have not acted in that manner to the extent that I would have liked to see during my time here. This may be one of the ways in which my own idealism has overshadowed my practicality. The WSA has tabled the vote on the controversial Neon Deli resolution in order to get more student feedback. Several representatives, myself included, have voiced the desire to generate a survey. I hope that if this happens, students will use this valuable opportunity to help shape the future of our school. May we hope that the research discussion was an aberration in a long-standing tradition of all-campus dialogue. Hopeful as I am due to recent discussions on diversity on campus, I would like to see our ideals translated into both practicality and practice. Let us continue the dialogue throughout the break and beyond, for we all share the duty of being informed participants in productive discussions that will help move our beloved University forward."
"Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity at Met Revitalizes an Old Age","2013-03-28","by Yi Ding, Contributing Writer","“The latest fashion…is absolutely necessary for a painting. It’s what matters most,” read  a quotation by Edouard Manet displayed at the entrance of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s exhibition Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity, on view from Feb. 26 to May 27. The Paris-centric exhibition reveals how painters from the mid-1860s to the mid-1880s “embrace la mode (fashion) as the harbinger of la modernité (modernity),” as the website description for the exhibit explains. Featuring the most important art works of Impressionism and its contemporaries, such as Monet’s “Luncheon on the Grass,” the exhibition is a must-see for those who crave the opportunity to see precious 19th-century modernist artworks selected from museums such as Musée d’Orsay, The Art Institute of Chicago, and the National Portrait Gallery in London. By presenting more than 80 paintings accompanied by period apparel—such as a gray and green striped silk day dress that sets the stage for Monet’s captivating “Camille,” delicate 19th-century fans, fashion plates, photographs, and popular prints—the exhibition transmits the charming ambiance of late-19th-century Paris to viewers in a very intimate way. Looking at the paintings with an eye toward fashion, viewers get a glimpse of Parisian society. For example, one dress bears close resemblance to that depicted in Renoir’s “Madame Georges Charpentier et ses Enfants,” painted in 1878. Along with the Japanese-style drawing room of the family’s Parisian townhouse in the painting, the black silk gown is a testament to Madame Charpentier’s stylish taste. As a nostalgic Owen Wilson in “Midnight in Paris” understands some paintings by mysteriously traveling back to the 1920s every midnight, viewers of this exhibition also get a great opportunity to understand modernity, the core concept dealt with by impressionists and their contemporaries, by looking at famous paintings through the lens of fashion. By reimagining figure painting, exploring the effects of light and shade on newly aniline-dyed fabrics, and focusing on accessories such as single jet earrings, artists of that time aligned with Baudelaire’s definition of modernity as “the ephemeral, the fugitive, the contingent” through different treatment of fashion. In addition to considering Manet’s treatment of the female figure in his paintings in a sexual, and thus controversial way, viewers may be inspired to reconsider his works, such as the famous “Lady with Fan (Portrait of Nina de Callias),” from a fashion perspective. With her golden bangles, bolero jacket, and Algerian shirt, Nina was a dramatic contrast to most female figures in other paintings in this exhibition, including Madame Charpentier in Renoir’s portrait. The exhibition ended with the topic of Spaces of Modern Life. Indeed, public spaces such as grand ballrooms, gilded theater boxes, and open gatherings offered “new vistas and venues to see and to be seen,” according to the exhibition description. And fashion is the epitome of such a visual culture. The unique perspective of the exhibition, which the catalog claims is the “first to explore fashion as a critical aspect of modernity,” provides a fresh look into Parisian life and modernity as a whole."
"Chalk is Talk: Is Wesleyan’s Chalking Ban Illegal?","2013-03-29","by Eric Stephen, Assistant Editor-in-Chief, Emeritus","Shannon Welch/Photo Editor Wesleyan University is now just under halfway into the 11th year of a blanket moratorium on chalking on campus property. The moratorium (or perhaps we should just call it a ban since there is nothing to suggest that this is a temporary limitation), announced on Oct. 3, 2002 in a campus-wide email by then-President Douglas Bennet, was justified on the grounds that “halking, as practiced, undermines our sense of community and impedes substantive dialogue.” While both Presidents Bennet (1995-2007) and Michael Roth (2007-) have provided justifications for the ban on chalking, both arguments appear to be predicated on the notion that, because Wesleyan is a private institution, the University has no responsibility to state or federal protections of freedom of speech. As a result, student response to the ban over the course of the last decade has focused on the ethical issues surrounding a suppression of speech and not the legality of the moratorium itself. However, state law suggests that this story is not so simple. It is time, therefore, for the dog to bark—for students to look critically at the prohibition to see whether the University is enforcing an illegal policy and, more broadly, what rights we as students have to speak within our privately owned ivory tower. In this article, it will be argued that Wesleyan’s chalking ban is facially unenforceable because it violates Connecticut state law, specifically Connecticut General Statute §31-51q, which, in brief, protects some employee speech from infringement by an employer. The chalking ban is overbroad in that it prohibits some legally protected speech—for example, that of students who are employed by the University—and therefore is an invalid policy that should no longer be imposed until sufficient considerations are made regarding free speech rights on campus. Federal Constitutional Protections of Free Speech The First Amendment to the United States Constitution affirms that “Congress shall pass no law…abridging the freedom of speech.” Although the Free Speech Clause now applies to state governments under the Fourteenth Amendment, Gitlow v. New York (1925), constitutional protections in general do not ordinarily extend to infringements by private actors. DeShaney v. Winnebago County(1989). This is to say, for example, that an individual does not have the constitutional right to enter the house of another person to preach to her. Private actors, such as people or institutions that are not affiliated with the government, are able to infringe upon the speech of others without constitutional recourse. Thus, the first question to ask when determining the legality of the chalking ban is whether the University is itself a private actor. In Marsh v. Alabama (1946), the Supreme Court found that “the more an owner, for his advantage, opens up his property for use by the public in general, the more do his rights become circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who use it.” However, in Rendell-Baker v. Kohn (1982), the Court later refused to consider a privately owned school to be a state actor, even though the school received money from the government and the school served a genuine public function. It appears, then, that there is little argument that could be made that Wesleyan University is not a private actor for the purposes of the First Amendment. However, there are a few caveats in the jurisprudence subsequent to Marsh that require exploration. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins (1980), for example, suggests that, although limitations on speech by private actors may not trigger federal protection, state constitutions may confer expanded speech rights than the federal constitution requires. In this case, the Court determined that the California state constitution codified much broader protections for free speech than the federal constitution, and the more expansive state constitution should be respected in instances such as these. Similarly, Hudgens v. NLRB (1976) explains that state laws “may in some situations extend protection or provide redress against a private corporation or person who seeks to abridge the free expression of others.” Thus, if we do not dispute the claim that Wesleyan is a private actor, it appears from Marsh, Hudgens, and PruneYard that the University may still be limited on the types of speech it can infringe upon by both the Connecticut state constitution and also state law. Shannon Welch/Photo Editor Connecticut State Constitutional Protections on Free Speech Following PruneYard, the state constitution may trigger broader free speech protections than the federal constitution. For the purposes of free speech, the most relevant sections of the Connecticut Constitution would include §4 “Every citizen may freely speak, write, and publish his sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of that liberty” and §14 “The citizens have a right, in a peaceable manner, to assemble for their common good, and to apply those invested with the powers of government, for redress of grievances, or other proper purposes, by petition, address, or remonstrance.” (For religious speech, §3 will also be implicated.) According to the Connecticut Supreme Court, however, the Connecticut Constitution is not expansive enough to protect speech against infringement by private actors. In Cologne v. Westfarms Associates (1984), the state court determined that there was “no evidence [in the Connecticut Constitution] of any intention to vest in those seeking to exercise such rights as free speech and petition the privilege of doing so upon the property of others” (on page 59 suggesting that this even applies to private university property). Thus, unlike California in PruneYard (or New Jersey, Colorado, Oregon, Massachusetts, Washington, and Pennsylvania similarly), the state constitution of Connecticut does not enshrine free speech protections when dealing with private actors. Connecticut Statutory Protections on Free Speech However, as noted in PruneYard, “a state may adopt, in its own constitution, individual liberties more expansive than those conferred by the federal constitution and a statute is, for that purpose, in the same category as a state constitution.”  Thus, it is possible that some refuge can be found in state law for questioning the legality of the chalking ban. Although there is no statute that protects all individuals from having their speech restrained by private actors, there appears to be some limitations that exist specifically to protect the speech of employees. Connecticut General Statute §31-51q holds that “Any employer…who subjects any employee to discipline or discharge on account of the exercise by such employee of rights guaranteed by the first amendment to the United States Constitution or section 3, 4, or 14 of article first of the Constitution of the state, provided such activity does not substantially or materially interfere with the employee’s bona fide job performance or the working relationship between the employee and employer, shall be liable to such employee for damages caused by such discipline or discharge…” Simply put, employees are afforded legal protections against discipline or discharge from their employers for speech if (1) that speech is otherwise constitutionally protected, and (2) that speech does not substantially interfere with job performance or a working relationship. This understanding, albeit somewhat more limited, was affirmed by the Connecticut Supreme Court in Cotto v. United Technologies (1999): “We conclude that §31-51q applies to some activities and speech that occur at the workplace because…there is no prohibition that prevents a legislature from protecting employee speech wherever it occurs.” However, Cotto did provide some further qualifications. According to Cotto, §31-51q parallels federal statute 42 U.S.C. §1983, and thus Supreme Court interpretations of that law should inform state law as well. According to the Supreme Court in Waters v. Churchill  (1994), in order to be protected by Section 1983, “the speech must be on a matter of public concern, and the employee’s interest in expressing himself on this matter must not be outweighed by any injury the speech could cause” to employee relationships. Similarly, in Connick v. Myers (1983), the Court found that “conduct at a governmental employer’s workplace is not constitutionally protected unless the expressive activity concerns a matter of public, social, or other concern to the country.” Finally, although not mentioned in Cotto because it was not at issue in the facts of the case, Section 1983 can also protect religious speech, including religious speech that does not abut national concerns. Rosenberger v. University of Virginia (1995). Following the Court in Cotto, it therefore appears that any employee, including student employees, can invoke §31-51q for employer discipline as a result of their speech if  (1) the speech is otherwise constitutionally protected, (2) the speech does not substantially interfere with job performance or the working relationship, and (3) the speech is either religious or of pressing national concern. To be sure, there exist some forms of speech that can meet all three above requirements. As a result, the University cannot, without second thought to civil liberties, ban any and all speech that it dislikes. In the state of Connecticut, some speech cannot be infringed upon, even by private employers. For chalking to be protected by §31-51q, we must first argue that chalking is constitutionally protected speech. From there, it would likely be most useful to next argue that the moratorium is facially invalid because of overbreadth—it does not allow for speech that withstands prongs two and three above to survive on University campus despite legal protection.

"Campus Climate Survey Circulates Campus","2013-04-11","by Sophie Zinser, Staff Writer","On March 25, Vice President for Institutional Partnerships and Chief Diversity Officer Sonia Mañjon emailed a Campus Climate Survey to students, faculty, and staff. Less than 12 percent of the student body had completed the survey as of Monday, April 8. Four reminder emails have been sent from various faculty and staff members, including one earlier this week from Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Whaley. According to Mañjon, although student response rates have been low, the faculty and staff response rate is currently already over 40 percent. The survey is a part of the Making Excellence Inclusive (MEI) Initiative, which the University launched in the spring of 2010. The MEI is composed of a series of programs designed to spark discussion about issues of diversity and inequality on campus. The goal of these programs is to make the University feel more inclusive to all students. The Campus Climate Survey will provide quantitative data to supplement verbal and written testimony of individuals who have expressed issues of discomfort with certain aspects of the campus culture. Mañjon said the data that the survey will provide will be integral to the mission of all of the programs in the MEI initiative. “This data will substantiate what I’ve [been] saying all along,” Mañjon said. “When I go into cabinet meetings and talk about the climate of certain segments of the student population, my colleagues around the table are asking, ‘How do you substantiate that?’” Wesleyan belongs to a consortium of Liberal Arts Diversity Officers (LADO) with its peer institutions, including Middlebury, Amherst, Williams, and Connecticut College. Each LADO school has chief diversity officers in high-ranked administrative positions. Diversity Officers at several other LADO schools are in the process of implementing the same Campus Climate Survey on their campuses. The Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles developed the Campus Climate Survey. The University chose the survey because it includes both specific questions about issues of diversity and inequality and more general questions about a student’s relationship with other social, academic, and extracurricular aspects of campus life. Mañjon sees this survey as a way to compare the issues of the student body at Wesleyan with the issues of students at other peer institutions. Mañjon has received emails from students who stated that they did not finish or refrained from starting the survey because it was too long. She explained that she was shocked that some students suggested that she offer incentives to complete the survey. “I would hope that as a result of the Diversity University forum that happened last semester, that students would want to understand the climate on campus around issues like this and that would be incentive enough for them to take it,” Mañjon said. “As students, this is your campus. At the end of the day, you’re either invested in it and think things are fine, or you think there are areas in which…we can improve. The response rate will let me know how serious students are about this.” Most students agree that the issue of evaluating the campus climate is important, but some argue that a 20-minute anonymous survey is not the best approach to maximize student response rates. Tessa Bellone ’16 thought that the survey was spam at first until she was sent more emails about it. She stopped taking the survey after opening it when she realized that it was optional. “I had other things on my mind, so it didn’t seem like a priority,” Bellone said. “I also assumed that since it is such a pressing issue, other people would do it, so if I didn’t, it wouldn’t be a big deal.” Many students reported being deterred from completing the survey because of its length. Crystal Wright ’16 suggested that students will be unlikely to devote more than 10 minutes to an optional survey. Wright has not completed the survey. Johnny LaZebnik ’16 began the survey, but upon realizing how long it was, stopped working on it. “The more of it I took, the less accurate it got because I was so frantic to get done with it,” Lazebnik said. Rachel Fox ’16 reported being confused by the use of the word “climate” in the survey’s title. “At first I thought that it was about the weather,” she said. “I didn’t see much of a point in completing a survey about that.” Many students claimed they were unsure whether the phrase “Campus Climate” was referring to the effects of global climate change on campus or to the general atmosphere of the University’s student body. According to Dean for Diversity and Student Engagement Renee Johnson-Thornton, the word “climate” was used to refer to the social culture at the University. Johnson-Thornton also oversees the Campus Climate Log, an online forum for testimonials, event listings, and other discussions of diversity and inclusion on campus. “The whole mention of climate comes from research,” Johnson-Thornton said. “It came from an article years ago that was talking about the experiences that some women were having when they felt a chilly environment in certain spaces…They felt like, ‘Yes, you’re allowed to come in,’ but [they didn’t] really feel the warmth.” Johnson-Thornton also hopes that the results of the survey will aid the MEI in developing and expanding its programmatic initiatives, which include the Beman Triangle Project, efforts to comply with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), and the Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitation Program (WesDEF). The Beman Triangle Project is an archaeological and sociological exploration of the area bounded by Vine Street, Cross Street, and Knowles Avenue that was once the site of a 19th-century African American community associated with the Cross Street African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. The MEI is also working to ensure that the University’s historical holdings, including sacred remains and objects of Native American tribes, are in compliance with NAGPRA requirements. The WesDEF program, also funded by the MEI, trains students to be diversity facilitators and educators on campus. The Campus Climate survey will provide information as to which programs the University should adapt while moving forward. “We want to do good work,” Johnson-Thornton said. “We have models that show that we are doing good work. With the help of this survey, we will move from theory to practice and make sure that as the population of students that enroll in top colleges becomes more diverse, we are creating an environment where everyone will thrive.”"
"University to Host First Diversity Awards Ceremony","2013-04-11","by Millie Dent, Assistant News Editor","On April 28, the University will host the first Edgar Beckham Helping Hands Award Ceremony. The event will celebrate and recognize exemplary students who have exhibited cultural sensitivity and who promote diversity and inclusion. Phabinly Gabriel ’13 and Luciana Pennant ’13 initiated the award ceremony on campus. Gabriel explained the award is named after the University’s first African American dean. “[Beckham] was an advocate for diversity in education and academic excellence,” Gabriel said. “Basically, we made the program originally to celebrate students who have done well academically and have done some form of civic engagement toward the Wesleyan campus.” University President Michael Roth praised the efforts of Gabriel and Pennant. He said he believes the awards ceremony is a way to unite members of the University community. “The best part about it is that it’s a student initiative,” Roth said. “It’s meant to help build community and to recognize people who are being helpful in that endeavor.” Vice President for Institutional Partnerships and Chief Diversity Officer Sonia Mañjon supported both Gabriel and Pennant with their endeavors. Mañjon noted that the University needs an occassion such as this to contrast with recent events. “[I learned about the ceremony] right after the big scenario that happened at the Connecticut Science Center with the senior class,” Mañjon said. “So I’m thinking we need to do something that’s on campus, that’s not an opportunity for students to just drink and pass out and get drunk…So I am very much supportive of the idea and impressed with what they [have] done in the short amount of time that they’ve had to coordinate it.” The awards ceremony will honor two freshmen, two sophomores, two juniors, and eight seniors. The organizers plan to use results from various surveys in the future to refine the program in years to come. “We’re really hoping that this will turn into a tradition and grow larger,” Gabriel said. Ten to twelve faculty and staff will receive awards for their advisory roles for students. “We know that there are a lot of students who have been under a faculty or staff member who have pointed them in the right direction, [and] kept them encouraged through their years, or throughout some time,” Pennant said. “Or, if they didn’t do it, then they at least pointed [the students] in the right direction as to who to go to.” Gabriel and Pennant believe it is important to include all class years in the event, so that everyone in the community has a specific goal toward which to work. They hope that underclassmen will recognize and act on behalf of the greater needs of the University community. “We wanted to make sure to include freshman and sophomores, because when [they] come in…they don’t have this idea that you have got to buckle down,” Pennant said. “…We really believe that recognition brings about more encouragement for people to do better and it holds them accountable for their actions.” Students are nominated by faculty, staff, or fellow students; self-nomination is prohibited. Short blurbs accompany the nomination and final decisions are chosen by a jury committee of alumni who are at least five years removed from the graduating class. Students also vote for faculty and staff awards through an email survey. Gabriel said he hopes alumni engagement in both the voting process and the ceremony will help students foster connections for post-graduate plans. “By allowing [alumni] to come and interact with us in this celebration, [students] can really network, build connections, maybe even land a summer internship or help them land a certain connection that would help them find a future job,” Gabriel said. “This really gives a glimpse of what Wesleyan alumni are doing, how they have progressed from being students at Wesleyan to prominent alumni currently.” All students are encouraged to sign up for the event, although space is limited to about 30 students per class year. Tickets are $20, but faculty members can sponsor students. “We don’t need to be in the news again for destroying the science center,” Pennant said. “We don’t need to be in the news for Holi for the whole world to hear about us. We don’t need to be in the news again for the forum. We need something positive and we need everyone to keep experiencing the positive things at Wesleyan so that when they leave they actually enjoy being alumni.” Mañjon hopes this will encourage seniors to focus more on helping the community and each other. “I’m hoping…that they embark on senior activities that are more about giving back to the community,” Mañjon said. “Last year I worked with the senior class on an event in the spring where they literally worked with the community, the vendors on Main Street, to do a cleanup and to just bring visibility to the campus-community partnerships. It was a way for seniors to really recognize this larger community, not just Wesleyan, but Middletown, and really give back in their last year. So I’m hoping the senior classes will really look more towards these types of activities in the future.”"
"MINDS to Host Discussion on Mental Illness Stigmas","2013-04-15","by Christina Norris, News Editor","The Mental Illness and Neurological Disorders Foundation (MINDS) is attempting to spark discussion at the University on the stigmatization of mental illness. On Thursday, April 18, the group will host a discussion featuring panelists who work with mental illness, including University Director of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Dr. Jennifer D’Andrea and Associate Professor of Psychology and Neuroscience and Behavior Matthew Kurtz. The MINDS Foundation, founded in 2010 by Raghu Appasani ’12, aims to eliminate the stigma of mental illness in rural areas of India, where many locals lack access to treatment. The mission of the University’s chapter is to combat stigmatization at the University and in Middletown. Appasani will moderate the panel. “I suggested that [the University’s chapter of MINDS] do something like this over WesFest because the majority of our support or interest from alumni or students at Wesleyan comes from these sorts of Wes seminars or panels,” Appasani said. “We don’t want to just focus on fundraising. We want to give people more of an idea of what we do and why we’re doing it.” Appasani explained that he intends to open the discussion with introductions of the panelists. The panelists will then focus on what attracted them to the field of mental health, what they consider to be the largest local issues concerning mental health awareness, and potential solutions. The audience will then be given the opportunity to ask questions. Co-Presidents of the University’s chapter of MINDS Ian Johnson ’13 and Shyam Desai ’15 helped organize the event. “Since the beginning of the semester we’ve wanted to have a panel…to start some sort of discussion on mental illness and possibly to make the Wesleyan community aware of the situation and get them involved in the discussion as well,” Desai said. “We thought WesFest would be the perfect time to do it.” Desai explained that the topic of the panel, stigmatization of mental illness, is not focused  merely on the trend as it exists in India but also on ways in which it is manifested in the local community. “Many people don’t think about the issue, but it’s huge on a college campus,” Desai said. Appasani hopes that the forum will help further understanding and engagement on campus. “I want more people to stay engaged with the issue and to recognize that it is such a big issue and that it’s a growing issue that’s getting worse and needs more attention,” Appasani said. “We know that from recent events that are sparking conversation of changing policies, but [the stigmatization]’s not really going anywhere.” Kurtz, who recently visited the hospital in India with which MINDS has a partnership, has similar hopes for the outcome of the panel. “I think it would be wonderful just to educate people who are at the panel about mental illness so that they have a sense of what it is, so that they have a sense of what our clients are up against in terms of stigma, and also to understand that it is a worldwide problem, and [that] there’s an organization at Wesleyan that’s trying to address it,” he said. Kurtz explained that he was eager to take part in the panel because of his own experiences with patients who suffer from mental illness. In his own research, Kurtz focuses on cognitive difficulties among people with schizophrenia. “The issue of stigma in mental illness is definitely something that’s very close to my heart,” Kurtz said. “I’ve devoted basically my life to studying [schizophrenia]. I feel for the clients and the difficulties they have negotiating everyday life and the stigma that they experience in everyday life with the disease.” In an email to The Argus, D’Andrea described her personal motivation to participate in the panel, explaining that throughout her four years with CAPS, she has noticed that students consistently compare themselves to what she calls the “ideal Wesleyan student.” “This imaginary student takes five courses per semester and always gets As, lines up amazing summer internships, juggles four or five extracurricular commitments every semester, has deeply satisfying personal relationships as well as an amazing social life, and never feels anxiety, stress, sadness, indecision, or disappointment,” D’Andrea wrote. “When students struggle with depression or anxiety, and feel too low or too overwhelmed to complete assignments or attend classes, or when they feel lonely and isolated because they haven’t made close personal connections, they believe they are the only ones….Stigma reduction means teaching people that they are not alone.” D’Andrea expressed concerns that because of the stigma attached to mental illness, many people, including students at the University, do not seek treatment. Assistant Professor of Psychiatry at the Yale School of Medicine and member of the MINDS advisory board Maya Prahbu explained that she has similar concerns. “I hope that people will realize that stigmatization is not just a problem in other countries but continues to be an issue even in local communities in that all people are the same,” Prahbu said. “No one wants to be labeled as ‘crazy,’ and everyone recognizes that, while they may have mental health problems, getting treatment will often result in them being viewed differently by friends or family or colleagues in their community, and so people not just in the U.S. but certainly abroad tend to delay treatments. [This] is unfortunate.” Johnson stated that he sees mental illness as an often-ignored, global issue. “[The discussion] will definitely be insightful for everyone involved,” he said. “It’s something that people don’t think about much, but it definitely affects [everyone].” Appasani hopes that the conversation on mental illness will continue after the panel ends. “I think it would just be really cool to keep a conversation going afterwards and really get the audience involved,” he said. “I just want people to step away thinking about it and keep the conversation going around the issue.” The panel will be held on Thursday, April 18 at 7 p.m. in Fisk 302."

"Matt Motta ’13 Creates WSA Elections Poll","2013-04-22","by Urvashi Pathania, Staff Writer","In an effort to help inform student voters, Matt Motta ’13 constructed a poll on this year’s Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) presidential and vice presidential elections. WSA Vice President and Chair of the Organizational and External Affairs Committee (OEAC) Mari Jarris ’14, WSA Student Affairs Committee Chair Nicole Updegrove ’14, and Keith Conway ’16 are running for president, while Finance and Facilities Chair Andrew Trexler ’14 and Vice-Chair of the OEAC Chloe Murtagh ’15 are running for vice president. The poll was posted on Wesleying, and Motta asked a range of questions about voter opinions, including the level of voter confidence and voter sentiment in relation to the WSA, using a feelings thermometer. He explained that an analysis of the poll reveals noteworthy results and that he hopes the University community will appreciate an empirical understanding of the races. “Voters’ interests and voters’ confidence seems to draw a line between the two candidates,” Motta said. “It seems like interested voters prefer Nicole, and they are more confident in their decisions. It’s still a tight race, and I am glad people are going to get a chance to look at this.” Motta, a graduating senior and government major, is interested in political science and decided to spend his spare time creating this poll. “I’ve never done this before,” he said. “I have never been involved with WSA politics before and have no affiliation with  the WSA. I just thought it would be a fun thing to do for my senior year.” Motta noted that, though Updegrove requested to see the results, he initiated the poll because of his own personal interest, and the methods used to obtain data were not slanted toward any one candidate. “While Nicole expressed an interest to me about the results, the methodology was completely unbiased,” Motta wrote in a message to The Argus. “In fact, it wouldn’t do anyone reading the numbers any good if that wasn’t true.” Motta acknowledged that although the methodology of the poll was unbiased, the scope of participants is limited because the survey was mainly posted on Wesleying, with some Facebook publicity as well. “There is a bias to people who responded to this as it is the people who check Wesleying,” Motta said. “But the people who actually have enough motivation to go out and vote should be relatively similar to the people who check Wesleying.” According to Motta, 114 students started the poll, and 54 people finished it. “I had to drop some of them because they aren’t actually Wesleyan students,” Motta explained. “I also had to drop some of the people that did not complete the poll, although I factored them into one of the questions in order to get a clearer picture.” The poll revealed that people who did not finish the survey were less likely to have already chosen a candidate. Responses to a question about the degree of voter engagement illustrated that most undecided participants have spent time thinking about the election despite their indecision. Students of all class years can vote now at wsa.wesleyan.edu/voting. Voting lasts until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, April 26."
"Middletown May Day Events Unify Community","2013-05-02","by Stephanie Ling, Staff Writer","Dat Vu/Staff Photographer The first of May signified International Workers’ Day, and several University students, in conjunction with other Middletown residents, organized a variety of events in honor of the occasion. Planned events included the revitalization and reclaiming of a community garden located between Washington Street and Pearl Street, a teach-in at Middlesex Community College, and, to conclude the day, a citizens’ assembly in Spear Park at the intersection of William and Main Streets. The desire to organize these events came out of momentum resulting from  Occupy movements and community meetings, called encuentros, which also focused on community engagement. “It came out of a group of people who had been doing various different measures ever since Occupy started,” said activist Ross Levin ’15. “What inspired this May Day action was the desire to bring encuentro to the streets, and instead of having a private meeting, we’d have a public meeting and a lot of reaching out into Middletown.” Each of the May Day events was arranged through the efforts of different groups of people throughout the community. “We wanted to get in one big [movement] that really captured the sentiments of the people in our group, and a lot of people are angry about what is going on the in the world,” Levin said. “People shouldn’t be angry and frustrated in isolation, because a lot of other people are going through the same things, so before this semester ended, we wanted to get in one really good way for people to come together over these sorts of things.” A group of several Middletown residents involved in resisting the divestment of several Washington Street homes helped initiate the new garden project. The event description invited members of the community to “help revitalize a community garden that is under threat from the proposed strip mall construction” and help “reclaim space from private interests and cultivate it in service of our community.” Stephen Krevisky, a professor of mathematics at Middlesex Community College and community activist, predominantly organized the teach-in at the school, which featured several different speakers, including Joanne Sheehan of the War Resisters League, Stanley Heller of the Middle East Crisis Committee, and other Middletown activists. “We wanted to get people involved in a variety of forms of activism, and I think through these different gatherings—encuentros as we call them, or batista-style community gatherings—we can give people from the town and the colleges the chance to speak up about different social issues, be it war, the sequestering of budget cuts, or corporate takeovers,” Krevinsky explained. Krevinsky has been actively involved in activism for decades, participating in peace marches and sit-ins related to a variety of causes, including the protesting of the Vietnam and Iraq wars. Now, as a citizen of Middletown, he has wanted to create a similar environment of striving for change in the community. “We’ve been hoping to pull something together that could energize people, build community and dialogue, and make some things happen around here about a lot of issues that people care about,” Krevinsky said. The May Day events emphasized unifying groups of individuals of varying backgrounds through discussion of shared concerns and interests surrounding current happenings in the world. “For me, it’s really about building community and building a group of diverse people who are connected through the long term through these sorts of [sentiments],” Levin said. “These sorts of events have really come from the existence of that type of community that’s based in resisting oppression and injustice and working towards a better life for everyone.” The general citizens’ assembly that culminated the day of gatherings had a relaxed atmosphere and included free food. “Among the folks at the People’s Assembly, the workers might be concerned about wages, the students about debt, the poor folks about welfare, and the old folks about social security—but when we come together in dialogue with one another, we see that all our grievances are connected,” wrote participant Daniel Plafker ’15 in an email to The Argus. “Our seemingly disparate struggles are really one struggle against capitalist exploitation and the hierarchical state. No problem is an individual problem; these things are products of the structural elements within society.” According to Andrew Olson ’16, the environment was positive. He enjoyed meeting different members of the community and especially liked participating in constructive and insightful conversation. “May Day is about people coming together in the community,” Olsen said. “It was a good-natured sort of meeting, but people were talking about serious issues.” Olson described the assembly as hugely successful, and the group of attendees agreed to start a new tradition of meeting in the park every Friday to partake in similar discussions. “The more we spread our activism into Middletown, the better, and there is so much that we can learn from the citizens of Middletown.” Olson said. “Even if you don’t identify with their backgrounds or beliefs, they are so passionate, and it was an extremely positive experience that I came away feeling so energized from.” If the May Day proceedings are considered successful and spur more interest, Krevinsky and Levin foresee the reoccurrence of these events for future years. “I’m hoping that there could be more on-going connections between the Wesleyan campus, Middlesex Community College, and community people in the long run and in the short run,” Krevinsky said."
"Student Forums Promise Immersive Learning Experiences","2013-09-05","by Adam Keller, Features Editor","Have another credit slot to fill? Intimidated by all those professors with fancy graduate degrees and gray hairs? Check out this semester’s crop of Student Forums, where student leaders guide their Wesleyan colleagues through curricula and activities that they have designed themselves. There are fewer forums this semester than last, but these five courses are sure to stimulate your learning experience and contribute to campus culture. Food Justice & Sustainability at Wesleyan and Beyond Student Leaders: Jennifer Roach ’14, Rachel Weisberg ’15, Kathryn Hardt ’15 Faculty Sponsor: Director of the College of the Environment and Chair of the Environmental Studies Program Barry Chernoff The dedication of many University students to food justice and sustainability is well-known, both around campus and nationwide (we’ve been named “Most Vegan-Friendly College” in the Small Schools category by Peta2—twice), and this course is sure to bolster awareness of those issues within the community. Hardt said that one of the class’ primary goals is to consolidate the food activism movement on campus, which includes reaching out to people who are not already involved. “I have been involved in WesFresh, a student group that involves food activism on campus, and felt [that] to have a whole class that’s really centered around food, and approaching it from all different angles and all different disciplines, to be an introduction to food systems and food issues, would be a really cool opportunity to pull in even more students who have experience or maybe don’t have experience,” Hardt said. In addition to motivating students through coursework (the class’ final project will involve presenting on a food item and tracing its origins), one of the forum’s major goals is to promote food activism at the University. Hardt outlined two of the activist projects that the class will embark on later in the semester. “Food Day is October 26, I believe, so we’ll be planning as a class some kind of awareness, action thing for that,” she said. “And then the second project we’re going to be working on together is using one activist group that works with campus…food that has what they call a Real Food Calculator, which is basically a system of auditing your food purchases in the dining hall…. We’re going to be looking at Usdan’s purchases and evaluating them for how many local and fairly produced products we’re buying and how we can improve.” Signing and Spatial Cognition Student Leaders: Miranda Orbach ’15, Emma MacLean ’14 Faculty Sponsor: Associate Professor of American Studies and Anthropology Margot Weiss After Wesleyan’s American Sign Language II course was cut last year due to budget issues, several students involved in Wesleyan’s ASL community took it upon themselves to provide materials from that class’ curriculum in a new setting. Students in this forum will continue to develop ASL linguistic skills while teaching sign language sessions at MacDonough Elementary School, just a few blocks off campus. According to Emma MacLean, in addition to functioning as a linguistics class, this forum will use scientific research to look at how communication through a visual language affects the development of cognitive skills. “We’re gonna start with deaf people who have had almost no language input at all, and then are introduced to sign, and how that changes the way they visualize and can articulate things,” Emma Maclean said. “There are some crazy, incredible stories about people who are given language and how they’re given words and are like, ‘Oh, everything has a name,’ just really incredible things that we totally take for granted. And then moving down into how using a spatial grammar and the reinforcement of that in daily life can change your ability to do other things. There have been studies that show that deaf kids have a better sense of space because the grammar that they’re using is based in space. And that can also be transferred into hearing people who sign.” Emma MacLean also mentioned research citing that developing sign language classes in schools with low socioeconomic status can boost test scores in other areas, which is the basis for the teaching program at MacDonough. Students will pair up in teams and go to the school to teach children in hour-long sessions, giving kids engaged learning sessions that will hopefully encourage higher concentration across all subjects. “The kids who have a lot of energy as kindergarteners and first graders tend to sit pretty still when you ask them to make their language physical,” Emma MacLean said. “All of a sudden, there’s a place to put your energy.” The Humanity of Medicine Student Leader: Catherine MacLean ’14 Faculty Sponsor: Chair of Science in Society and Professor of Philosophy and Environmental Studies Joseph Rouse Those interested in nabbing an MD know that the amount of empirical information you must stuff in your brain to be accepted into—let alone succeed in—the brutal, trial-by-fire of medical school is no joke. While all of that stuff is really important (you wouldn’t want your life in the hands of a doctor who doesn’t know exactly how your body works), according to Catherine MacLean, these pressures of memorization and performance can detract from students’ conceptual, philosophical engagement with medicine. “Medical practitioners are fallible human beings, but they are asked to be super human,” Catherine MacLean wrote in an email to The Argus. “Medicine is an institution like any other, and it can and should be studied with the same interdisciplinary, critical eye that we study any other institution with.” Students in the forum will discuss readings about the institution of medicine and how it functions within different communities, and the cultural factors that must be taken into consideration when treating a patient. In addition, students will have the opportunity to engage with medicinal practice through the arts. Theater performance and creative writing will give members of the forum a broader, more humanities-minded perspective on medicine than what they typically gain from their coursework. “I hope students learn a little more about what getting into medicine might entail, and that they are able to make a more informed choice about their paths after Wesleyan,” Catherine MacLean wrote. “I also hope that when they head into medical professions, they use the awareness they’ve gained in this course to be a more well-rounded, compassionate, and purposeful practitioner. That is a somewhat lofty goal. As long as everyone feels it was time well spent, I’ll be happy.” Cantonese for Beginners Student Leaders: Alecia Ng ’14, Vanessa Chen ’16 Faculty Sponsor: Adjunct Associate Professor of Asian Languages and Literatures and East Asian Studies Xiaomiao Zhu Cantonese is one of the most widely-spoken Chinese dialects, resembling the more common dialect of Mandarin, but in effect a completely different language. Widely spoken in Hong Kong and Macau in addition to some areas of mainland China, Cantonese hasn’t been offered at the University until now. Ng said that the idea to teach Cantonese came about through her own informal tutoring in the language with her close group of friends. “I started this forum because I kind of taught my friends Cantonese for the past two years at Wesleyan, and all of them were saying, ‘You should start a forum so we can get credit,’” Ng said. “Because, I mean, once a week, I was teaching them, and I like teaching different languages.” Ng described the coursework as rigorous introductory-level Cantonese exercises that will emphasize speech over writing, so as to avoid alienating participants with no fluency in Mandarin. “We’re thinking about having a lot of games and conversations, and having people do 30-second or one-minute presentations,” Ng said. “As long as they can make a conversation with other people, that’s what we’re hoping [for]. We’ve received a lot of inquiries, so we’re pretty excited about the whole thing. It’s actually going to be a lot of work, the way we’re planning it, and I hope that won’t scare people off.” Cheng added that the course will include a number of small group discussions that hone members’ conversational techniques. She emphasized that she hopes the forum participants will be able to speak using basic Cantonese upon the forum’s completion. “Even though it’s for beginners, we still want them to leave our forum knowing certain words, being able to at least communicate on a first grade or kindergarten level or something,” Cheng said. Small Scale Agriculture in Theory and in Practice Student Leaders: Anna Redgrave ’16, Catherine Walsh ’16 Faculty Sponsor: Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Science in Society Gillian Goslinga Originally envisioned to launch in its current form last semester, this course was edited to a mostly-theoretical version after it became apparent that a remodeling of Long Lane Farm was necessary in the spring. Now that Long Lane is back in action, the class can combine theoretical work with a practical approach to farming. The theoretical side of the class will start off with readings from Helen and Scott Nearing, a couple who moved from New York to Vermont in 1932 to start their own farm; Wendell Berry, a key agriculture theorist who writes about the dangers of industrial-scale farming; and Eliot Coleman, who wrote “The New Organic Grower,” a practical guide to organic farming. Additional theoretical works will refer back to these texts for an in-depth look at the current state of farming and its possibilities and implications. Walsh commented on the current course’s potential to raise interest in Long Lane within the campus community. According to Walsh, the forum is designed to continue in its current iteration indefinitely, which will give all aspects of the farming process a few more helping hands in the years to come. “Part of the mission of the class is that we want it to be a gateway for people who’ve heard about the farm, maybe are interested in learning more about where their food comes from and growing their own food,” Walsh said."
"Our Pride is a Joke: C’mon ’Murica!","2013-09-12","by Danny Vazquez, Contributing Writer","I’ve been conducting a poll, gauging the level of pride in America amongst the students here on campus on a scale of 1 to 10, 1 being the lowest level of pride in our nation. The results were surprisingly decent. I honestly expected a much more dismal display of a lack of pride and was somewhat pleased with the love for America demonstrated by some of the students here on campus, especially that of one particular freshman, who will remain nameless. When asked to place his level of pride in America on a scale of 1 to 10, this frosh quickly responded with resolute assurance, “11.” The next day, as I was conducting the survey in the common room of my floor in Clark Hall, that frosh was appalled at the uncertainty and hesitation of the other students responding to the survey. After a somewhat contentious back-and-forth discussion amongst the three or four students debating what the question meant, its subjectivity, the nature of national pride and appreciation of other countries and other forms of government, the young patriot blurted out a beauty of a line, amazing both for its sincerity and condemning nature: “The answer to the question is that you shouldn’t even have to think about it.” You might at first conclude that his statement was born of blind patriotism, or worse yet, ignorance. I assure you, however, that this is a bright guy with the mental faculty of an ideal Wesleyan student, an intelligent and independent thinker unafraid to go against the grain. And yes, he is a proud Republican. And no, there’s nothing wrong with that. If there’s anything I respect about the GOP—and there’s a good deal, despite my generally leftist sensibility and upbringing in a working-class community—it is the general sense of American pride members of the party are unashamed to make known to other Americans and to the rest of the world. The passionate Clark freshman, along with many Republicans, has absolutely no qualms about claiming the US of A is the best damn country in the world. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I feel as if that attitude has lost favor and is somehow considered ludicrous or silly or…ignorant. Gasp! That’s the new curse word, the insult levied willy-nilly used these days toward anyone of differing opinion. I find that majority always seems to seek to shush minority opinion, even when that majority is left-leaning and supposedly “open-minded.” In any case, the point I’m making is that our level of national pride is a joke. After averaging the 57 survey responses, the average level of pride came out to be a lukewarm 6.14. It’s better than what I expected from this intellectual college community where much value is placed on questioning norms and conventions, including traditional loyalties. Nonetheless, a 6.14 is not indicative of a strong sense of pride. I know pride when I see it. Just talk to my Cuban grandmother, who, when she was not yet twenty years old, came all alone and with next to no money to this country in the early 1940s, right before Fidel Castro came to power back in Cuba. She came in pursuit of the American Dream, and ultimately she achieved it, working hard at various jobs, marrying my grandfather, and starting a family. And she did it all by pulling herself up by her own bootstraps with the freedom and opportunity this wonderful country afforded her. Do not dare tell her otherwise. You would be challenging the embodiment of the fervent national pride of a bygone generation. You’d also experience the wrath of a sandal-wielding Hispanic-American grandma, but that is an aside. One of the students who responded to the survey via Facebook posted a link to a famous scene from the TV series “The Newsroom” in which a panelist goes on a rant about how America is not the greatest country in the world anymore, much to the shock of everyone in the audience. He brings up alarmingly valid points, citing various statistics regarding America’s relative rank in relation to other countries in various areas from education to health. It is all very dramatic and such, but the scene is indicative of a real phenomenon: educated citizens losing faith in our nation and feeling a certain embarrassment in any display of national pride. Perusing the Internet, one will find many memes, tweets, and articles that satirize southern and/or Republican pride in “’Murica.” National pride has literally become a joke in our country. The predominant, unspoken consensus is that fervently loving America is a tell-tale sign of ignorance and/or bigotry. Essentially, you have to be stupid to love America. In conducting this unofficial survey, an interesting dichotomy between pride and loyalty became apparent. One student I surveyed, Cindy, was the first to explicitly bring up this dynamic. She expressed that she felt “indebted” to the United States for the opportunities available here that she would not have had in the country of her parents, Guatemala. On the other hand she felt dismayed with certain policies of the current government, especially in foreign policy. Recognizing that Cindy is not alone in her sentiments, it is fair to say that many Americans, while feeling some minimal sense of loyalty to the country, suffer a profound disillusionment and subsequent lack of pride in our government and its role in domestic, and most especially, global societal affairs. Though the lack of pride in America and its governmental apparatus is distinguishable from the sense of loyalty to the nation, it is evident that pride and loyalty are not entirely separable. They are helplessly entangled with one another. The lack of national pride inevitably correlates with a lack of loyalty. I can readily say that I myself have been guilty of a lack of American loyalty, and while it may seem trivial, my indiscretion is a common one and points to a larger phenomenon. Young soccer fans across the country choose to root for other nations instead of the United States during the World Cup. (I personally root big time for Spain, the country of my grandparents.) It may seem incredibly trivial, but it is part of a larger dearth of national pride under which lies two fundamental problems: 1) a crisis of identity as brought about by increased globalization, most recently through the emergence of social media, and 2) a disillusionment with current governmental and political affairs. The first dynamic is a fascinating one that applies not simply to the United States but to nations around the globe. It used to be that one identified strongly with his or her immediate community, and cultural and national displacement of individuals was a cause of geographical displacement. It is no longer so simple. Through the magic of the Internet, we are connected beyond borders in an increasingly interactive way that is tearing apart our cultural, national, and regional identities at the seams. How American does the kid who spends most of his free time on the Internet learning about different people from around the world and all sorts of nationally unaffiliated entities, companies, and institutions, not to mention foreign porn flicks, really feel? How could he develop much of a sense of pride with limited engagement in community affairs and such a vivid exposure to life across the continents? Aside from this emerging identity crisis of the individual and his displacement as a result of technology, especially the Internet and social media, another factor contributes to the lack of national pride in America. Painfully ironic and unavoidably true, the biggest cause for the low national self-esteem is education. Just tonight I was discussing the survey question with a few kids in my hall. One of them, Aidan, ranked his level of American pride at a five. When asked why, he mentioned how he had been discussing flaws of democracy in his government class and how dismaying and “depressing” the conversation was for him. It seems the more a person knows about the structure of American government and the more informed they are of its current policies and how they compare to that of other nations, the less prideful they become in the United States. Aidan’s testimonial is a sad commentary on the present state of our nation. We are so divided that management of our nation is forever a point of contention and controversy. Loyalties have increasingly been placed in party, faction, and class, and it seems as if Rome is falling apart, crumbling before our very eyes. Amidst this gloom and doom, all the predictions of the fall of an empire and such, I ask, is it too much to take up pride in our foundational principles and values and come together to restore our nation? I guess what I’ve been driving at here is a plea to do just that. C’mon, ’Murica. Let us remember who we are, a nation of ideals, not a homogenous cultural group or a couple of competing political factions, but rather a place for anyone who believes in the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Regardless of what happens in Syria, let us be proud and loyal to our country, where we have the liberty to feel and express otherwise. Long live the American Revolution!"
"Tour Take 2: Reimagining A Prefrosh Visit","2013-09-25","by Jenny Davis, Staff Writer","Ammar Zafar/Contributing Photographer Ever since wrapping up the college process last year (if memory serves, that included ceremoniously recycling the enormous packets of information that accumulated in my desk drawer over the previous two years), I’ve tried to block out the trivia-packed tours, tedious information sessions, and awkward interviews of my past. But when I walked into the Office of Admission this Wednesday posing as a prospective student, it all came rushing back. The business casual. The hefty course catalogues on display. The quiet mood music playing softly in the background. I created a high-school alias and filled out a small blue card, and then my tour was off. It was a quiet day, and I was the only “pre-frosh.” What follows is a sub-textual, unofficial transcript of my “campus visit.” Are you here for the 3:00 tour? Yeah, no problem, the tour will start in a few minutes. Go ahead—take a look at the pamphlets and information sheets artfully arranged on the mahogany table. While you’re at it, have some water and make yourself comfortable. Here at Wesleyan, we’re really into water. And comfort. Oh, and fill out one of these blue cards—it’s just so we can keep track of your information. [Prospective Student Barbara Bass. High School X, Class of 2014.] This will be more of a conversation, since it’s only the two of us—yeah, I also thought that the tense-looking girl in the skirt suit and clogs might be here for the tour, but it turned out she’s just having an interview. I guess I should start by telling you a little bit about myself. I’m a major in two impressive things, and I’m also a member of four sports clubs and three publications here on campus. Right now we’re walking through the Center for the Arts—we affectionately refer to it as the CFA—and I know it looks like LEGO buildings, but you’ll grow to love it. I think that something like 40 percent of graduates have taken dance classes. We have a real spirit of inclusivity here at Wesleyan. Me? No, I’ve never taken a dance class, but one of my friends was in West African Dance last semester. She said it was amazing. Right now we’re crossing Wyllys Avenue—the cars always stop for pedestrians here; everyone is so friendly—and we’ll be continuing along College Row. This is where the class deans’ offices are. They’re here to be leaders, counselors, and even parental figures. One of my friends was really sick one semester and missed a bunch of work. So she met with her dean to make a game plan for catching up. When she went back at her dorm room later that night, there was a care package with chicken soup and tea waiting for her. [Meaningful pause.] On to standard academic details. The average class size is 19, though there are often fewer students in classes. Because of the open curriculum and lack of formal distribution requirements, one can be assured that each of the other 18 students in hir class is enthusiastic about being there. We have nine hundred courses each semester and 44 majors, and 100 percent of classes are taught by professors. They really just want to get to know you and know what makes you tick. Here at Wesleyan, our professors won’t only take you out for fair-trade coffee; they’ll bake you seitan hash in a pit in their backyard. The Memorial Chapel hasn’t been affiliated with any particular religious organization since 1911, when the University broke from the Methodist Church. Now, the Chapel’s biggest event is Wesleyan Thinks Big. It’s like our version of TED Talks. Judd Hall was the first building at Wesleyan devoted to undergraduate research. Yeah, it’s pretty, right? It’s a symbol of continuing education here at Wesleyan. A funny story, actually: Professor Atwater was working in the basement of Judd Hall, trying to determine the nutritional content of beer. In doing this, he actually stumbled upon the discovery of the food calorie. So when you’re eating something and see the calorie content, you have Wesleyan’s own Professor Atwater to thank—or blame. [Pause for laughter.] Now seems like a good time to mention our engagement with the Middletown Community because I hear sirens, and you might be getting nervous. You might have noticed that Wesleyan is an open campus, with no gates or fences. Middletown residents can be seen walking their dogs, taking advantage of the open gym hours, or attending performances at the CFA. Now we’re passing by Allbritton—yeah, isn’t it pretty?—and heading up toward Olin. It’s got 1.3 million physical volumes, but if that’s not enough reading material for you, we have an interlibrary loan system with Trinity College in Hartford and Connecticut College down in New London. No, actually, the library isn’t open 24 hours because, as I was saying, it’s really important here to get out, get to know your classmates, or get involved with Middletown. This is Exley, the science center. Wesleyan is considered one of the best, if not the best, liberal arts colleges in science. And that’s because of our 300 graduate students: we’re eligible for research grants, but because they’re so few in number, many of those resources trickle down. If calculus makes you want to break out in hives, you can take advantage of our science and math courses for non-majors. Over there? That’s Pi Café. I really think they should start selling pie for three dollars and 14 cents, just as a novelty item—it’s a lot for a piece of pie, but I’d buy it. Here are the senior houses. As a rule of thumb, anything with a red door is Wesleyan-owned. Look, this is really nice: it’s like living in a little Wesleyan suburbia, only without the SUVs and labradoodles. When did Wesleyan go co-ed? That’s actually a funny story—and I’m prepared to acknowledge and honor it in order to move past it. We were originally co-ed—it was “Wesleyan’s Great Experiment”—but started excluding women in 1911. People say the women were making the men look bad. When you go into Freeman, you see the pictures on the walls of all the teams, right? Up until the 1970s, when we started admitting women, everybody’s scowling. In the 1970s, everybody’s happy! Hey, you, walking out of Bennet: Could you possibly let us in? Someone was supposed to give me a key card, but either they didn’t put it back, or—oh, you have to get to football practice. No problem. We’ll see if someone on the other side can help us. I’ll keep talking breezily so we can pretend that didn’t happen. People here at Wesleyan are just so friendly. We’ll just pass briefly by the observatory. Amherst built theirs a few years before we did, and because we’re so mature, when we built ours we made the telescopes two inches bigger. That’s an oft-overlooked method to choose a college: by telescope size. Oh, so yeah, this is Foss Hill. Right now it’s Foss weather, so you’ll see a lot of people reading or napping out here. Once I saw a guy roll up the hill. It was actually pretty impressive—and in the spirit of fun, of course. No illegal substances were involved, because here at Wesleyan we respect Connecticut state law. I’ll invite you to fill out one of the cards once we get back to the Admissions office. If you liked the tour, again my name is Tour Guide, and if you didn’t like the tour, my name is Other Tour Guide. [Pause for laughter.] Thanks so much for visiting with us. Best of luck in the college process."
"Pumpkin Fest Welcomes Autumn, Fosters Community","2013-10-09","by Jenny Davis, Staff Writer","Trisha Arora/Photo Editor Laura Cohen ’14, in overalls and braids, walked over to the long line of people waiting for free veggie burgers. “Marigolds?” she offered, and began passing out fresh yellow flowers. This Saturday, Long Lane Farm was milling with people attending its annual Pumpkin Fest. Elderly folks nodded along to the banjo tunes coming from the stage, young children wandered from stand to stand, and students snapped pictures at booths and stomped in the just-fallen leaves. Cohen was selling homemade baked goods, from whole-wheat bread with honey to slices of pumpkin pie, among other treats. “It’s awesome!” she said. “There are so many people from the community, kids, and professors here. There are great vibes.” Not even wasps could dampen the mood. “I bought homemade bread with apple jam, and it was really funny because there were wasps flying absolutely everywhere,” said Anastasia Almyasheva ’17. “The man putting jam onto my bread had wasps all over him, but he didn’t even care.” Almyasheva enjoyed visiting the other booths as well, which sold everything from smoothies to spices. “It was a good opportunity to try some of the farm’s produce,” she said. “The spice section was really cool, and I loved the crafts that they had. There were also a lot of little kids there, and it was a really joyous atmosphere.” Coady Johnson ’15 and Kate Enright ’15, along with other co-organizers, had been planning Pumpkin Fest since August; both spent the summer working on the farm. “Valerie Marinelli of the College of the Environment approached the group of students who were staying at Wesleyan and asked if any of us would like to volunteer to help plan the Pumpkin Fest,” Johnson said. “This was actually only my second Pumpkin Fest, since it was snowed out my freshman year due to the infamous Snowpocalypse.” Enright, who spearheaded the crafts and bake sales, was overjoyed with the feedback from visitors to the farm on Saturday. “I was mostly really happy with people’s reactions,” she said. “People said it was one of the most positive things they’d experienced at Wesleyan, which was a big deal.” Various environmental clubs, including the Climate Ambassadors, took advantage of Pumpkin Fest to set up booths informing the community about their work. Aly Raboff ’16, one of three student leaders of the Ambassadors, manned her station with the help of two small children from Middletown who sat on her table alternately drinking smoothies and asking questions. “We just started last semester,” Raboff said. “We’re here to talk about our group, and we have a little quiz going to get people interested.” A representative from Raw You-niverse, a Middletown organic food store, was serving up signature smoothies at a booth near the stage where bands were playing. “They asked us to come last year for the first time, and it was so much fun that we had to come back,” said Larry, the smoothie mixer. The sound of whirring blenders was just background noise to the bands performing on the central stage. The first to perform were the Highlanders, a folk group featuring Vice President for Finance and Administration John Meerts. “I’ve have a band on campus for the past 11 or 12 years,” Meerts said. “This is the latest incarnation. I play guitar, harmonica, and orchestrate with my feet. I also do vocals.” This was Meerts’ first Pumpkin Fest. “I like the farm, and I’m very engaged with it in my official capacity,” he said. “When there was a call out for people to perform, my group and I thought it might be fun.” And fun it was—even for those in charge. Though he was flipping free veggie burgers and painting faces for most of the day, Johnson was happy to observe the Fest. “It seemed like everyone was really enjoying themselves,” Johnson said. “My favorite part was seeing the kids from the Middletown Food Project [MFP]. MFP was a program we organized over the summer for families who had kids on the free lunch program at the Snow School….We all really bonded a lot, and it was great to see them at Pumpkin Fest with other people from their neighborhood, since it really is supposed to be open to everyone and not just people from Wesleyan.” Enright agreed that observing the community engagement was her favorite part of the Fest. “We all had these kids that we made friends with this summer,” she said. “It was great to see them at the Fest, having a lot of fun just being on the farm.”"
"Community Group Branches Out With Middletown Garden Initiatives","2013-10-10","by Gabe Rosenberg, Assistant Features Editor","Xinyu Zhu/Contributing Photographer Behind Macdonough Elementary School in Middletown, a garden grows: leafy greens, bell peppers, tatsoi, sunflowers, and strawberries fill the space. Of course, this garden didn’t spring up from nowhere; it resulted from a collaboration among the University’s Middletown Urban GARDENS (MUG) group, the North End Action Team (NEAT), and the elementary school’s students and teachers. “We built a community garden behind Macdonough, took the children out there, got them involved in actually planting, watering, and tending to growing plants there, taught them a little about the lifecycle of plants, and exposed them to healthy food,” said James Carter ’14. By establishing community gardens at local elementary schools and in the north end of Middletown, MUG aims to promote nutritional education and foster a sense of community through the use of shared, sustainable space. After finishing a stint with AmeriCorps, Adin Vaewsorn ’15 wanted to focus his knowledge about community engagement into an effort to improve local relations between the University and the wider community. To this end, he and a few others decided on the goals of GARDENS, which stands for “Generating Agricultural Resources and Delivering Education on Nutrition in Schools.” Pierre Gerard/Contributing Photographer The idea of garden-based nutrition education, Vaewsorn said, fulfilled more than just one of his goals as a University student. “[It] was a thing I found I had a passion for, and I thought it would help establish relations between Wesleyan and Middletown,” he said. “It was a win-win in my mind.” In 2011, Vaewsorn spotted an empty lot on Ferry Street that was owned by a housing corporation but not in use at the time. NEAT, a grassroots community organization that had already built a successful community garden on Erin Street, had also been eyeing the lot as the location for a new public space. “It wasn’t the prettiest thing to look at, but it looked like a place that had so much potential,” Vaewsorn said. According to Pierre Gerard ’15, the garden also satisfied a need for connection within the incongruent Ferry Street area. Large apartments and the Wharfside Commons development, which consists of high-density residences with large turnover rates, surrounds the garden. “[We wanted to] create a space that people who are constantly coming and going can hold onto while they’re there,” Gerard said. NEAT acquired the property, and MUG provided the muscle to make some changes. According to Janika Oza ’15, the group cleaned up the trash, moved the rocks, used a brush mower to clear the five-foot-high weeds, and replaced the lead-laden soil with a healthy mulch of manure, woodchips, and cardboard. As for what to do with the space, MUG asked the community, believing that those who benefit most from shared spaces should have the final say in their use. Members of the group went door-to-door asking if households were interested in owning sections of the garden, and, if so, what they wanted to grow. “It was the kids who made the decisions,” Vaewsorn said. “They were very excited about their vegetables.” MUG then supplied the plants, receiving donations of discounted or free seeds from local stores. The resulting area is a mix of individually owned and managed plots, all of which are currently occupied, and a common area of four beds open to public consumption, which Middletown gardeners volunteer to maintain. The support of NEAT, which has a strong relationship with Middletown, proved instrumental to the involvement of North End residents in the project. “With an emphasis upon democratic neighborhood leadership and community coalition building on an issue-by-issue basis, NEAT has developed successful programs and initiatives aimed at responsible revitalization and has become a grassroots community organization dedicated to the development of indigenous participation and leadership within the North End neighborhood,” wrote NEAT Executive director Bobbye Peterson in an email to the Argus. The team was formed in 1997 in response to the area’s broad disinvestment, neighborhood violence, and widespread poverty, Peterson noted. NEAT makes its greatest impact in providing affordable housing redevelopments, and its experience with promoting public spaces made the garden project more doable. “[NEAT is] the pillar of support in the community that makes this possible,” Vaewsorn said. To further the impact of its nutritional efforts, however, the group makes sure to engage the children of local families in the gardening process. Carter said the elementary school program, which will move from Macdonough to Wilbert Snow Elementary School this semester, provides a necessary resource to students of low socioeconomic status. At Macdonough especially, a large fraction of students receive free or reduced lunches, so the garden supplements their nutritional education. “The quality of the food they’re experiencing at school and at home is fairly low,” Carter said. “A lot of the children don’t have exposure to vegetables in many forms, so we’ve actually harvested food from the garden there that they’ve planted and showed them how to cook it.  We had a little stir fry.” Carter has been working with the administration at Snow to set up a curriculum, with lessons about nutrition labels and the values of different processed foods complementing the garden-based activities. At Macdonough, Carter found, the children responded best to hands-on approaches to learning, and the garden fueled their excitement for learning about and caring for plants. “They really like to get out there and run around through the garden,” Carter said. “For whatever reason, watering became the highlight activity for them; watering and eating, mostly.” Members of MUG said they were inspired by how engaged community members became in their newly created space. “I was most impressed by how much the gardeners cared about the garden individually,” Gerard said. The volunteer gardeners acted as community leaders, and once the project got off the ground in May, MUG realized it no longer had to intervene in the day-to-day necessities of watering and caring for the plants and common area. “Our Ferry Street gardeners have more or less taken over the garden,” Carter said. “They’re responsible for running things, and they just let us know if something is not working out well, and we’ll help them with that.” Especially over the summer, Middletown residents provide the bulk of the garden’s continuing operations. “[MUG] opened up the space for them to organize themselves,” Vaewsorn said. The gradual move away from student management further secures the future of the Ferry Street garden and provides encouragement for both MUG and NEAT to search for more abandoned or blighted lots to convert. “Wesleyan students often do not live in Middletown for the entire year and often leave after they graduate, so it is crucial that the Middletown residents involved have a major stake in the project so that it can be sustainable,” wrote Keren Reichler ’16 in an email to the Argus. The elementary school programs prove a greater challenge in terms of sustainability. While the Macdonough garden continues to thrive, without the involvement of University students, the educational aspects require outside help. “The teachers aren’t paid to do these programs, so we have to show up there and provide the manpower,” Carter said. Now that its roots are planted, MUG plans to branch out. Oza said the group looks to expand its infrastructure by building a small stage or fire pit in the Ferry Street lot. Members also plan to hold more events for the community, including a pickling workshop with the garden’s green tomatoes and a flower-bulb-planting day. And, of course, MUG strives to pinpoint what the community wants for its garden. So far, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. “Everybody loves the idea of something that could bring people in a seemingly disparate area together,” Gerard said."
"Students, Administrators Discuss Role of Money in Education System","2013-10-10","by Matthew Shelley-Reade, Contributing Writer","Lauren Chang/Staff Photographer On Wednesday, Oct. 9, students and administrators participated in a workshop titled “Does Money Buy Education?” The event, led by Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitators (WesDEF) Julie Hsia ’14 and Micaela Kaye ’16, focused on the role a student’s socioeconomic background has on hir education, both in high school and in college. “[We] thought it would be interesting to see how money is involved in the college admissions process, how it is distributed in high schools, and how that creates advantages and disadvantages,” Kaye said. “We also wanted to know how much your socioeconomic background plays a role in the education you receive.” Hsia and Kaye started the workshop by having attendees create a mock high school budget. Students had to allocate funds between faculty salaries, administrative salaries, science, athletics, music and arts, student resources, and building management. After each group shared its budget with the others, the leaders showed a budget used by New York City public schools in 2006. The contrast between budgets perturbed Eric Zepeda ’17, who attended the workshop. “I was surprised to learn how little money is actually allocated to student resources,” Zepeda said. “Without providing students with such basic resources as transportation, it becomes clear why many students fall behind in their studies.” During the next activity, students were given cards assigning them new identities with new social and economic backgrounds, races, classes, sexual orientations, and parents’ education levels. Students were then told to take a step forward for each characteristic deemed favorable by society, such as being able to afford an SAT prep class, and a step backward for those that society considers unfavorable, such as needing to work instead of being able to afford the same prep course. As the students were dispersed by their progressions or regressions, sections were ultimately separated and given acceptance to Wesleyan, a state university, community college, or no university at all. Abel Sandoval ’15 approved of the activity. “I really liked the simulation,” Sandoval said. “It really put into perspective the advantage income has on education. I think the first step in addressing a problem is to…discuss it. Some topics, like class, seem taboo on campus, so it’s important to improve understanding.” The role of money in education is important, specifically in the context of the University. “People have begun to scratch the surface with the financial aid debate,” Hsia said. “Hopefully we can go deeper in this workshop.” Hsia was referring to the University’s transition last year to a financial aid plan that would admit roughly 90 percent of the freshman class on a need-blind basis and 10 percent on a need-aware basis. “Our education is flawed, as it allows unequal access to education,” Kaye said. “This debate is relevant at the University as well. Financial aid doesn’t cover everything here, so there are differences, be it subtle, between classes.” Director of Financial Aid John Gudvangen and Dean for Diversity and Student Engagement Renee Johnson-Thornton also participated in the workshop. Johnson-Thornton said that she was attracted to the workshop for both professional and personal reasons. “I identify as a first-generation college student from a low-income family, so of course I was interested in the topic,” Johnson-Thornton said. “But in a professional sense, I’m constantly talking to students about how money is a barrier at Wesleyan. Students shouldn’t be encountering barriers here.” Johnson-Thornton noted that she values the efforts of groups like WesDEF to raise awareness and create spaces for discussion on these topics. “I appreciate the call for students to start organizations around this issue,” Johnson-Thornton said. “A few years ago, a student group formed around first-generation college students, but it fizzled out after a couple years.” She added that the dialogue was so thought-provoking that the workshop’s end felt abrupt. “For a minute, I couldn’t believe it was over,” she said. “The issue of school options based on class is such an important issue; there’s a lot to talk about. Nonetheless, it was a powerful experience.” Kaye hopes that the workshop will spark future discussion and organizational effort surrounding the issue. “This group is dedicated to creating open dialogue and space on campus to talk about social justice issues,” Kaye said. “If people want to do something after this, it’s important for us to know how we can supplement this course of action and act as a support system.”"
"Back With A Vengeance: Art House Brings Creative Energy To Washington Street","2013-10-14","by Cecilia Cereijido-Bloche, Contributing Writer","Trisha Arora/Photo Editor When the Office of Residential Life (ResLife) sent a message out to students last fall encouraging them to submit proposals for the creation of a new program house, Gabe Gordon ’15 and Genna DeGroot ’15 stepped up. What did they want in the place of Interfaith House? They longed for a re-imagining of the infamous Art House. When they sent the application in for the proposed program house, they labeled it “Studio House.” They feared that calling it Art House would increase its chances of rejection because the former Art House, once located at 69 High Street, was dismantled in 2003. In 2000, The New York Times published an article titled “Naked Dorm? That Wasn’t in the Brochure,” which labeled labeled West College (WestCo) a “naked dorm.” In the article, former Art House manager Michael Bodel ’03 spoke highly of naked parties, a social event for which the house was known. Some students speculate that the house’s affinity for nudity was one of the primary reasons behind its demise. “I don’t know the official reason why, but I know ResLife decided Art House was done,” Gordon, the Art House manager, said. “They lived in this beautiful house, throwing too many parties and causing too much trouble.” After the application for Studio House was accepted, ResLife agreed that it would be a better idea to call it Art House. Art House’s current mission statement on the University’s website is almost identical to the old iteration’s. Both describe the nurturing of a space where all art can be created, displayed, and discussed. Both emphasize the importance of being open-minded and inclusive of art created by anyone on campus. “What I want Art House to be more than anything is a place where people won’t be judged for having ideas,” Gordon wrote in an email to the Argus. “I know I often struggle with finding the confidence to take hold of the creative thoughts I come across, act on them, and put them to life….The Art House community, by being supportive of the work of each other, fosters the initiative to act on creative impulse.” So far, the new iteration of Art House has been a widespread success in attracting students with varied interests. Gordon described the current residents as a diverse collective of students. “We are NOT a house full of Art majors,” he wrote. “We are filmmakers, musicians, dancers, writers, actors, marine biologists, etc.” Art House has already had numerous social events that have established its place within the broader campus community. At its first concert, the Housewarming Show on Sept. 14, student performances included an improv-folk group, a funk-rap band, and a Beatles cover band. Since then, Art House has hosted several other artists. On Oct. 5, they welcomed Lust-Cats of the Gutters, an indie band from Brooklyn, Mannequin Pussy, a Denver-based fuzz-punk band, and a student duo called The Murdertones. Though concerts are clearly a large part of the house’s focus, its residents strive to present a wider variety of the arts, and even to combine them. Gordon hopes that people will come for the concerts and be drawn in to the Art House community by the visual art on display. The first floor is still decorated with art from the Housewarming Show in September, which drew from campus-wide submissions. In addition to student art, residents of Art House hang cat images up on the walls whenever a resident has achieved anything, whether it be a social or academic accomplishment. Art House’s mission to wrap students into a creative haven extends beyond nightlife. Residents use the house as a rehearsal space, and Gordon hopes to hold a short play series there in the future. This past weekend, Art House hosted a 24-hour comic book marathon during which paper and drawing supplies were provided for anyone who wanted to create comics. Finally, contributors created one big comic that its contributors hope to show to the rest of the student body. The house also hosted an event where students were invited to draw nude models. Beyond mixing with other students and planning events with other houses, members of Art House have demonstrated a desire to mix with the world beyond the University. Gordon has plans for the house to participate in outreach programs and host guest speakers. “Community engagement through art is one of the biggest elements of our mission, so we are definitely going to be reaching out around campus and Middletown to get projects going in that direction,” Gordon wrote. “Our amazing faculty advisor is Kate TenEyck, the Art Department’s Studio Technician and professor. She is heavily involved in Wesleyan and Middletown’s art scenes and is an amazing resource.” It’s clear that the revived Art House has its hopes to be a friendly and welcoming environment for people of all persuasions, removed from the older iteration’s rowdy reputation. “While Art House likes to make noise (through our concerts and performances, gatherings, laughter), we consider ourself a safe and comfortable space,” Gordon wrote. “The building is large and shared with Lighthouse, but it feels like a home to both groups.”"
"Office of Community Engagement Plans Alternative Spring Break","2013-10-30","by Courtney Laermer, Staff Writer","Beginning this year, the University and the Office of Community Engagement will offer two alternative spring break (ASB) options for students. Students that are are unable to return home or who are simply interested in the programs will be able to participate in a community service trip through Habitat for Humanity or to engage in local community service in the Middletown community. The ASB program will be sponsored by the University and will seek to encourage community engagement. The main organizer of the program, Bruno Machiavelo Tinoco ’16, explained that when he recognized that the University did not have any ASB programs, he was determined to help create one. Machiavelo Tinoco, who serves on the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) Student Affairs Committee, published a committee update on the WSA website on Oct. 14 explaining the program. “Unfortunately, Wesleyan does not have any institutionalized, recurring, and consistent ASB program,” Machiavelo Tinoco wrote. “So, I did what any WSA member would do: I set out to change this. After many meetings with relevant administrators and students, Wesleyan’s ASB program was born.” Machiavelo Tinoco added that these options will be especially beneficial for international students, for whom it is particularly difficult to leave campus. “As a previously international student, I had a lot of trouble finding things to do during school breaks while others were off gallivanting around the United States and/or visiting home,” Machiavelo Tinoco wrote. “This was especially true during spring break, especially due to the fact that we have two whole weeks off. Through talking with a lot of my international friends that now attend American universities, I learned that a lot of them were participating in their school’s ‘Alternative Spring Break’ program.” A survey provided by the WSA indicated that many students at the University, both international and domestic, expressed interest in having these sorts of alternative spring break options. For student groups whose mission would benefit from a trip that would be difficult to schedule while school is in session, spring break also provides an excellent opportunity. Vice President for Student Affairs Michael Whaley expressed his excitement about the program. “I am fully supportive of offering some service options to students interested in spending a portion of the recess working on community service projects,” Whaley wrote in an email to The Argus. Coordinator for the on-campus chapter of Habitat for Humanity Alex Drexler ’16 said that he has been planning to organize a trip for Habitat for Humanity since his freshman year. According to Drexler, the details for this trip are still being finalized, but the trip’s itinerary will entail working on building a specific house from Monday to Thursday and then having time off on Friday and Saturday to explore the area. “It is very open,” he said. “It is going to depend on who ends up wanting to go, how many people we have, and how far we are willing to travel.” As for the domestic alternative spring break program, students are organizing a one-week program through the Hunger and Homelessness student group. Group leader Francesca Moree ’14 explained that students who choose to attend this will remain on campus throughout spring break. “Time is long overdue for Wesleyan students to engage in an alternative spring break,” Moree wrote in a message to The Argus. Students who choose this trip will either work on various projects in Middletown or select one larger project to complete throughout the week. Machiavelo Tinoco is hopeful that ASB will prove as popular as the WSA survey suggested it might be. “Personally, I think that students will [take advantage of the program], especially international students,” Machiavelo Tinoco said. “I probably would have gone on an alternative spring break trip if it had been available.” In the future, ASB may not be limited to the two options available this year: Drexler hopes this program will grow over the years, possibly offering a larger array of alternative trips to students. “As far as Alternative Spring Break trips go as a whole, I am really excited about getting more of them put together,” Drexler said. Machiavelo Tinoco added that this trip provides a unique opportunity for many students at the University to get involved with the Middletown community as well as communities elsewhere. “Hopefully we get a good turnout and the trip is successful, fun, and very beneficial for the community,” Machiavelo Tinoco said."
"The Challenges of Dissent, The Importance of Dialogue, and The Israeli-Palestinian Conflict","2013-10-30","by Danny Blinderman, Staff Writer","Several weeks ago, I stepped into the Chapel to hear a lecture by Aharon Barak, former President of Israel’s Supreme Court. I was taken aback when I saw a protester holding a sign decrying Wesleyan’s decision to bring him to campus. Indeed, as a student who wishes to engage with different ideas, this message struck me as unhelpful to the goal of fostering understanding and seeking an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The reaction to Wesleyan’s decision to invite Justice Barak to deliver the 23rd annual Hugo L. Black Lecture reminded me of the importance of critical engagement. As the President of Israel’s Supreme Court, he authored scores of decisions that established him as a leading voice for equality and democracy, including a landmark case that outlawed discrimination in housing and residency by nationality. Barak is seen by many to be a leading judicial voice against the rightward shift in Israeli politics. As part of its protest of the event, Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) argued that Wesleyan should never have brought Justice Barak to speak in the first place, with the justification that he is a part of an Israeli political system that the group opposes overall. Excluding his voice, however, would hurt the interests of all Wesleyan students. The call to diminish the breadth and scope of dialogue and engagement on our campus is harmful to the educational mission of the University. While I disagree with much of the content of the protests themselves, their attempt to bring marginalized ideas and issues to the forefront is a vitally important and productive exercise. As someone who attended the lecture, I wish even more of the SJP members had attended the talk and asked the sort of difficult, challenging questions that a figure like Justice Barak deserves to be asked. I wish he had been pushed to answer whether and how international law is applied in the West Bank. I had many friends and acquaintances ask me about the protests and the ramifications of the points the protestors made. Students learned something, and they had the opportunity to think critically about both the lecture and the protest, neither of which would have been possible had Wesleyan bowed to SJP’s original demands. At the end of the day Justice Barak’s voice on campus and SJP’s voice challenging him were both valuable to the conversation. This is why SJP’s demand that Wesleyan should never have brought Barak in the first place is so puzzling. What SJP seemingly failed to realize is that if Wesleyan had not invited Justice Barak to our campus, there could have been no dissenting voices and no space created for a critical examination of the issues at hand. There would have been no chance to engage the campus and wider community in dialogue, no chance to ask critical questions, and no opportunity for students to learn something new. Ideas that we find disagreeable inspire frustration and anger not because they have been voiced, but rather because of the reality to which they give voice. We need to be having a conversation about how we can end the occupation, extend democratic rights and security to inhabitants of both Israel and Palestine, and implement the two-state solution. If Justice Barak had not spoken on campus as per SJP’s original demand, this rich conversation about the many challenges that Israelis and Palestinians face would not have been sparked. We need more conversations about the tough issues surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not fewer. The persistent aversion to engaging in dialogue with individuals and groups we find problematic is symptomatic of a wider malaise that afflicts the politics surrounding the conflict. Many advocate for a type of politics that foreswears dialogue and negotiation unless one side has already acceded to the other’s position. This sort of politics results in an echo chamber, one where we can hear ourselves perfectly clear but are no closer to solving the difficult issues at hand. Years of non-negotiation brought us no closer to resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The result has been perennial insecurity for Israelis and continuing occupation for Palestinians. It is negotiation that has given Israelis and Palestinians a chance for peace, democracy, and self-determination. The resumption of negotiations with the help of Secretary John Kerry has shown once again the power of negotiations over boycotts and sanctions. This is why I believe J Street U’s work on campus to be so crucial: it creates the space to grapple with the issues surrounding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and provides opportunities to advocate for vigorous U.S. leadership to reach a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. As a member of the group, I invite everyone to join us in our campaign to make the two-state solution a political reality. If we want to encourage an open and critical discussion on our campus, we need to engage with the most diverse set of voices possible, no matter how challenging they may be. We need Israeli figures such as Justice Barak, Palestinian activists and leaders, Israeli civil society organizations like Breaking the Silence, and leading American policy makers. It is through dialogue, education, and agitation that we learn about the issues that need our redress and attention. Dialogue opens the space for us to understand the problem, formulate a response, and engage our leaders in an effort to end this enduring conflict. Blinderman is a member of the class of 2014."
"Middletown Potluck Bridges Community Through Social Events","2013-11-04","by Kirsten Rischert-Garcia,","“Freshman year, I spent a lot of time in the triangle between my dorm room, Usdan, and the library,” said Ari Ebstein ’16. “When you’re in that loop, it all feels very significant, [but] what does my paper on popular culture and social justice really mean when people are homeless and sleeping on the street in Middletown?” Ebstein and Bulelani “Jills” Jili ’16 began thinking about how to make social change a more constant part of their lives while they were living in 200 Church last year. In the spring, they worked together to form Middletown Potluck with the goal of strengthening ties between Wesleyan students and Middletown residents. The potlucks have been held in partnership with the Green Street Arts Center and aim to facilitate fruitful conversations about social justice over a shared meal. “Wesleyan students are a tad aloof, a bit in our own world,” Jili said. “When you converse, [you might hear], ‘I’m going into Middletown.’ You are in Middletown.” Evan Bieder ’15 agrees that Wesleyan students tend to detach themselves from the greater community. He has tried to combat this issue through volunteering with Middletown Potluck, Food Not Bombs, and Middletown Urban Gardens. “I think a lot of Wesleyan students can get stuck in the Wesleyan bubble and only really experience Middletown on Main Street through the restaurants and frozen yogurt and things like that,” Bieder said. “I am trying to make a bigger effort to interact with the town I am living in for four years.” Efforts to strengthen the relationship between Wesleyan and Middletown have also been increasing on an institutional level. For example, this September, the University hosted its inaugural celebration of Middletown Day, which brought members of the Middletown community to the Wesleyan campus for an afternoon of festivities. It is up for debate, however, whether or not these efforts have been successful at reducing town-gown tensions. “When people talk about tension, we talk about the idea that we have this very wealthy, privileged institution, literally on an elevated landscape, that employs a lot of the greater community as kind of a service class, sometimes in serviceable working conditions and sometimes not, and often [Wesleyan] is criticized for not engaging in more partnership with the community,” Ebstein said. “I think a lot of the activism Wesleyan touts about itself and [which] students engage in is of a paternalistic nature, such as tutoring or food rescue. These things are important, and I’m not trying to criticize these things unilaterally, but they do come from a hierarchical position of Wesleyan as this bastion of privilege and abundance.” Ebstein and Jili said they are making an effort to go about social activism in less paternalistic and hierarchical ways and to involve the Middletown community as much as possible in the decision-making process. In fact, it was Middletown resident Nur Moebius who came up with the idea of having a potluck while talking to Ebstein at a celebratory barbeque for Middletown Urban Gardens. Moebius was one of three speakers at the Middletown Potluck’s first event, “The Middletown Experience,” along with Arthur Moore, a ninth grade student with an interest in spoken word, and Jalen Alexander ’14, coordinator for the Traverse Square tutoring program. “Middletown Potluck is unique in that its focus is social,” Jili said. “We are a group of equals trying to come [together] to make a change.” The Halloween Bash, held at Green Street Arts Center on Oct. 27 and co-sponsored by Middletown Potluck and Green Street, was originally suggested by Middletown resident and parent Beverly Morris. More than 50 children came to the event, and 7 Wesleyan students helped out with the various activities on the schedule, including finger painting and drawing, a freeze dance game, and a chocolate mud-pie station that introduced kids to the idea of composting. One highlight of the night was the haunted house, decorated by After School Supervisor at Green Street Cookie Quiñones. “We are trying to see if next year we can make it even bigger,” Quiñones said. “We want to hear the voices of the community, and we will try our best to make [what they want] happen.” Middletown parent Marilyn Dunkley attended the Halloween event with her kids and plans to attend Middletown Potluck’s next event on Saturday, Nov. 16, from 5 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at First Church, 190 Court St. This potluck will be in collaboration with St. Vincent de Paul’s Amazing Grace Food Pantry and will feature speeches from several formerly or currently homeless people as a way to fuel a discussion on hunger and homelessness in the Middletown community. “We were hit by the economy and layoffs,” Dunkley said. “I have six kids and we go to Amazing Grace [Food Pantry] to get assistance. Middletown is very unique; we are all connected and [people are] willing to help out whenever you need something.” Although Green Street-affiliated families made up the largest portion of “Halloween Bash” attendees, an eclectic mix of people typically attends Middletown Potluck events. Attendees include homeless people from the Eddy Shelter, Wesleyan students, an old-school Marxist named Vick, Green Street administrators, and Middlesex Community College students. Lately, Ebstein and Jili have been reaching out to more faith-based communities and are also trying to encourage more professors to attend and to contribute food to the potluck. “One problem is that we are feeding more of a food-insecure population… [and it could be] offensive to expect a resident of the Eddy shelter to bring food, so we’ve been dimming the potluck aspect,” Ebstein said. So far, Wesleyan students have cooked most of the meals, with Middletown residents contributing several dishes and Mike’s Deli providing sandwiches on occasion. Ebstein hopes to get more restaurants to agree to donate food, one of many goals he has for the future of Middletown Potluck. “I would like to get involved in a local issue of social justice, and use the community facilitated by Middletown Potluck to help out in a significant way in providing partial solutions to issues pertaining to social justice,” Ebstein said. “Whether that is homeless[ness], food insecurity, or educational inequity, they are all part of the same soup.”"
"Students and Parents Attend Annual COE Symposium","2013-11-04","by Hilary Brumberg, Contributing Writer","On Saturday, Nov. 2, the College of the Environment (COE) held its annual symposium, “Where on Earth are We Going?”, which featured guest lecturer Deborah Bird Rose and Distinguished Visiting Scholar in the College of the Environment Frédérique Apffel-Marglin ’66. Bird Rose gave a lecture titled “Kinship with Nature in the Time of Loss: Can Animism Help Revitalize the Commons?”, while Frédérique Apffel-Marglin’s lecture was called “Re-imagining the Commons: Natural Resource Management or Biocultural Generation?” Each symposium focuses on that year’s COE Think Tank topic. Director of the College of the Environment and Chair of the Environmental Studies Program Barry Chernoff spoke about the importance of this symposium. “We’ve had very impressive speakers over the years,” Chernoff said. “It is important for our students to get exposed to leading speakers in the environmental field and exposed to unique, cutting-edge voices from outside Wesleyan. It gives our students a chance to test ideas and learn different points of view, even if they disagree. We want our students to engage in the critical issues of our time.” The COE holds “Where on Earth are We Going?” over Homecoming/Family Weekend so that parents and alumni can attend the event as well as students. Chernoff commented on the diverse nature of the symposium’s sponsors, which include the Baldwin University Lectures, the Mellon Fund for Lectures, the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, the Science in Society Program, the Animal Studies Reading Group, Center for the Americas, the Anthropology Department, and the History Department. “The amount of groups and departments sponsoring the event shows that the issues we’re dealing with really affect a lot of people at the university,” Chernoff said. Bird Rose’s talk focused on how her work with Aboriginal people has helped her better understand animism, which she defined as humans’ relationship with all natural objects, including plants, animals, rivers and rocks. “Animism can help us to revitalize our capacity to understand ourselves and our place in the world to restore us to a sense of humanity,” she said. She explained that animism makes life meaningful because it allows people to realize that birds have ceremonies of their own and plants have their own cultures and kinships. “What does it take to live in a culture where other beings are bumping up against you?” Bird Rose asked. “You’re not bumping up against inanimate objects.” She told the story of Australian porcupine hunter, Snowy Kulmilya, who uses a boomerang to slay porcupines. He sees porcupines as intelligent, tricky beings, and consequently talks to them when he hunts them. “You need to acknowledge the multiple knowledges in the universe,” Rose said. “Where the human knowledge stops is not the end of knowledge.” Commenting on the topic of this year’s Think Tank, Bird Rose explained that the entire biosphere is a common space, shared by all. “There should not be property questions, but belonging questions,” she said. “We belong to it; it doesn’t belong to us. It isn’t ours to trash and throw away.” After her lecture, Bird Rose explained why it is important for young people, like University students, to learn about issues such as animism and the commons. “You’re the ones who will have to live through a world of tough changes,” Bird Rose said. “You need inspiration and resources and an awareness of a diverse human experience.” Apffel-Marglin spoke in front of a photograph of the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration, which she founded in 2009, in the Peruvian High Amazon. She analyzed the word biocultural, which comprises the roots for the words nature and humanity. “Nature and humans are always entangled,” she said. Apffel-Marglin showed a short video clip of two boys in Bolivia praying to and discussing the merits of El Tio, who is said to protect miners and eat men. She also explained the idea of moral economy, which, she stated, is humans’ responsibility to the nonhuman world. After her lecture, Apffel-Marglin explained that her goal is to motivate young people to take action. “Thinking is great, but not sufficient,” she said. “If people only do with their minds and don’t connect learning with activities, it’s very problematic.” Apffel-Marglin’s suggested that one remedy to this problem for University students is to work on Long Lane Farm and do other activities with real-world applications. “Long Lane Farm shouldn’t be an elective or a side thing; it should be incorporated into the curriculum,” she said. “There are some community engagement courses, but they are few and far between. Courses should have a hands-on aspect.” Ross Levin ’15 said that he enjoyed Apffel-Marglin’s presentation. “She was able to make connections between types of knowledge and how people relate to each other,” Levin said. “It was exciting that there is a new type of economy, which is at the center of what Frédérique was talking about.”"
"Students, WesDEFs Address Issues in Wesleyan-Middletown Relations","2013-11-07","by Madeleine Stern, Contributing Writer","Students gathered in 41 Wyllys on Wednesday, Nov. 6 for an open forum about the relationship between the University and the greater Middletown community. Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitators (WesDEFs) Keren Reichler ’16, Alexandra Ricks ’16, and Janika Oza ’15 facilitated the forum, which was informally titled “Us and Them.” Oza did not identify any specific events as part of WesDEF’s motivation for organizing the forum, pointing instead to a more general need to open a conversation about the Wesleyan-Middletown relationship. “During orientation we were coming up with possible topics to address this year, and this came up as something that was definitely worth discussing,” Oza said. Reichler added that she, Ricks, and Oza each has a personal interest in the topic. “This was important for us because [the three of us] all work, volunteer, or are otherwise engaged with the wider community in some way,” Reichler said. The forum drew about 25 students, many of whom are also involved with community engagement initiatives on campus. To begin the meeting, facilitators asked attendees to ponder the roots of any animosity between students and Middletown residents. Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Catherine Lechowicz attributed the rift in part to a lack of understanding of the Office of Public Safety’s jurisdiction on campus. “[There are] potentially unstated policies about how people, either Public Safety or others, have approached people on campus,” Lechowicz said. “Incidents don’t always involve town people; sometimes they’re student-on-student. They’re just part of society. It’s a difficult question, then, of ensuring that campus resources are available to everyone in the community while maintaining a safe campus.” Another subject of discussion was the University’s campus climate;  students generally agreed that there is room for improvement. A common point of concern was the attitude that many students hold toward Middletown and its residents. “It seems to me more and more that there are barriers within the student body itself,” said Shira Engel ’14, who heads the Woodrow Wilson Tutoring Partnership. Adin Vaewsorn ’15 agreed that the way many University students conceive of their relationships with the city around them could stand to improve. “Students tend to primarily have service-based interactions with Middletown,” Vaewsorn said. “[Engaging with the community] tends to become less of a process and more one-sided.” Abel Sandoval ’15 echoed Vaewsorn’s sentiments. “Whether it’s from in the community or from outside, [University students] are viewed as being in an elite position,” Sandoval said. “Sometimes I feel like I’m being put on a pedestal…but I would say a lot of Wesleyan students view themselves that way as well.” Ari Ebstein ’16 speculated that the topography of the University and the surrounding community contributes to these perceptions. “Since we’re up here on this hill, sometimes it’s sort of this attitude of, ‘We’re up here, and they’re down there,’” Ebstein said. However, participants in the forum expressed hope for improved town-gown relations. Engel reflected on her own perception of Middletown over the course of her time at the University. “Since my freshman year, Middletown, in my mind, has become so much larger,” Engel said. “I’ve realized that I was defining ‘city’ in such a limited, limiting way…. There’s definitely a lack of awareness. People who don’t necessarily work with populations outside of Wesleyan are exactly the people who need to be exposed to this kind of discussion.” “We tend to forget…but there’s a whole other world out there, and there’s so much happening,” she said. Ebstein offered up a simple but surprising tip for students. “A year or two ago, [Wesleyan] did a survey where they asked Middletown residents, ‘What’s the number one thing Wesleyan students could do to improve their relationship with Middletown?’” he said. “You know what the answer was? Crosswalks. We need to use the crosswalks around campus.”"
"F-Holes String Together Musical Efforts","2013-11-14","by Claire Bradach, Executive Editor","This Saturday, Nov. 16 at 3 p.m., a student-run group that describes itself as the chamber orchestra equivalent of an a cappella group will have its debut performance in the Olin lobby. The F Holes, a seven-member string group named after the f-shaped hole in string instruments that helps them produce sound, started playing this semester and has already achieved a high level of musical nuance. Although some instrumentalists had been discussing the possibility of a student-run chamber orchestra since last year, Matthew Stein ’16 was primarily responsible for organizing the interested students and realizing the goal. Many of the members of The F Holes met playing in the Wesleyan University Orchestra or University-run quartets, but they wanted an opportunity to play in a self-organized environment. “A lot of the people who were really passionate about chamber experience and have a lot of that in their background had been playing in various quartet formations together, but we never all played,” explained Kayla Reiman ’14. The group, which consists of Stein, Reiman, Julius Bjornson ’14, Siri Carr ’15, Vivian Deng ’15, Harim Jung ’16, and Hea-Ream Lee ’15, practices for about two hours per week. There are currently four violinists who take turns playing first and second violin, one violist, one cellist, and a string bassist. Wesleyan University Orchestra Conductor Nadya Potemkina also occasionally plays viola with the group. Members of The F Holes noted that many student string players stopped playing with the University orchestra after freshman year but were happy to create this outlet to continue playing at a high level. Reiman added that the group’s small size allows for the members to pursue a level of musical refinement that can be hard to achieve in a larger group. “I think we’ve finally gotten to that point where the notes fit together and we can pursue that musical nuance that I’ve never done in just a completely student-led group at Wesleyan,” Reiman said. “I’ve always done that at classical music summer camps, and it tends to [require] conservatory-based training, but now we’re doing that with Wesleyan students in a completely student-run group, and it’s just starting out. We’re just getting to that level where we can pursue nuance, but it’s really exciting that we’re getting that to start happening.” Rehearsals are entirely student-run, and the group does not have a conductor. Several members of the group also said that they preferred playing in smaller groups to playing in larger orchestras due to the increased level of engagement and social cohesion that a smaller group can provide. “I spent eight years in middle school and high school playing in a quartet with the same other three people, and I really like that small environment where musicians actually have to pay attention to each other and sort of interact with each other on a personal and musical level in order to produce a good product, whereas in an orchestra it’s a lot less personal in terms of the actual product,” Bjornson said. “I don’t like just sort of reading my music and watching the conductor and hoping everything turns out. It’s not very engaging.” Stein also noted that the members of The F Holes, like members of an a cappella group, are driven to produce great music because of their own love for music and the opportunities that being in a student-run group can provide. “We view the group roughly as the strings equivalent of an a cappella group, so in that same sense we make our own rehearsal schedule,” he said. “The group functions from us being self-motivated, and because of that, we’re doing this because we want to reach that higher level, not because we’re in a class and have to do a specific rehearsal each week.” Being student-run requires a high level of motivation from the group’s members. “It definitely gives us drive in how we rehearse,” Stein said. “We’re pretty much a big chamber group that, like an a cappella group, has a lot of higher-level music communication.” The group also bears a resemblance to a cappella groups in its desire to bring accessible, crowd-pleasing music to campus. Carr noted that some students tend not to want to go to orchestra concerts, and she hopes that The F Holes can change this. “Honestly, we’re trying to kind of freshen up what classical music is, I think, and how an orchestra is perceived,” Carr said. “Nobody wants to go to a classical music concert—not nobody; I do—but you know, people are like, ‘Do you want to go see the Spirits sing?’ ‘Oh yeah, sure,’ you know? But people tend to not want to be like, ‘Let’s go to the orchestra concert.’” The group has made strides toward making orchestra music accessible by occasionally practicing in public places where students might pass by and stop to listen. “Sometimes we’ve played outside before and just stuff like that to bring classical music more into campus, because it’s something that a lot of us really care about,” Reiman said. “[I]t’s not that big a part of the Wesleyan music scene, but we’re hoping to get there.” This philosophy prompted the group to hold its first concert in the lobby of Olin Library. There, it hopes to attract an audience that might not otherwise seek out a classical music concert. The members had originally hoped to perform in the Zelnick Pavilion, where people, including a Public Safety officer, have stopped to listen to the group as it practiced; unfortunately, the space was not available. For its concert on Saturday, the group has chosen a diverse set of songs that it thinks students will enjoy: “Serenade in E Major, Op. 22” by Antonín Dvořák, a classical piece that some of the members have played before in other groups; a version of “I’ll Make a Man Out of You” from “Mulan” that Reiman’s friend from high school arranged; and “Mountain Spring,” a piece originally played by the orchestra Barrage, which was known for incorporating choreography into its performances. “We’re hoping to have a high-visibility performance, just to get the word out, because we’ve been a secret until now,” Carr said. Looking forward, the group plans to continue playing a dynamic mix of music by deceased and living composers that will appeal to a wide audience. More broadly, the members of The F Holes hope to establish the group as an outlet for high-level play for passionate, talented string instrumentalists. “What my real hope is [is] that there will continue being this community of classical musicians who draw on each other for all sorts of musical encouragement and come together and continue putting together projects with music that we really love playing,” Reiman said."
"Rob Rosenthal Discusses Life and Legacy of Pete Seeger","2014-01-29","by Gabe Rosenberg, Features Editor","Pete Seeger, the preeminent American folk singer and political activist, passed away on Monday at 94 years old. Beyond his impact and continued involvement in the folk music world, Seeger was a persistent, positive presence in social movements from the 1940s onward. John E. Andrus Professor of Sociology Rob Rosenthal became personally familiar with Seeger when writing two books, Playing for Change: Music and Musicians in the Service of Social Movements (2011) and Pete Seeger: In His Own Words (2012). The Argus spoke with Rosenthal about his experience with Seeger, the musician’s life, and his influence on the world.   The Argus: How did you come to know Pete Seeger? Rob Rosenthal: I had met him when I interviewed him for a book I had done on how music is used in social movements called Playing for Change.  And the publisher who published Playing for Change, Dean Birkenkamp, had talked to Seeger about coming out with a book that was just Seeger’s own words. He’s never written a strict autobiography, although there are autobiographical pieces in some of his books. The idea was that it was known, it was whispered, that he had incredible files on all the writings he had done over the years, in his house and barn, and this publisher asked him if there could be a book there, just his own words. He was interested, although he probably forgot about it 10 minutes after their conversation. Dean recruited me to go do it, and I recruited my son Sam to do it with me. For two years, we went to Seeger’s house maybe twice a month and would spend all day going through the unbelievable amount of files he had, looking for stuff, and spent a year figuring out which stuff we wanted to use in the book, putting it together, and running it by him.   A: How did you shape the book from what you found? RR: He’s very arguably the most important figure in folk music in the 20th century, and we knew we were interested in what he has to say. He’s written tons. He had a column, Johnny Appleseed, writing regularly. He’s written liner notes to many albums, written albums, a couple of books. He’s produced quite a bit of written material. And there were all these things that were not published, like his letters and lists that he had made and drafts of things and ideas, and we read everything. We figured out what’s interesting, what’s important historically, and we wanted to tell his life. The book is somewhat chronological; there’s a part on his early life and becoming Seeger, and parts on different movements, because he was involved in almost all of the major social movements of the 20th century in the United States. There’s a part on his thinking, because he was a very sophisticated thinker on music and the political use of music and questions of commercialization and authenticity, things that political musicians have to think about. Once we had those categories, then we figured out, within each one, what was the most important thing to show people. We wanted to show how his thinking had evolved over the years as well.   A: Can you expand more on how Seeger’s thinking changed? RR: To state the obvious, at one point he was a member of the Communist Party, and over the years he became less interested, not just in the Communist Party, but in mass parties in general. He described himself as a small-sea communist—he believed in people sharing things and didn’t think of capitalism as a good system—but he really moved into a much greater faith in small organizations and small groups. He had been involved in very large movements…but he tended to place much more faith in small groups in part because of the problems that developed with large groups. Large groups tend to get bureaucratic. I think he felt that had been a problem of the Communist Party; it was so large, it was hard for people to have a real say in what was going on after a while. And large groups tend to get out of touch with what’s going on on the ground. He was really a democrat, a [lower-case] “d” democrat, really interested in everyday people running their own lives and having more understanding of their lives. He shifted to a belief in small groups because they were closer to the ground level. He was very involved in, for instance, the Clearwater, a boat that sails up and down the Hudson River. It’s very arguable that Pete did more to clean up the Hudson than anyone. I don’t even think it’s arguable; he did. When he first noticed the condition of the Hudson, it was just atrocious, and he and a couple of people got together and created this organization Clearwater, and what they did was they built this giant ship and sailed up and down the river and had festivals at different ports and educated people about what happened to the Hudson and what could be done in the Hudson. And that was tremendously successful. Those were the sorts of things he became more and more interested in. A: How did he apply his music to the movements he was involved in over his life? RR: I think it would be a mistake to think he was only important musically in the Civil Rights movement.  He was important in the labor movement, the anti-war, anti-Vietnam movement, in the environmental movement. He used his music in three major ways: he did it in songs he wrote and performed; he did it most prominently through appearing in benefits for different groups, raising money and raising awareness; and he did it by serving as a model for other musicians. He told them, “The most important thing you can do is not become a star but work with others in movements and groups to make the world better.” In that way, he mightily influenced the generation right after him: Bob Dylan and Joan Baez and Phil Ochs. And that’s echoed down in the generations after that. There are people who don’t even know the name Pete Seeger who think of themselves as activists, progressive musicians who are following the model of the activist musician that he was developing. That was a crucial legacy of his.   A: How do you think Seeger influenced the culture and community at Wesleyan? RR: I don’t know if it’s that direct. Certainly, there are a lot of people who grew up listening to Seeger’s music. It’s sort of interesting; some people don’t even know that it was Pete’s music. He’s written some songs or popularized them, but people don’t know there’s an author to them. They think it’s old folk, like “Where Have All the Flowers Gone?” or “If I Had a Hammer.” I think Wesleyan’s notions of engagement and civil responsibility and engaged arts. We have a lot of bands that have that ethos about them. Someone like Dar Williams ’89, who was a friend of Seeger’s, she carries on that tradition of engaged musicianship.   A: What about Seeger’s legacy do you hope people should most remember? RR: I think his life is pretty well known, especially in the last couple of days. We spent a lot of time in his home looking through all these files, and the most striking thing was there were thousands and thousands of letters from people all over the world saying all sorts of things, but one message was the dominant message: “I’m off, wherever I am, I’m struggling in this political movement, I’m in jail, I’m fleeing my country, and your music is keeping me going.” And that’s an incredible legacy to have. “One of the reasons I can keep up my strength and do what I do is because of your music.” That’s as good of a legacy as I can imagine."
"Student Forums Combine Theory and Practice for Immersive Learning","2014-01-30","by Sonya Levine, Jenny Davis, Gabe Rosenberg, Staff Writer, Assistant Opinion Editor, and Feature Editor","Students searching for intriguing topics and new perspectives should look no further than this semester’s student forums. For these forums, student leaders teach and lead discussions with their peers about topics they’re passionate about. Among the 11 offerings this spring, you’re sure to find something that captures your imagination. Grant Morrison: Comic Book Writer/Rock Star/Wizard Student Leader: Matthew Amylon ’14 Faculty Sponsor: Professor of English Sean McCann When Matthew Amylon ’14 heard about “The Graphic Novel,” an advanced course offered by the English Department (in which he is a major), he was aggravated by its narrow view of the medium. “They came at it with such an outsider perspective,” Amylon said. “Comics are an entire medium. Calling that class ‘The Graphic Novel’ is like naming a class ‘The Book’ or ‘The Movie.’” Inspired partially by frustration and partially by his passion for the comic author Grant Morrison, Amylon decided to create his own forum that abides by his own standards and is structured like an English class. “It’ll be discussion-based, with a lot of reading and talking,” Amylon said. “My favorite classes in the English major are ones that focus on one or two authors and are very basic and specific.” Amylon, who has admired Grant Morrison’s work for years, is devoting the course to six of his works spanning from 1988 to the present. “We’ll be reading the first half of this series called ‘The Invisibles,’ which is what he was writing when he was taking a lot of drugs,” Amylon said. “It’s a really complicated and dense cosmological spy story, but it turns out to be much more about Eastern mysticism, the nature of the universe, and theoretical physics.” Radio Storytelling: Crafting a Narrative Through Sound Student Leaders: Rebecca Seidel ’15 and Aviva Hirsch ’16 Faculty Sponsor: Associate Professor of American Studies and Anthropology J. Kehaulani Kauanui   Seidel and Hirsch were members of WESU when they became involved with the formation of the Documentary Trolls, a radio storytelling collective affiliated with the University radio station. Soon, Seidel and Hirsch were both hooked on audio journalism. This semester, they will explore radio storytelling in a forum designed to look closely at sound and stories. Hirsch explained that contemporary radio has become increasingly popular in the past couple of decades with such transformative figures as This American Life’s Ira Glass. Radio Storytelling will study both the growth of radio and its unique effects on audiences. “We have some really great readings from accomplished producers, and in class we’ll be listening to a lot of people that [Seidel and I] listen to,” Hirsch said, who spent this past semester working on a series of radio stories in Fairbanks, Alaska. Seidel added that Radio Storytelling will serve as an introduction to all aspects of audio journalism. “We’re going to work on interviewing skills, production skills, ways to incorporate music into radio stories, and ways to get stories across,” she said. Seidel and Hirsch said they are also eager to use their forum as a means for community involvement. “We’ll be working with WESU, but we’ll also potentially collaborate with the College of the Environment, which is working on a podcast series that incorporates science into elementary education,” Hirsch said. Moreover, Seidel explained that she and Hirsch hope to engage the larger University community in addition to the students enrolled in their class. “We’re trying to get radio producers from the real world to come speak to our class and anybody else who’s interested,” she said.   Alan Watts Student Leader: Bryan Garrett-Farb [Trinity College ’15] Faculty Sponsor: Professor of Philosophy and East Asian Studies Stephen Angle   “The central piece of the philosopher Alan Watts is a basic confusion between who we think we are and who we actually are,” Garrett-Farb said. “A lot of his philosophy — really his presentation of Daoism, Hinduism, and Zen Buddhism — hinges on the notion of the self.” To that end, Garrett-Farb is leading a forum largely about the self; the class aims to explore the work of Alan Watts, a mid-century philosopher responsible for bringing Eastern philosophy to the West. “His work is fascinating and has an enormous array of consequences for personal daily life and the entire way we think about the world,” Garrett-Farb said. Along with reading Watts’ work, the class will be expected to practice meditation three times per week. The class will also practice together. “We’ll explore a few different iterations of meditation, like chanting ‘ohm,’ or listening to a gong,” Garrett-Farb said. “Watts also recorded a few guided meditations, and we’re looking into bringing in other spiritual teachers.” The class will consist of three major assignments: a journal that students will later turn into a reflection paper; an analytical paper applying Watts’ philosophy to a modern phenomenon; and a presentation of work not read in class. “I hope it’ll become a personal class as well as an academic engagement,” Garrett-Farb said. “Talking about the self changes everything. Watts challenges all our assumptions. I don’t want it to be abstract. I want it to be something lived.”   Memoirs of Crisis: Writing Through Trauma Student Leaders: Cade Leebron ’14 and Jenessa Duncombe ’14 Faculty Sponsor: Visiting Writer Clifford Chase   This semester, Leebron and Duncombe will revisit the forum that they taught in Fall 2012. Memoirs of Crisis is a writing class offered to students regardless of their writing or life experiences. “We use a working definition of trauma as something that shakes foundation,” Leebron said. “Most people have had that.” Leebron and Duncombe plan to alter the original syllabus slightly, adding readings not taught in 2012. “We have many readings that aren’t very long; it’s 20 to 40 pages of reading per week,” Leebron said. “They’re very diverse in subject matter, tone, and style. [Duncombe and I] are very familiar with the readings, so we have a lot to say about them, but the students discuss them as much as we do.” The class is structured as a workshop, so all students read and comment on each other’s writing. Because stories of trauma are intensely personal, Duncombe said she and Leebron take extra consideration for students’ comfort. Leebron added that the nature of the assigned readings, as well as the fact that she and Duncombe share their own work, contributes to a spirit of sharing. “Students feel more comfortable sharing because all the readings contain such personal material,” Leebron said. “[Duncombe and I] also write. They get to critique us; we’re not experts.”   Food Justice, Sustainability, and Sovereignty at Wesleyan and Beyond Student Leaders: Noelle Hiam ’15 and Rachel Lindy ’15 Faculty Sponsor: Director of the College of the Environment and Chair of the Environmental Studies Program Barry Chernoff   Building upon Food Justice & Sustainability at Wesleyan and Beyond, taught last semester by Jennifer Roach ’14, Rachel Weisberg ’15, and Kathryn Hardt ’15, new leaders Hiam and Lindy plan to examine international factors as well as domestic ones as they relate to food justice, sustainability, and sovereignty. “We’re trying to look at what’s currently wrong with our food system and how it impacts environmental, social justice, and animal rights issues,” Lindy said. The pair plans to draw upon their recent study abroad experiences in Vietnam, Morocco, and Bolivia. Hiam and Lindy were part of a program last semester that focused on food and energy in these locations, and they hope to lend a more international focus to the forum. The food sovereignty component is also new to the course. “Food sovereignty is the right of people to choose how the food that they consume is produced, and it aims to connect producers and consumers in a more ecologically sustainable way,” Lindy said. The forum will have both discussion and hands-on components, which might take the form of a guest lecture, foraging around campus for food, watching a TED talk, or working with on-campus groups such as Long Lane Farm or Middletown Urban Gardens. Hiam explained that students will be expected to get involved with a project related to food issues on campus or in Middletown. “A critique from last semester’s leaders was that the students had a lot of knowledge, but didn’t change anything on campus; the class didn’t practice what it preached,” Hiam said. “We’re going to encourage people to do something that will have a lasting impact.”   Cantonese Student Leaders: Vanessa Chen ’16 and Alecia Ng ’14 Faculty Sponsor: Adjunct Associate Professor of Asian Languages and Literatures and East Asian Studies Xiaomiao Zhu   Chen and Ng  taught Cantonese for Beginners last semester, and the course offered this semester is largely the same in terms of material covered. Chen and Ng will, however, use feedback from last semester to adjust their teaching style. “The class will basically be more interactive and student-oriented,” Chen wrote in an email to the Argus. “It’s going to be similar to last semester but not exactly the same, since [Alecia and I] know what worked and what didn’t work from last semester.”   Unlearning Prejudice and Practicing Self-Love Student Leaders: Alma Sanchez-Eppler ’14 and Mimi Goldstein ’17 Faculty Sponsor: Chair of American Studies Department and Olin Professor of English Joel Pfister   Discussions surrounding social justice are common at Wesleyan, but Unlearning Prejudice and Practicing Self-Love intends to facilitate discussions around themes like white privilege in a classroom setting. In turn, students will feel comfortable openly discussing such issues in more casual environments. Sanchez-Eppler said that the mission of the course is simply to discuss and ponder social justice issues that are not easily solved, considering issues through film and other cultural content. “We’re trying to pull from all over the spectrum of different writers and theorists around this work, so that hopefully people with different sensibilities coming from very different places can grab onto it and feel like they connect with it,” Sanchez-Eppler said. Throughout the course, students will practice reflective writing on the personal nature of these issues and also participate in workshops where they can share and learn from others’ writing. “The hope really is that people will be moved to be agents of change in their daily lives. I think it’s something that a lot of people want, but are unsure of how to go about it,” Sanchez-Eppler said. Goldstein feels that these conversations are vital for understanding and for attempting to make a difference. The pair hopes that the course will culminate with the students attending the White Privilege Conference in Madison, Wis., in mid-March, where students can attend workshops that will teach them skills to discuss themes of harassment and repression and find solutions to combat them in daily situations.   Modern Feminism. Period. Student Leaders: Lily Myers ’15 and Kate Weiner ’15 Faculty Sponsor: Chair of Sociology and Professor of Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Mary Ann Clawson   After spending last semester abroad in Chile and Argentina, respectively, Myers and Weiner experienced firsthand some of the institutionalized sexism that occurs in countries around the world. The pair hopes to create a space in which students can talk about feminist issues that are both universal and local, particularly those present on campus. “Feminism is something for everyone, and women’s issues are everyone’s issues,” Weiner said. “The course will remind students that feminism is not solely women’s domain.” The pair plans to incorporate art, music, poetry, and spoken word poetry into their forum. One of their favorite books, “How to Be a Woman” by Caitlin Moran, will be prominently featured in the course, as well as poetry by slam poet Caroline Rothstein, a leading anti-body shaming activist. Some topics covered will include body hair, body shaming, and race and representation within feminism, radical homemaking, portrayals of women in the media, and the correlation between environmental awareness and feminism. The mission for the course is mainly to open a dialogue about feminist issues, and to provide a space in which people can become comfortable discussing such matters. “It would be really fun to have the forum culminate in this collective action that gets everyone on campus involved,” Weiner said.   WesDEF Training: Breaking Barriers through Facilitation Student Leaders: Jessica Katzen ’16 and Alexandra Ricks ’16 Faculty Sponsor: Associate Professor of Sociology Jonathan Cutler   This course is taught every spring by WesDEFs (Wesleyan Diversity Education Facilitators), who lead discussions about social justice, diversity and anti-oppression issues throughout the school year. Katzen and Ricks took the course last spring and this semester will lead the forum to train new members to be facilitators. The course begins with basic facilitation skills, such as how to structure the workshops that WesDEF leads, how to engage with students, and how to respond to discussions. Prior to spring break, the forum will occur in a usual classroom setting, but after spring break, the forum will instead expect the students to attend and become active participants at WesDEF meetings. “We want to educate [the students] on different social justice issues and different forms of oppression, because we feel that [the goal of] WesDEF itself is to create safe spaces to discuss these issues,” Katzen said. “We hope that they become more informed members of society and ready to take action.” Some issues that the course will cover include race, gender, sexuality, and ability. “We mostly found readings from various social justice websites that we like, such as Sociological Images, Upworthy, and Buzzfeed,” Ricks said. The final project of the forum is to run a campus-wide event with the help of another group and lead a discussion centered on topics like rape culture in Greek life. Art and Science of Chemical Demonstrations Student Leaders: Stuart Pasch ’14 and Caitlin Bray ’15 Faculty Sponsor: Associate Professor of Chemistry David Westmoreland   Every year during WesFest, a group of chemistry majors puts on a 45-minute demo presentation to excite prospective students about studying science at Wesleyan. “It’s always been kind of semi-chaotic,” Pasch said. Last spring, two students created the forum “Art and Science of Chemical Demonstrations” to not only explore how to teach science through demonstrations but also use that time and space to prepare for the presentations in April. As a result, last WesFest saw more numerous, organized, and smoother demos. Pasch and Bray revived the forum this semester, gearing it towards current and prospective majors who have completed at least two years of chemistry classes. Despite the flashy, performance-heavy aspect of the demonstrations, Pasch said the projects require real scientific knowledge. “This isn’t something you say, ‘Oh, I’ll just pick this up and do this,’” Pasch said. “It’s not like anything you’ve done. It’s not just teaching. It’s multitasking.” Demonstrations include producing “gun cotton,” which results from changing the chemical composition of regular cotton into something explosive; where regular cotton burns slowly, gun cotton is set off by a mere match. Pasch said that demonstrations involving thermite, liquid nitrogen, and liquid oxygen are always well received. The demonstrations hearken back to the demos that teachers use in high school classes, but which tend to disappear once students advance to college. Scientific demonstrations take theoretical knowledge one step further, putting them into practical use. “It’s not lab work,” Bray said. “That’s the art component of it.”   Building Resilient Landscape Systems: The Intersection of Deep Ecology and Landscape Design Student Leaders: Manon Lefevre ’14 and Will Wiebe ’14 Faculty Sponsor: Associate Professor of Environmental Studies and Earth and Environmental Sciences Dana Royer   Almost as long as WILD Wes (Working for Intelligent Landscape Design at Wesleyan) has existed as a group, members have taught student forums on the issues and techniques that WILD Wes practices. Lefevre  and Wiebe, both of whom have been involved with the group, are teaching Building Resilient Landscape Systems through the lens of landscape ecology, landscape architecture, permaculture, and other perspectives. “Landscape design is very interdisciplinary, so we draw a variety of students from a variety of disciplines,” Lefevre said. “It’s a combination of design, science, and theory.” Lefevre said they plan to bring in designers, biologists, ecologists, and other professors and professionals to lecture on specific topics including soil ecology, forest ecology, and even local flora of New England. The forum features an intensive hands-on design aspect, which will require working on continuing design of the WestCo courtyard and social space, as well as planting and designing the Butterfields terrace garden. “It’s rare that you have a student forum where you’re actually doing a hands-on project, which is what we’re offering: something more visible,” Lefevre said."
"Talking Trans After “Dr. V’s Magical Putter”","2014-01-30","by Josh Cohen, Opinion Editor","On Friday, Jan. 17, after two straight days of praise, Caleb Hannan began receiving death threats. His feature for Grantland, “Dr. V’s Magical Putter,” told the wild, careening story of his investigation of the “scientifically superior” Oracle GX1 putter, a reportorial assignment that quickly shifted into an effort to find out about the golf club’s enigmatic inventor, Essay Anne Vanderbilt. Between April and October 2013, Hannan established a correspondence with the woman known as Dr. V, only to be met with backlash and eventually outright threats from her as he attempted to verify her scientific bona fides. One lie after another, he unraveled her past: she had never attended MIT or the University of Pennsylvania, was never a government contractor on any stealth bomber projects, but had propped up these false credentials in order to give her fledgling putter company clout. Adding to the mystery was the fact that, prior to 2000, there was no evidence of Essay Anne Vanderbilt existing. Prior to 2000, Dr. V had gone by her birth name, Stephen Krol. Vanderbilt was a transgender woman, information that Hannan passed on to one of Vanderbilt’s investors. Hannan also learned that Essay Anne Vanderbilt had attempted to kill herself in 2008; on Oct. 13, 2013, she was found dead with a plastic bag over her head and an empty pill bottle nearby. The writer did not dwell on this detail, ending his article one paragraph later. I devoured this article on the day it came out, enthralled by the psychological thriller tone. The story was a tangle of twists and turns, done by a writer who went to such great lengths to follow them all. Hannan’s initial conceit—a writer and golf enthusiast searches for the perfect putter—gave way to something cuttingly personal, far more personal than he could have conceived of when initially reporting. In that regard, “Dr. V’s Magical Putter” was so impressive that I never considered that Hannan might have gone too far. After a weekend of weathering intense scrutiny, Grantland reached out to Christina Kahrl, a trans woman and sportswriter, to write a follow-up entitled “What Grantland Got Wrong.” She explained how insensitive and irresponsible it was to talk about Vanderbilt’s gender as part of a profile of her con, not to mention how unethical it was to out Vanderbilt at all, both to the investor while she was alive and to the reading public when she was dead. Her gender wasn’t just irrelevant; it was private. Kahrl also offered a very relevant statistic: per a study by the National Center for Transgender Equality and the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, 41 percent of transgender people in the United States have attempted to take their own lives. “Because of this screw-up, we owe it to the ruin wrought in its wake to talk about the desperate lives that most transgender Americans lead and the adaptive strategies they have to come up with while trying to deal with the massive rates of under- and unemployment from which the trans community generally suffers,” Kahrl wrote. “And we owe it to Essay Anne to understand how an attempt to escape those things became its own kind of trap, one Grantland had neither the right nor the responsibility to spring.” On the same day Grantland published Kahrl’s rebuke, the site’s editor-in-chief Bill Simmons posted a letter explaining the in-house process leading to the publication of “Dr. V’s Magical Putter” and taking personal responsibility for Grantland’s collective editorial shortcomings. In doing so, he decried the death threats against Hannan, but not the criticism, vowing to embrace the error and be better. “We just didn’t see the other side,” Simmons admitted. “We weren’t sophisticated enough. In the future, we will be sophisticated enough—at least on this particular topic. We’re never taking the Dr. V piece down from Grantland partly because we want people to learn from our experience. We weren’t educated, we failed to ask the right questions, we made mistakes, and we’re going to learn from them.” Since Grantland’s apologies, I have read “Dr. V’s Magical Putter” a few more times. The article now runs with links to both Simmons’ and Kahrl’s responses before the original text, and it is now impossible to read Hannan’s work as anything but a writer’s reckless exploitation of his trans subject for more tantalizing material. Remembering how this writing had once thrilled me, I instead have been overcome with embarrassment, remorse, shame. I’m not transphobic, but I am more ignorant than I had realized. I understand the importance of referring to someone by their preferred gender and accompanying pronouns, but I have been prone to slip-ups, even after I’ve been corrected. As an editor, I have attempted to work around “zes” and “hirs” because I thought they sounded more awkward than “he or she” would. I agree with the movement for single-use public restrooms at Wesleyan, but I have never considered getting involved. I have been so distant from the trans* community that to me it has been little more than a handful of grammatical rules to me—and even in that sense, I should be more respectful. Only recently did I learn that though transgender is the preferred term of self-identification, the word transgendered is considered a slur. The line between right and wrong is so precarious that the past tense can deny someone agency in hir own identity. On Friday, Dec. 13, Katie J.M. Baker made Wesleyan’s trans* controversy a national issue. Her article for Newsweek, “Wesleyan Slinks Away from Its Activist Roots,” gave me cause to talk about the debate outside the campus bubble. I talked to educated, sophisticated people who asked me what I meant by “trans*” and why the battle for single-use bathrooms was so important. Put in the position to explain, I became the closest thing available to an expert on the topic, simply by virtue of going to Wesleyan. It took me over a month to figure out just how unacceptable that is. Even if you’re not an activist—and I’m certainly not—engagement with trans* issues is a necessity. The vocal minority can promote change, but unless the silent majority makes an active effort to educate itself about and accustom itself to the trans* community, protest will not beget progress, no matter how much those looking on want the protesters to succeed. Being adjacent to a controversy or a community is not equivalent to truly understanding it, and the cause is too serious and the risks too real to remain content with passing acknowledgment."
"Open Letter to President Roth","2014-02-18","by Martin Benjamin,","Dear Valentine, The Substance of President Washington’s Thanksgiving Proclamation (“Whereas it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor, and Whereas both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me ‘to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed…’”) fails to appear in yours.  But, hey, it isn’t every Hobbit on High who can honestly claim to be substance-free.  You deem the Founders’ Touchstone untouchable, easily less pronounceable than supercalifragilisticexpialidocious. Alas, your reluctance to declare the Substance of Thanksgiving calls to mind the pot calling the kettle black.  You cluck: “The newspapers have squeezed out even more substance to make room for advertising…”  And what, pray tell, was YOUR blog doing?  “…the Wesleyan Fund is conducting a one-day campaign to support our alma mater through contributions.  Your gift through the Fund, no matter how small, helps the university with its current needs, including financial aid.” You oblige the students to gift the Fund, as “…we (should) turn our attention away from buying stuff we may not need…”  “We”?   Where’s YOUR kick-off gift?  You say my request is unusual?  It is, but no more unusual than yours.  Before your formative era (the Sixties and Seventies) hit the fan, Old Wes obliged the students to work to the max in a wholly monastic enclave set in a rundown, backwater town that barely forbore the gown.  We house-boys on High (a dozen lettered Greeks) competed scholastically, high-grade competition paying off in high-grade earnings AFTER graduation, when Old Grads would plow back bumper-year earnings into improving Alma Mater’s unlittered – repeat: unlittered – estate.  Your putting the harvest season ahead of the growing season is something new in the art of cultivation. Regarding what you call “the stuff we may not need” – the hot and cold confections, the soundtracks, whatever, – one soundtrack this verbally guarded schoolyard’s children do NOT need is a Chief Diversity Officer, a schoolyard scold employed by the schoolyard bully.  You urge the students to cheer the new scold’s arrival.  I, for one, shall forgive them if they don’t, for they had no say in the purchase they’ll be paying for.  It wouldn’t cost you a penny to call it “social justice,” and if you get caught with your hand in their pocket, like Barry the Fleecer and Document-shredder, you probably will. You wish to move on?  Dear Valentine, your wish is my command. Ere you’d beaten the substantive stuffing out of the holy day of Thanksgiving, last September the very threshold of Olin was the recipient of a basting, courtesy of hollerfest MASH.  That unlicensed assault-weapon’s evident mission: to drive every thought of grave skullduggery out of circulation one whole week after classes began.  Argus arts editor Gwendolyn Rosen conveys the scene: “I began my Mash experience in SciLi, begrudgingly trying to do some of my homework before all of the fun started.  My concentration broke once I saw from the Fishbowl that President Michael Roth was rocking out with Smokin’ Lillies in front of Olin.  If the president is enjoying the sunshine, there is no better sign that you should abandon your reading to join the music.”  No better sign, that sign you stuck on the lawn in front of Olin. And you would make your MASH a yearly affair.  Must make a note of that: an annual mosh top-billing Mike the Rock, the lyricist whose compositions are stuck in the key of I (“I recently reviewed…”  “I read…”  “I met…” “I viewed…”  “I spoke…”  “And then I wrote…”).  The student body’s mental circuits need another circuit-breaker as badly as you need another I-key. And speaking of beating and basting, you have not yet begun to fight.  Soon you’ll be deleting from its lovely setting Art History’s bibliotheque.  It had too much piquant charm to survive your envy-driven pique.  Your wrecking ball would have trashed Shanklin, had the Market’s crash not erased the funds to replace it with a fitting companion to Exley, the campus’s ugliest structure till Patricelli Pavilion hove into view and staved off a later bid for that honor by Bennet Hall. The students call the Pavilion “the gas station” – an inspired call.  I call it President Douglas J. “Bigfoot” Bennet’s trademark tread-mark stomped on the chiseled face of Brownstone Row.  Doug’s idolatrous Board of Philistines (“What do WE know?”), in panic mode – a prankster had hidden their rubber stamp – until they found it, gave their ritual blessing to record fundraiser Bennet’s project, into the bargain sacrificing (yea, burning up) Art History’s faculty (“What do THEY know?”), aghast at Bigfoot’s foot on the gas. And now it’s deconstructionist Roth’s turn.  Will he complete Old Wes’s effacement within his tenure’s remaining six years?  (“And in the seventh year Roth rested.”)  Michael, first make certain Thanksgiving had been completely effaced.  Yes, you’d managed to park that holy day’s Inspiration in the trash (and that’s no ordinary, fixable parking ticket), but more could be done. Begin with a killer sound bite.  The Mayflower could be rechristened La fleur du mal (don’t mention it), but even you would rue the day – the day your fellow apaches pour over the left bank onto La rue de la paix in war paint.  You’d greet them, ejaculating “Frere Jacques, La fleur du mal est formiDABle!”  They’d heave a despairing sigh: “Another transatlantic expatriot, carried away by the clime, succumbs to Seine-stroke.” Michael, you need to get out of the Seine and give nativism a chance.  Do me the favor of showing that blooming import the compost heap, and I’ll reciprocate: I’ll feed your scrawny Thanksgiving turkey’s lede a supercalifragilisticexpialidocious sound bite.  Hark! the summary wintry remark of a wretchedly tribal apache, the first to have sighted the Pilgrims disembarking: “Palefaces.  There goes the neighborhood.” Benjamin is a member of the class of 1957."
"University Establishes “Raise the Cap Fund” For Financial Aid Donations","2014-02-27","by Tess Morgan, News Editor","At the senior class reception on Thursday, Feb. 27, University Relations announced the creation of the “Raise the Cap Fund” for financial aid donations. The fund will allow donors to contribute directly to raising the cap on the amount of funding that the University allocates to financial aid each year. After the University has reached its goal in donations for the Annual Fund, donors will be able to begin contributing to the fund. Vice President of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) Andrew Trexler ’14 explained the restrictions that existed prior to the fund’s creation. “[Before the fund], if you were to donate to financial aid [or] the endowment for financial aid it wouldn’t actually do anything to increase the amount of financial aid given out next year or any year, because we have a capped financial aid budget and a capped discount rate,” Trexler said. Trexler worked with other students to bring the issue to the attention of the administration and negotiate the creation of the fund. “The administration’s argument was that we don’t have the money we need to give out what we’ve already committed, and therefore donations to financial aid need to be budget-relieving rather than budget-incremental,” Trexler said. “But it was my feeling and the feeling of many others that restricting that wasn’t entirely fair; you need to be able to do both things simultaneously.” The creation of the fund was motivated in part by the actions of Joshua Krugman, Danny Blinderman, and Benny Docter, all seniors, in early December 2013. The three authored a petition to the University administration calling for improved donor ability to allocate funds directly to increasing financial aid. “[The petition] brought together student signatories from all corners of student ‘civil society’ (student government, SWAG and Red and Black [Callers], student activist organizations, Greek life, and others) in a unified voice,” Krugman wrote in an email to The Argus. “This unity and sense of mutual empowerment among students behind this proposal was very impressive to see.” Docter described his and his co-authors’ motivation behind the letter to the administration. “For a lot of people, the structure as it stands is not satisfactory,” Docter said. “If you look at the statistics for the [types of people] Wesleyan serves most directly, that is overwhelmingly people with privilege. So saying that you’re supporting Wesleyan as it exists right now is a politically problematic way of going about things and it is ultimately not what the people who authored the letter are comfortable with.” In the future, the University will require that the needs for the Annual Fund are met before it allows donors to contribute specifically to raising the financial aid cap. “[The creators of the fund are] basically saying, ‘We need to get our full, basic amount that we need to fundraise, and after that, we can start thinking about moving in a socially just fashion,’” Docter said. “[The fund will be open to donations] only at the point in the fiscal year when the amount for the basic annual fund has been met.” Vice President for University Relations Barbara-Jan Wilson noted that the administration was highly motivated by students, including Trexler, Krugman, Blinderman, and Docter. “Andrew Trexler met with me and President Roth to discuss ways to increase the dollars we were putting to financial aid and motivate seniors and others to give generously to financial aid,” Wilson wrote in an email to The Argus. “Chuck [Fedolfi], our Director of Annual Giving, then met with the WSA to discuss the fund and to brainstorm a name. The students themselves suggested the Raise the Cap Fund—which says it all!” Blinderman lauded the administration’s receptiveness to the petition and to students’ call for a change in policy. “The fact that student activism resulted in a positive policy outcome is proof that student engagement with the University yields real results, and is worthwhile to pursue,” Blinderman wrote in an email to The Argus. “The seriousness with which the University engaged with student concerns is empowering, and can serve as a reminder that when students mobilize, they can effect positive change on this campus, and can serve as equal partners with the administration in constructing a more just community.” Wilson described the strides the University has made in increasing donations since the creation of the “This is Why” campaign. “The [This is Why] Campaign is at $331 million toward our goal of $400 million,” Wilson wrote. “$168 of the $331 million is pledged to current and endowed financial aid.” Wilson described her hopes for the fund and for the University’s continued efforts to increase donations. “I think this will motivate people to make gifts to Wesleyan—and that is always a good thing,” Wilson wrote. “Our campaign is about Financial Aid, so this fund helps to put it front and center[…]. We will always work with donors to be creative around funding University priorities, especially financial aid.” University President Michael Roth echoed Wilson’s view of the fund. “I’m delighted with the initiative and support anything that will allow us to raise more money for financial aid,” Roth wrote in an email to The Argus. Blinderman depicted the creation of the fund as a positive step toward the unification of University and student goals. “It is my hope that the University will continue to see students as serious partners in crafting University policy, and [that it] understands this case as an example of the positive outcome that can result when students are empowered and have real input into the creation of University policy,” Blinderman said."
"Startup Showcase To Feature Alumni Work","2014-04-30","by Jenny Davis, Assistant Opinion Editor","On Sunday, May 4, the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship will welcome four alumni and one group of current students to present at the Spring Alumni Startup Showcase. The event will be held in the Olson Commons in the Career Center. “Our hope is that events like this will give students an inside look at startup culture and illuminate some pros and cons of working in a small, entrepreneurial setting,” Director of the Patricelli Center Makaela Kingsley ’98 wrote in an email to The Argus. “We also aim to connect students directly with alumni and cultivate a community of innovative Wesleyan people across generations.” Sunday’s participants are Art Feltman ’80, Founder of International Hartford; Ysette Guevara ’98, Founder and CEO of Minds on Fire; Liza Conrad ’11, Fundraising and Operations Manager of Girls Who Code; Zach Valenti ’12, Founder and CEO of Project Uplift and Beastly Productions; and Kwaku Akoi ’14, Founder of JóòMah. JóòMah, the sole group consisting of current students, was founded by Akoi last year. His team includes Sam Giagtzoglou ’16, Oladoyin Oladapo ’14, Olayinka Lawal ’15, Maxwell Dietz ’16, Geofery Yatich ’16, and Michael Yee ’14. JóòMah, a web platform that connects job seekers in Sub-Saharan Africa to employment opportunities near them, has been in development since last June. Though it is a relatively recent startup, Akoi anticipates that it will have an enormous effect in Sub-Saharan Africa and potentially in other regions. “We’re looking at a culture of employment that’s going to change,” Akoi said. “We’re hoping to tackle the problem of accessibility to jobs. If someone could sit on a bus, looking for job opportunities on their phone, receiving notifications from employers who might be looking for them, it’s democratizing the process. We are leveling the playing field for all job seekers so that it will no more be the ones from big-name schools or with powerful relatives who will have access to the best job opportunities out there.” Moreover, Akoi pointed out, connecting job seekers to employers and vice versa will have a widespread impact on the economy. “Giving someone a better job opportunity gives them more income mobility,” he said. “Giving them access to better income would transfer into better revenues for the African governments in terms of taxes. People could save more, too, and afford better education and better healthcare. I want to see JóòMah become a new and more effective way of combating poverty, which is endemic in many African countries.” Valenti, Founder and CEO of Project Uplift and Beastly Productions, is also hoping to bring about a culture shift, this one focused around mental health. “I think about [Project Uplift] as a mental health awareness campaign, and primarily what we do is bring a massive biofeedback-powered tower that we built,” Valenti said. “We guide people in a mindfulness exercise that cultivates the breath. Within a few minutes, users trigger the fan at the base to turn on, and that lifts up the planet earth beach ball. By uplifting yourself, you physically lift up the world.” Though Project Uplift is just one of Valenti’s enterprises, he has big dreams for the still-growing event service. “From the beginning, my vision was to do a national tour in a rock ‘n’ roll tour bus with a swath of professionals in different fields, from behavior therapy to yoga,” Valenti said. “The intention is to lessen the stigma and raise awareness about existing resources on college campuses. I kept hearing how much they’re spending and the amazing array of resources that are available, but the engagement isn’t correlating.” Akoi stressed that the journey to entrepreneurship is a personal one: he realized the need for a company like JóòMah when he went back to his native Ghana after his sophomore year and witnessed firsthand the difficulty that talented job seekers faced in finding employment. Instead of dispensing advice, he sees encouraging younger entrepreneurs as his most important duty to those beginning to consider a startup. “More than great advice or insight, the big thing is for them to be encouraged, inspired,” he said. “It’s not easy. It requires a lot of perseverance, focus, and drive to keep going in spite of setbacks. Feeling discouraged kills a person’s drive and passion very quickly.” Valenti agreed that supporting young entrepreneurs at this weekend’s showcase is crucial. “I am really looking forward to giving hope that it’s totally possible,” he said. “Connecting with students who have big dreams and giving them access to how to execute things while staying as sane as possible is important. Burnout in the startup world is really high, because people throw themselves full force into ventures with no guarantee of success.” Civic Engagement Fellow Jelisa Adair ’13 explained that the Patricelli Center tries to strike a delicate balance between bringing alumni back to campus and launching students’ projects out into the world. “It has to be both, and so far it has been both,” she said. “One thing you’ll realize once you leave Wes is that you’re inducted into a realm of alumni. Not many people get a job from just applying. It’s who you know. Getting alumni back not only allows them to connect with students who are here, but also gives them something to latch onto, new experiences to connect to.” Adair also sees potential for the showcase’s presenters to act as mentors for students. “If you go to your friends, they’ll tell you the same things over and over,” she said. “You need people who can think critically and help the project grow. [The presenters] come back because they know there’ll be student interaction. Mentorship is easier to give than financial support or a job. I definitely saw that happen at our last showcase, and I hope to see it happen again.” Kingsley pointed out that student entrepreneurs stand to gain a lot by connecting with their older, more experienced, counterparts. “Student entrepreneurs face the same challenges as all entrepreneurs: proving that their idea fills an existing need in an innovative way, finding key allies and collaborators, compiling resources, and remaining nimble while staying true to the mission—to name just a few,” she wrote. “Students have the added challenge of juggling their entrepreneurial work with their academic pursuits—which is no easy feat. This event is just one of many ways that students with an interest in or curiosity about entrepreneurship can find support to weather these challenges.”"
"University Creates Equity Compliance Director Position","2014-05-01","by Matt Shelley-Reade, Staff Writer","The University is introducing a new full-time position in the Office of Equity and Inclusion, the Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator. The new employee will be responsible for ensuring that the University’s policies and practices comply with Title IX, Title VII, and other Equal Opportunity laws at both the federal and state levels. The search has currently been narrowed to three candidates: Catherine Rombeau, Lance Houston and Deborah Colucci. Title IX of the Educational Amendments Acts of 1972 prohibits educational institutions from discriminating on the basis of sex, while Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating on the basis of race, religion, sex, or ethnicity. “The Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator will coordinate, conduct informal and formal investigations, provide and monitor training programs with respect to equal opportunity and discrimination issues,” the Careers at Wesleyan website reads. This past week, the University hosted separated forums for each candidate. Rombeau spoke on Friday, April 25; Houston spoke Wednesday, April 30; and Colucci spoke yesterday, May 1. Each forum had the same structure, beginning with an introduction of the candidate, followed by a Title VII and Title IX training session, and finally concluded with a Q&A section. Community participation was encouraged in both the candidate search process and open forums. Vice President for Equity and Inclusion and Title IX Officer Antonio Farias headed the search committee, which was comprised of Assistant Vice President and Dean of Students Rick Culliton, WSA Student Affairs Committee Chair Kate Cullen ’16, Director of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) Jennifer D’Andrea, and Interim Captain of Public Safety Paul Verrillo. Farias commented on the process of choosing a candidate and on the format of the open forum. “This is the Wesleyan process,” Farias said. “…For the the director level, you go through the full day process, and you have a community discussion…. I think for the community, particularly with this issue right now—Title VII and Title IX—it’s a hyper salient conversation, so it makes sense to have an open forum discussion. There’s also a certain level of skill the search committee wants to see in person—the performative aspect of the job.” Cullen spoke to the importance of community engagement in regard to the Equity Compliance Director & Deputy Title IX Coordinator, a position that will undoubtedly deal with sexual assault on campus. “I expect a good student turnout as sexual assault and Title IX is a hot issue on campus,” Cullen wrote in an email to The Argus. “I also hope we can engage in a meaningful dialogue with the candidates since this truly is an important job that will hopefully have a big impact on campus.” D’Andrea commented on the search process, explaining the qualifications they were looking for in each candidate. “The university conducted a national search to identify qualified candidates for this position,” D’Andrea wrote in an email to The Argus. “All three candidates possess a wealth of knowledge in the area of Title IX and Title VII, and are motivated to work with students in a higher education setting.” In their presentations, the candidates were tasked with offering training on Title VII and Title IX. In addition, candidates scrutinized potential areas of confusion between the two anti-discrimination laws, often offering fictional discrimination situations. Farias spoke on the importance of distinguishing between the two different laws. “Lots of people are experts in Title VII [and] you have less folks…[who] are experts in Title IX,” Farias said. “I need somebody who can cross both streams…. We’re…looking for a dynamic person that understands and has a full grasp of those laws and is able to function in the Wesleyan ecosphere—understanding that they’re not only going to be dealing with faculty; they’re going to be dealing with Wesleyan students, they’re going to be dealing with staff, and they’re going to be dealing with all three of those simultaneously at any given point.” D’Andrea furthered Farias’ point, exploring the capacity for each candidate to work with students. “[A]s director of CAPS, I am deeply invested in the selection of the person who will be interacting with students who come forward with Title IX and Title [VII] issues,” D’Andrea wrote in an email to The Argus. “[I]t is important to me that we select a candidate who is an expert in this area, and who possesses the sensitivity and interpersonal skills to effectively interact with students in the course of doing this very difficult work.” Civic Engagement Fellow Jelisa Adair ’13, who attended Houston’s open forum, commented on her unique perspective on the selection process. “Coming from being…a student and now becoming a staff member, I’m able to so much more clearly see the way we treat staff versus the way that we treat students,” Adair said. “I’ve had training like this before, but I never had training like this as a student…. It’s important that whoever we get in this position is able to relay this information to the student body, because I don’t think it has been done before in a good way.”"
"WSA Adopts Resolution Supporting Divestment From Israeli Military Occupation of Palestine","2014-05-05","by Courtney Laermer, Assistant News Editor","At Sunday’s meeting, the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) voted to adopt Resolution 11.35, which calls for the University and the WSA to divest from companies that profit from the occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, and East Jerusalem. Members of the WSA had discussed this resolution during the three weekly meetings that preceded the vote. According to WSA President Nicole Updegrove ’14, the WSA is peripherally invested in the region through about $80,000 that is currently a part of the Wesleyan Endowment. “We will likely move to a more transparent section of the Wesleyan Endowment where we can be sure that student money is invested somewhere that all students can support,” Updegrove wrote in an email to The Argus. Earlier this year, members of the University circulated a petition calling for divestment, and over one quarter of the student body signed the petition. A press release circulated by students in support of the WSA decision explained that the petition also recognized the divestment resolutions passed by the student governments of UC Irvine, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, Oberlin College, University of Massachusetts-Boston, Arizona State University, Hampshire College, University of Michigan-Dearborn, Wayne State University, and others. The work of the international Boycott, Divest, and Sanction (BDS) movement encouraged the adoption of this resolution. Consequently, some students believe that this conclusion is a concrete step toward ending the occupation and restoring the internationally recognized rights of Palestinian people. “[The resolution demands divestment from] companies that a) provide weaponry, security systems, prisons, or other military support for the illegal occupation of the Palestinian territories; or b) facilitate the building or maintenance of the illegal Separation Wall or the demolition of Palestinian homes; or c) facilitate the building, maintenance, or economic development of illegal Israeli settlements, outposts, and segregated roads and transportation systems on the occupied Palestinian territory (Gaza Strip, West Bank, and annexed East Jerusalem); for the purpose of removing the financial incentive to participate in the illegal occupation and exploitation of indigenous Palestinians and their land,” the resolution reads. Rebecca Markell ’14 believes that the resolution inherently associates the University with the BDS movement, an organization that she says calls for the destruction of the state of Israel and denies the right for Jewish self-determination. “It divests from both Israeli and Palestinian security, and undermines negotiations towards a peaceful two-state solution,” Markell wrote in an email to The Argus. Opponents of the resolution introduced two last-minute amendments, both of which were rejected by the WSA following continuous debate. “One of the rejected amendments condemned the BDS movement, while the second called for divestment from indirect support of groups recognized by the US government as terrorist organizations,” the press release read. “…Regarding the latter, assembly members recognized its practical impossibility, as well as the fact that support of these organizations is already illegal under US law. Co-signers of the resolution voiced that both of these amendments would contradict the original resolution.” Markell commented on the refusal to add the amendments. “Even though supporters of the resolution denied involvement with the BDS movement, they refused to add amendments condemning it,” Markell wrote. “They also failed to pass an amendment condemning terrorism and divesting from anyone indirectly funding terrorist organizations.” Rebecca Casper-Johnson ’15, a member of J Street U, explained that J Street U opposes the BDS movement and Resolution 11.35. “I do not believe that divestment is an effective tactic in ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the human rights violations encompassed by the Israeli occupation, and am disappointed that the WSA passed up a chance to include an amendment supporting Israel’s right to exist within a two-state solution, which I believe is the only viable political solution to the conflict,” Casper-Johnson wrote in an email to The Argus. “I would call upon the community to find avenues for constructive engagement with both sides as a means to furthering the cause of human rights in the region.” However, other students, such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) member JJ Mitchell ’15, were in firm support of the resolution. “The WSA’s vote to pass the resolution gives me hope that the student body cares about where our money is going and refuses to be complicit in funding an illegal colonial project,” Mitchell wrote in an email to The Argus. Markell explained that she felt that the meeting’s atmosphere was hostile. “Every time I spoke, I was laughed at, shushed, and mocked (by other attendees, not WSA members),” Markell wrote. “When WSA members attempted to keep order and respect, their request was ignored and the negative attitude continued to pervade the room. After the vote passed, supporters of the resolution screamed out in victory and continued to audibly do so after leaving the room, disrupting the meeting to the point where WSA members had to reprimand them for their disrespect.” However, Christian Hosam ’15 explained that from his perspective, the idea of a resolution designed to claim that we desire not to be complicit in human rights atrocities should not be a politically divisive issue. “From being in the meeting, it felt as though a number of people were concerned about the potential co-option of the rhetoric coming out of the resolution,” Hosam wrote in an email to The Argus. “I query that because it sends a message that we are more concerned about political correctness than the occupation itself. I am heartened, however, that the resolution passed as it did and I hope that this is indicative of the way that the University can evolve from very difficult dialogues on social and global justice issues.”"
"Monument Quilt To Cover Foss","2014-09-01","by Sofi Goode, News Editor","This monument to survivors of sexual assault aims to create a space of public healing. c/o kickstarter.com This afternoon, the University will be the first college campus to host the Monument Quilt, a large quilt composed of 250 squares documenting stories of sexual violence and assault. The Quilt has toured the eastern United States throughout the month of August, making 13 stops, starting in Arden, NC, and ending in Middletown, CT. The Monument Quilt project is run by FORCE: Upsetting Rape Culture, an activist collective dedicated to starting a more honest conversation about sexual violence. Natalie Ancona ’15 explained that the Monument Quilt is an ongoing project that will eventually be placed on the National Mall in 2016. “The idea behind the Monument Quilt is that there’s never been a monument for survivors of rape and sexual violence,” Ancona said. “It’s not really a nationally or internationally recognized thing that has passed. It’s still in the process.” A collective of individuals called the Feminist Underground, headed by Ancona, Chloe Murtagh ’15, and Ryden Nelson ’16 coordinated the Monument Quilt event at the University. Other sponsors of this event include the Feminist Art and Thought Collective, Students for Consent and Communication, Clinic Escorts, the Sexual Assault Response Team, the English Department, the FGSS Department, Writer’s Bloc, and the Women and Families Center. Although the Quilt has reached many communities on the East Coast, Wesleyan’s event will be the first that is student-focused. Murtagh stated that FORCE leaders Hannah Brancato and Rebecca Nagle reached out to the group following the controversy about sexual assault in fraternities on campus in spring 2014. “They had been following the situation at Wesleyan last semester and found it very disturbing,” Murtagh said. “[They] understood how turbulent it was and thought that since they were doing this summer tour, they could end the tour at Wesleyan and help us start the year off on a really empowering, positive, forward note.” Connecticut Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy will be speakers at Tuesday’s event along with the founders of FORCE and several others. The tour stop will include multiple events spanning from Tuesday’s quilt showcase on Foss Hill to an art exhibition in the Zelnick Pavilion. The tour will end on Sunday, Sept. 6, with a quilt-making workshop led by Sexual Assault Response Coordinator Alysha Warren, as well as Isabel Alter ’17 and Tess Altman ’17. The squares that are made in this workshop will be a part of the Monument Quilt on its next summer tour in 2015. Alter spoke to the importance of making the workshop a communal space for healing. “Reinforcing the ‘you are not alone’ message is a really big part of this, and a good thing to get early in the year,” Alter said. “One of the things that I have clearly understood so much better [from The Monument Quilt] is how much the [University] staff that works immediately with this really cares….There are too many people that care for nothing to change.” Nelson stated that the events are designed to continue the conversations about sexual assault on campus that began in the spring. “[It’s about] maintaining the momentum that we developed last semester but maybe changing the timbre of the conversation so we’re not focused on cutting the population of the school in half between pro-frat and anti-frat,” Nelson said. “It’s not nearly that simple.” Murtagh agreed, adding that the Quilt provides a safe space for survivors of sexual assault. “The Monument Quilt is coming to create a space of public healing and public support, and to revamp the community engagement in this issue,” Murtagh said. “This event is hopefully going to inspire people to work for change both socially and policy-wise, but it’s really focused on the community aspect. Experiencing sexual violence should not be a private, shameful experience. We should have a community where people will publicly support you.” University President Michael Roth voiced his support for the presence of the Monument Quilt on campus. “I think that [it is] a really important thing to remind students, especially a student who might have been a survivor of an assault, that she’s not alone,” Roth said. “There are other people who have suffered from these kinds of incidents. They have survived and they have made their environment a better place by reporting them. They have helped raise awareness and when a perpetrator is found, that person will be punished accordingly.” Murtagh noted that although the Monument Quilt is focused on community impact, the Feminist Underground hopes it inspires the University to update and revise its sexual assault policy. “There are prevention efforts and adjudication efforts, and both need to be completely revamped,” Murtagh said. “We need the school to beef up its prevention and encourage this conversation and not do stupid token activities like AlcoholEdu; to have real, conscious prevention efforts including getting rid of problematic aspects of the campus culture; and second, real adjudication that is consistent and takes seriously sexual violence.” Events throughout the week are open to all members of the University and Middletown communities. Ancona hopes that the Monument Quilt will jumpstart conversation among everyone who attends. “The Monument Quilt is really cool because you can read literally all kinds of stories of sexual violence,” Ancona said. “It doesn’t just look like the typical narrative. It’s a lot of different kinds of stories all under this umbrella term of sexual violence. I think our campus needs to understand because people think that it’s not here sometimes, but it’s everywhere. You just need to open your eyes.” Altman noted that the large physical size of the Monument Quilt will draw attention to both the Quilt itself and the stories that it stands for. “[I’m excited] that it’s going to be on the football field and it’s going to occupy such a large physical space on campus,” Altman said. “It’s going to be really powerful to show freshmen that not only does rape culture occupy a space on campus, but this network of support and people caring…also occupies a big physical space on campus.” Altman added that the Quilt’s huge size speaks to an inclusive spirit overall. “If you’re interested, or you care, or you’re affected, there’s a place for you here,” she said."
"Bodies as Art: ICPP Trains Next Generation of Performance Curators","2014-09-11","by Gabe Rosenberg, Arts Editor","This innovative masters program brings together artists and communities.c/o John Groo Xaviera Simmons sits on a stage, fully dressed. She places a pair of scissors on the ground and invites the audience to come up, cut off pieces of her clothing, and take them. Simmons is performing “Cut Piece,” a conceptual art piece created by Yoko Ono, almost 50 years after its original 1964 performance. The occasion is “Performing the Precarious: Day Into Night,” a two-evening series organized by the Danspace Project in New York City. This series hit the stage last December. Before it could happen, though, someone had to clear it with Ono. That someone was Lydia Bell ’07 M ’12, who approached the famous Fluxus artist with a pitch planned: a thesis around the meaning of Simmons’ “reperformance.” Ono, of course, said yes, but with one caveat: She couldn’t use the word “reperformance.” That threw a wrench into Bell’s vision for the event, but no matter. As a performance curator, her job is to work with artists not just in the theoretical but in the practical realm, turning ideas into realities. They just take a little finagling sometimes. For that ability, she has Wesleyan’s Institute for Curatorial Practice in Performance to thank. After three years and more than 30 students (Bell included), the one-of-a-kind program is transitioning to become a fully formed Masters degree, aiming to train the next generation of dance, theater, and performing arts curators.   Presenting the Ephemeral The Institute first launched in 2011 as a 9-month certificate program, spearheaded by Center for the Arts Director Pamela Tatge and Lower Manhattan Cultural Council president Sam Miller ’75. Born as a collaboration between the CFA, arts faculty, and outside practitioners, the Institute was designed to combine intensive study and fieldwork in a previously unexplored manner. “There are many places to go in the United States to study curating in the visual arts, but there’s no place to go to study how to organize performance,” Tatge said. After graduating Wesleyan with a degree in theater, Miller spent years in the arts world organizing conferences and workshops and working with artists and presenters at places like the Jacob’s Pillow dance center and the New England Foundation for the Arts. He helped found the Center for Creative Research, which paired established choreographers with universities to create original projects. Wesleyan and the Center for the Arts, under Tatge’s direction, were enthusiastic pioneers of Miller’s program. But Miller soon began asking about the future of such collaborations: Who would lead the way in supporting contemporary performance? And how would they gain the knowledge and tools to do so? If any place could provide that education, Miller decided, it would be Wesleyan. “Wesleyan has a historic commitment to interdisciplinary work, to contemporary artists, to different traditions and aesthetics,” Miller said. “It’s the right ground for this to grow in.” Other curation programs only dedicate a course or two at most to curating dance, theater, or performance art, but Tatge said Wesleyan is in a unique position to offer a deeper discussion. “We have always studied the arts in their social, cultural, [and] historical contexts. And in terms of making good curators, they are people who have…the multiple lenses through which to see a performative event, to be able to reach back and look at the influences of that artist, to that artist’s interaction with the current contemporary world,” Tatge said. “That’s how we think at Wesleyan.” Performance curation is an odd beast: Like visual art, performance art can be situated in cultural and historical movements, and within the larger portfolio and background of an artist. Yet performance art also comes with a unique set of challenges foreign to visual art. “Performance work is ephemeral; it exists in a moment and then doesn’t exist anymore,” Tatge said. Bell suggests another way of thinking about performers: “Their bodies are the artwork.” With that definition, a large part of performance curation understandably revolves around the curator developing a long-term relationship with an artist. “There’s a whole set of responsibilities when that’s a live, living person,” Bell said. “To me, it means really putting the art and the artist first.” Curators, Tatge said, take on the role of advocate: They maintain connections to artists even after a single show wraps up. When Miller began at Jacob’s Pillow, he started working one-on-one with artist-choreographer Bill T. Jones over the course of a number of years. Phil Bither, Senior Curator of Performing Arts at Minneapolis’s Walker Arts Center and ICPP instructor, has commissioned choreographer Ralph Lemon to the Walker time and time again. And Tatge, through the CFA, not only commissioned playwright Leigh Fondakowski to write the play “SPILL” in the aftermath of the Gulf Coast oil disaster, but she also worked with presenters and theaters to bring that performance to venues across Louisiana. Curator-artist relationships are mutually beneficial, both allowing the artist to grow and providing the institution with quality art. “Maybe that work has only reached one level and could reach another level, and so maybe it’s bringing that artist back, or finding another place for that artist to take the next phase of that work,” Tatge said. Being able to understand, organize, and support an artist’s work requires a wide variety of skills, from research to management and entrepreneurship. “What are the resources that artist needs to realize their vision? Do they need a dramaturg? Do they need a technical person to come in?” Tatge said. “And then, how do I position this work for and offer it to a community, so I can maximize the engagement and participation of the community in that work?”   Considering the Community ICPP walks its students through everything they see necessary to navigate the contemporary performance art world. Students in the Institute come for an intensive two-week summer session, and for two additional weekends in the fall and spring. The classes they take include Social and Cultural Context, looking at the major art movements of the 20th and 21st centuries; Perspectives In Performance as Culture, considering the effect of personal biases and experiences on art and curation; Entrepreneurial Strategies; and Considering Site, taught by Associate Professor of Art Elijah Huge, about how architecture and design factor into performances. Tatge’s question of community involvement plays a huge part in the thinking going on at ICPP. For Jaamil Kosoko M ’12, Assistant Curator in Humanities and Engagement at New York Live Arts, performances were one way to bring together a community. “Early on, it was really just a sincere need for me to present work and to fulfill what I saw to be some serious cultural malfunctioning,” Kosoko said. Performance events provide venues to inform and challenge viewers and participants about the ideas and issues fueling the art, which Kosoko must also take into consideration for the structures—the scheduling, the marketing, even the time and place—surrounding the performance itself. “We use words like ‘feminism,’ ‘African American studies,’ ‘queer theory,’ and ‘afro-futurity,’ but these are pretty unstable signifiers,” Kosoko said. “They mean a lot of different things and have a particular connotation to various people and various communities. Something that I am really interested in is creating opportunities to situate interviews, conversations, panels, various dialogues, and opportunities for education into institutions that otherwise, because of various reasons, may not be able to put as much focus on that practice as probably they should.” Practice is the constant companion to theory in the ICPP. Much of the program focuses on walking students through the process of curation, whether for a single event or project, an artist’s catalog, or even an arts festival. That’s also where distance learning, built into both the certificate and the Masters program, comes in. All students undertake a field practicum—or two, for Masters students—where they spend time going deep into an original project, either with an artist or placed at an institution: the Danspace project, New York’s Museum of Modern Art, Minneapolis’s Walker Arts Center, and the University of California, Los Angeles [UCLA] are all partners. “They’ve done interesting projects in Stanford, Ohio State, Montreal, San Francisco, New York City, Philadelphia,” Miller said. “There’s already a body of work that we’re proud of.” And because many students come to the Institute already with a position at an arts organization, those projects can go right back to the institutions where the students work and be realized. Megan Brian M ’13, Education and Public Programs Coordinator at SFMOMA, spent her practicum on a series on the relationship of humor to performance that SFMOMA then presented. Masters students, appropriately, will have one more hurdle to clear: a thesis, which will be the major written work that many undergraduates are familiar with, and a creative output, like a festival or catalog. For professionals looking to advance in their careers, the Masters program is a much-needed credential, and the thesis is the capstone to tie together their learning. The program, it’s interesting to note, is budget-neutral. ICPP takes no money from Wesleyan and instead self-funds entirely from tuition—around $8,000 for the certificate and $28,000 for the Masters, not including room and board—and grants. One of ICPP’s aspirations, Miller said, is to construct a unified vision of best practice in the performance world, establishing performance curation as an independent academic field. Discussion and community play a role in this, as well: on July 25, the ICPP brought in curators from across the country for a public unveiling of the Masters program, live-streaming panels online and hosting viewing parties in Boston and San Francisco. Kristy Edmunds, director of UCLA’s Center for the Art of Performance, said in her keynote address that art institutions have a responsibility to invest in creativity, not simply for a profit, but as an end in itself. If curators are the gatekeepers of art, as Miller described it, it is leadership’s responsibility to help them make better, educated decisions about how artists are supported and presented to the community. “Curate, in Latin, means the protector of the soul of something,” Edmunds said. “That to me is the fundamental job description, in our case, the ephemeral and extraordinary life of what artists make and do as a singular gift into our heritage.”"
"Long Lane Sells Produce at North End Farmers Market","2014-09-22","by Erica DeMichiel, Food Editor","c/o Erica DeMichiel I’ve always found a certain kind of comfort in fall produce. The crunch of a perfectly ripened Empire apple, the warmth of a bowl of cauliflower soup, and the often-spicy scent of pumpkin all make parting ways with the warm months of summer a bit easier to accept. Fall is my favorite time of year as far as food is concerned; to me, there are few things as pleasant as visiting an outdoor market on a brisk autumn morning and perusing the fruits of the farmers’ labor. At the North End Farmers Market on Main Street, Wesleyan students from Long Lane Farm are among the farmers presenting their harvest. Every Friday from June 20 to Oct. 31, Long Lane Farm’s student volunteers set up a tent outside It’s Only Natural Market (ION) to sell their produce to members of the Middletown community. Joined by other Connecticut vendors such as Beckett Farm of Glastonbury and George Hall Farm of Simsbury, the students do business from 10 a.m. until 2 p.m. Though the market is only open for four hours, Long Lane volunteer Hailey Sowden ’15 says the day involves much more than simply bringing the produce to Main Street. “Folks typically start showing up at the farm at 7 a.m. to help with the harvest,” Sowden said. “It’s usually sort of a mad dash, but we get it done. We harvest, weigh produce, load up the table and tent and other market-related stuff and go over to ION to set up.” According to Holt Akers-Campbell ’16, another Long Lane volunteer, the biggest sellers are usually husk cherries, cherry tomatoes, and watermelons. The farm also sells a wide variety of produce, including kale, collards, squash, heirloom tomatoes, and eggplant. Like most organic farms, Long Lane must adapt to issues stemming from pests and disease. Though some crops are in poor shape by the end of the growing period, others are much easier to maintain. “Tomatoes are our biggest producer in terms of weight,” Akers-Campbell said. “We give upwards of 100 pounds a week to Bon Appétit. The kale is struggling a bit now with a lot of insect damage.” Sowden agreed, adding that many other crops prospered at the farm this year. “Tomatoes might be the star, but our lettuce was really good this year,” Sowden said. “We were able to harvest it into the summer for a lot longer than expected. We just took out the summer squash, but it also did really well. We were picking it a few times a week and getting pretty big harvests each time. I agree with Holt about the kale—greens are sometimes tricky because in order to sell them they have to look perfect, but insects and other critters love them.” Sowden and Akers-Campbell are passionate about the produce they sell each week, but their favorite part about working at the North End Farmers Market is getting a chance to interact with the customers who support their efforts. “The market is a great way for the farm to get involved with the wider Middletown community,” Sowden said. “Oftentimes we’ll meet someone at the market who will then come volunteer on the farm. We get to chat with all kinds of people and learn what sort of things they make with our produce. It’s also great to be able to provide high-quality organic produce to people of all incomes at a fair price. Beyond all of this, the market is also just really social and fun.” Long Lane also holds open-community workdays every Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., when people interested in the farm can join students in tending the crops. Aside from these weekly engagement activities, Long Lane’s next big event is its eleventh annual Pumpkin Fest, which will take place at the farm on Oct. 25. The day features live music, crafts, and (of course) food in celebration of the fall harvest."
"Davison Art Center Receives $111,173 Digitization Grant","2014-09-24","by Kathy Yun, Contributing Writer","The Davison Art Center was given a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services for digitization projects.The Davison Art Center (DAC) received a $111,173 grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) on Friday, Sept. 19 to be used for a series of digitization projects. The grant was awarded under the IMLS’ Museums for America program for the proposed use of digitizing works to add to the DAC’s collection. Over the next three summers, the collections will be exhibited in the gallery and will feature pre-1900 prints from different countries. During summer 2015, master prints from German and Dutch artists will be featured, and in the coming years, the DAC will display pre-1900 British prints and other areas of the collection. A temporary project staff team will be hired to execute the digitizing process, including a photographer, individuals with experience in image preparation, and two University students or recent graduates. The collections will be held in the summer from mid-June to late July, lasting five or six weeks, over three summers. Manager of Museum Information Services and project director for the grant Rob Lancefield ’82 stated that the DAC hopes to provide opportunities for emerging professionals and individuals early on in their career. University students will serve as assistants and will undergo training in organizing collections. By fall, all of the images from each summer are expected to be available in the DAC Collections Search online. Although the project’s primary purpose is to make available richer visual resources for University students and faculty, the sources will be open and downloadable for the public. IMLS serves as the primary source of federal support for the nation’s 123,000 libraries and 35,000 museums. The Museums for America program specifically supports learning experiences, engagement of community members, increased accessibility of rich collections, and the safeguarding of the nation’s cultural and scientific heritage. Lancefield stated that the DAC hopes the availability of these classic pieces will be useful to both students and scholars. “Let’s say that somebody’s doing a research project,” Lancefield said. “For example, an art history student here or a scholar, and they’re looking at different impressions of certain Rembrandt prints. When the grant-funded work is further along, one of the things they will be able to do for that is download a high-resolution image of a print that is in our vault, which for many purposes can be exactly what they need.” The University was one of the 196 institutions awarded a grant out of the 554 institutions that were involved in the application process. In its search, the IMLS looked for applicants with the resources to execute their projects efficiently and whose proposals aligned with the IMLS mission. Lancefield stated that he believes this project is in line with the purpose of the DAC. “The project lines up very well with why the DAC is here, and what it is that we do to serve Wesleyan’s mission,” Lancefield said. Curator at the Davison Art Center Clare Rogan expressed her excitement about making the collections available digitally. “This is a wonderful opportunity for us to do what a lot of small institutions have difficulty doing,” Rogan said. “It really enables us to make this collection more visible on the web nationally and internationally.” University President Michael Roth shared his positive outlook on the project and the impact it will have on the students. “The grant is a good step to making [the DAC collection] more visible to students and faculty,” Roth said. “We need to make the collection more accessible and we can’t do that by saying, ‘Hey, here’s a print, take it to your room,’ because they’re too fragile. But we could say, ‘Here’s a digital copy of the print.’ If you have things digitized, you can search, you can look for things, and then go in and get the materials to work with.” Lancefield stated that the DAC sees this grant as recognition of the importance of the Center’s contribution to the University community. “Thanks to the IMLS, this is going to make so many great things possible,” Lancefield said. “As fairly a small number of museums started having open access policies for images, the Davison Art Center hopes to create as many images, as long as there isn’t another copyright holder, for greater visible access for the public.”"
"Keeping the Faith: Religious Groups Fuse a Range of Beliefs","2014-09-29","by Taylor Leet-Otley, Staff Writer","The Argus takes a look at the role of religious groups on campus.Although it was founded in 1831 under the auspices of the Methodist Episcopal Church, Wesleyan ended its religious affiliation in 1907, ostensibly over Professor of Chemistry Wilbur Atwater’s experimentation on the nutritional value of alcohol in the face of Episcopal disapproval. Though the University’s religious affiliation may be history, that history is embedded in the fabric of Wesleyan’s campus. The school’s ubiquitous coat of arms consists of a shell-studded cross and was taken from John Wesley’s family crest, and until the 1930s, varsity athletic teams even went by the moniker “the Fighting Methodists,” which was only later swapped out for the more generic “Cardinals.” The Old Methodist rugby team has still not received the memo. Today, Wesleyan students build on that history with a wide array of religious affiliations and backgrounds. Though a great many Wesleyan students describe themselves as non-religious, or as religious only in a cultural sense, an open and inclusive religious life still thrives on campus, centered around program houses such as Buddhist House, Light House, Turath House, and the Bayit, where Shabbat dinners draw dozens of students every Friday night. “When I came to Wesleyan I did not immediately find my community,” said Emma Golub ’16, a former Bayit resident and a current Jewish Renaissance Fellow. “I’m so happy now to at the end of my Friday go to Shabbat, sing, reflect, think about my week, do the Rabbi’s activities, and eat a really delicious meal with my friends. There’s something nice about having that Friday night tradition. We want to be open to everyone on campus, so that anybody who is interested in that kind of community experience is absolutely welcome.” Many Jewish-affiliated events are organized through collaboration between the Bayit; Rabbi David Leipziger Teva, Director of the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life and University Jewish Chaplain; and Rabbi Levi Schectman, a member of the Jewish Chabad organization and its representative at Wesleyan. “It’s wonderful to collaborate with student musicians, activists, and poets to make events on campus that are meaningful and transformative,” Teva said. “It’s inspiring to see eighty people at a Shabbat service and dinner like we had last week.” For those looking for a more intimate experience, Rabbi Schectman offers students a smaller venue for weekly celebration. “We do have Shabbat dinner, but we do it a little bit different,” Schectman said. “We do a more intimate family-style dinner. So when we invite students for Shabbos, we don’t make an event inviting people. But we create relationships, [and] ask, ‘Would you like to join our family for Shabbat?’ So typically we have a much smaller handful of students. In a certain sense we aim to create a home-away-from-home environment.” For many Jewish students, last week was particularly abuzz with preparation for the Jewish New Year, Rosh Hashanah. “It’s different than most services that go on here,” Golub said. “It’s such an important event. It’s the New Year. It’s a bit more official. Whereas you can roll up to Shabbat in your sweatpants 20 minutes late and it’s fine, Rosh Hashanah is an important holiday in the Jewish calendar.” Though many students return to their families to celebrate the holiday, there is a flurry of programs and activities on campus, such as the annual shofar (a traditional instrument made of a ram’s horn) factory outside of Usdan, run by Schectman. “Whenever the holidays come around we do events like that shofar factory,” Schectman said. “We’ve done that every single year that we’ve been here; it’s been 4 years. We like to do as many different events as possible. It’s hard to cater to everybody on campus, when everybody has different Jewish experiences, what they expect, et cetera. But we try different things, different entry points, [so] that people [can] be comfortable with getting in touch with their Judaism or exploring it even for the first time.” For Christian students as well, the campus also offers a sense of community and welcoming. In the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life, Teva is joined by University Protestant Chaplain and Reverend Tracy Mehr-Muska, who coordinates Christian life on campus. Together with students of various faiths, the two are developing an Interfaith Council to coordinate religious life on campus. “[The Interfaith Council] will host interfaith events and programs on campus, with the goals of helping build relationships between diverse spiritual and religious communities and increasing awareness of these different groups among the student body at large,” Mehr-Muska said. “I am grateful to students who have shown great initiative in this regard and will help create this important cohort.” The Christian community at Wesleyan is active throughout the year. “We have five distinct Christian groups that work both independently and collectively to develop programs and events: the Wesleyan Christian Fellowship, Multicultural Campus Ministries, Wesleyan Association of Christian Thinkers, Lighthouse, and the Catholic Student Organization are each vibrant and active,” Mehr-Muska said. “They have regular weekly gatherings for prayer, Bible study, informal fellowship, and spiritual development, and we collectively have special gatherings, such as our barbecue at Lighthouse, community service activities, a Christmas service and dinner, an ecumenical Ash Wednesday service, Easter services, and more.” On Sundays, Mehr-Muska is also in charge of Christian services on campus. The air is familial and open at these small services in Allbritton’s conference room, high above the bustling campus below. These services are always followed by dinner. Wesleyan’s Christian communities are rather open affairs as well.  Mehr-Muska has supported the Catholic community while Wesleyan’s Catholic chaplain Father Hal Weidner is on leave. Mehr-Muska aims to extend her engagement with the student body beyond denominational boundaries. “Only about half of the students I met with privately last week, for instance, identify as Christian,” Mehr-Muska said. “There is also significant theological diversity within the Christian community itself, and it is a joy to see students who may not agree on everything theologically or politically work together and support one another.  I believe that questions related to the meaning of life, major [or] career choices, relationships, and struggles and joys are all spiritual issues, and I enjoy exploring those questions with the diverse and intellectually engaged students at Wes.” Among the students who regularly work with Mehr-Muska is Ben Zucker ’15, the coordinator of the Unitarian Universalist (UU) Campus Ministry. The group, which has been active since 2011, holds small services upstairs in the Office of Religious and Spiritual Life on Sundays. “For the most part, this is solidly a student community,” Zucker said. The group receives many students from UU backgrounds, but also from a range of other beliefs and traditions. “Part of UU is that it’s a faith that takes in a lot of people,” Zucker said. “Not that it’s a faith of refugees, but I know a lot of people who are Wiccans or ex-Catholics. We have these mainline Christian things, and we also have UU services. We’ve gotten a lot of people who have no idea what it is, so I’ve had to pitch it to them in kind of a ‘What is UU?’ elevator speech. Some of the more active UUs sought me out. So I think it’s great that people come to it in a variety of ways.” As the group is entirely student run, it often engages with the UU community at large for support and direction. “Places we get support from include some of the local UU churches,” Zucker said. “There’s one in Meriden. The director of religious vocation there has always brought us over for meetings [and] dinners. Also UU churches in Hartford and Bridgeport are places we’d be interested in visiting. People have expressed an interest in helping us get our feet off the ground, whatever that involves.” Zucker hopes to continue to hold UU events throughout the year. “We’ve done some nature meditations sometimes, so we’re thinking of what we can tie together between climate and nature,” Zucker said. “We might go and do a little thing and hang out near Wadsworth Falls next Sunday, so that’s a sample of the many things we have down the road. This is something important that I want to take time and do. It’s important to keep yourself thinking broadly.” Though Buddhist practice has a somewhat looser structure than those of the Judeo-Christian religions on campus, the Buddhist House (BuHo) on Washington street forms a hub for those interested in Buddhist practices, beliefs, or philosophical traditions. While BuHo is perhaps best known for hosting frequent and eclectic concerts throughout the year, the house provides an environment in which students can explore Buddhism. Visitors are expected to remove their shoes when entering the house, which hosts regular meditations, among other events. Alex Donesky ’15, who has attended meditation sessions at the house but does not consider himself to be a Buddhist, discussed the state of Buddhist life on campus. “In my past experience it seems that there are a few core practicing Buddhists and many more students who dabble here and there in the meditation sits, the classes, and the other events the community puts on,” he said. “Though the community doesn’t have extensive resources, if you’re looking, I’d recommend initially attending one of the triweekly sits at BuHo and reaching out to students there.” Donesky emphasized the openness and breadth of the Buddhist community at Wes. “You will find students with diverse backgrounds and durations in Buddhist practice who will be happy to give advice and provide community,” he said. Wesleyan is also home to a to a small but diverse community of Muslim students. Despite the recent departure of Imam Adeel Zeb from Wesleyan, the community remains a largely student-run affair. “We’ll often have a community gathering like we had growing up,” said Rizky Rahadianto ’15, a film major and the former secretary of the Muslim Students Association (MSA). “There are people from so many different countries, so we’ll bring our own dishes and eat things we’ve been eating since we were kids.” The group also hosts on-campus events to educate people about Islam and social issues. However, these events often remain under the radar for many Wesleyan students. “We used to do the Fast-a-Thon,” Rahadianto said. “It’s not just the Muslim people; it’s collaborating with other student groups to donate points for charities. It uses the value of charity in Islam. We also had coffee talks to educate the Wesleyan community about us. Mansoor [Alam, ’15] gave a talk about Islamic economies. It didn’t last that long, though. It was really interesting, but only about five people came.” The MSA plans regular prayer sessions and holiday celebrations in order to maintain a sense of community for Muslim students. “We still organize Jumua (prayer) together every Friday, and after that there is a lecture where you look at Quran together,” Rahadianto said. “It’s like a discussion or a class. And for our holidays, we usually organize a trip to the Mosque. After that, we usually go to iHop. That’s always fun.”"
"In Stitches: Pamela Roose Knits Close Community","2014-10-16","by Jenny Davis, Haenah Kwon, Opinion Editor and Staff Writer","Pamela Roose, a knitting supplies store, brings the comfort of home to the Middletown community. Haenah Kwon, staff photographer Walking into Pamela Roose is like walking into a nest: the space is warm, soft, clean, and maternal. Yarn and sample knitted items are artfully displayed in wicker cradles and hanging on mannequins. Gentle music plays in the background. We sat down with founder and owner Pamela Steele on the Middletown store’s plush yellow chairs to chat. She explained that she derived the name of her store by combining her name and her husband Roosevelt’s. “He’s my not-so-silent partner,” she joked. Pamela Roose will celebrate its fourth birthday this November, but Steele is no newcomer to the knitting scene. She began participating in craft fairs in 2002, and in November 2010 she opened her first store in the Main Street Market. In July 2013, she moved to her spacious current location at 88 Court St. Steele’s experience with yarn extends to long before this business venture began: she has been knitting for 50 years. “My grandmother taught me,” she said. “We made these little crocheted skirts, and then she taught me to knit, and I made these baby items. Then I decided I wanted to follow a pattern, so I got a ‘how to knit’ book, and the first real thing I made from following a pattern was a baby set: a hat, the mitts, the sweater. From then on, it was just the way I went.” These days, Steele knits not only for family and friends, but also on commission. Lately, knit dresses have been occupying most of her time. “I just did one for my mother, for a cruise,” she said. “It was black with sequins in it, and it had baubles, and it was very detailed. I’m actually working on one now for a customer.” Of all the things she crafts, though, Steele is most moved by christening or baptism gowns for babies and children. “For me, it’s something very, very special,” she said. “I’ve made some for friends, for customers, but for me that’s something special, that they’re baptized or christened with a handmade item and not something from the store. It’s a labor of love for me, so that’s the thing I like the most, I’d say.” But for Steele, knitting is not simply a means to an end; she loves the process itself. “For me, it’s a great stress reliever,” she said. “It keeps me focused…. It’s creative…. You can take that ball of string, as some people say, and [then] at the end of it have something not only great but functional. I can’t sit still or sit in front of a TV or movie, without my hands moving.” Steele’s love for knitting has only grown with her recently acquired knowledge of knitting’s health benefits. “It keeps your mind active,” she said. “[It] lowers blood pressure. It’s not just a habit that people thought years ago was frivolous.” At a big oval table in the center of the store, Steele teaches knitting lessons. For her, it is a way to share her passion for counting stitches and casting. “I personally would rather teach someone to knit than to make something for them because they get past the initial learning curve, and when they sit down and really realize how relaxing it can be…they come back and say, ‘I love it!’” Steele said. “That’s what excites me because it is my passion. It’s nice to share it with someone else.” If she were forced to choose one type of yarn with which to knit for the rest of her life, Steele would be sure of her answer. “Cashmere!” she cried longingly, as though pining after a lost love. “Cashmere yarn is the ultimate luxury, and it’s one of the most expensive outside of opossum. It’s the softest, it’s luxurious, it doesn’t itch…it’s like wrapping yourself in—all I can say is luxury. Just luxury.” And what does Steele see as the future of her business? She’s enamored of Webs, a 20,000-square-foot yarn facility in Northampton, Mass., and dreams of one day operating a similar business. “My dream is to become the Webs of Connecticut,” she said. Time will tell whether or not Pamela Roose will expand, but for now, Steele is content to knit together a community in Middletown. “I want this to be a place where people can come and feel comfortable and warm and like they’ve met a friend,” she said. “I just want this to be like you’ve just walked into my home.” To that end, Pamela Roose has served as a haven for recent divorcees and stressed-out University students alike. “I have people who come in from court and say, ‘I just went through a divorce, and I saw your store,’ and they sit for a few minutes and de-stress from whatever,” she said. “It’s almost like being a bartender. You tell a bartender everything, and it’s kind of the same thing. I see a lot of students right after exams. Yes, it’s a business, but for me, it’s more than that. As my youngest says, ‘My mom collects people.’” Just as every knitted item in the shop has its own story of dropped stitches and countless start-overs, Steele sees every customer as a work in progress. “I always treat everyone who comes through the door with dignity and respect because we never know what their journey is,” she said. “If somebody’s having a bad day, feel free to come in and sit. I don’t bite.”"
"This is Why: Rho Epsilon Pi","2014-10-23","by Margaux Buehl,","When I started my freshman year at Wesleyan University, I immediately noticed that despite the ample discussions on gender and social institutions, equality was not the reality. It is clear that men are in power here at Wesleyan; they own beautiful, historic mansions and are thus able to control a large portion of the social scene because of their allocation of physical spaces and resources from the affluent organizations to which they belong. However, women have no formally established social space created for and overseen by women on campus. I automatically recognized my diminished place as a woman in the social hierarchy at Wesleyan and my complete inability to control it, or feel like I have a right to be where I am: in an institution historically inhabited and still dominated by only men. The lack of female energy, community, and support at Wesleyan shocked me after going to a similarly progressive co-educational high school where women were highly respected and valued. Beginning my freshman year at Wesleyan, I felt like I did not have a place to speak as a woman, much less as an active and potentially influential female member of our community. I had few other women to look up to or ask advice about my classes, going abroad, residential life, and other critical areas that bolster a Wesleyan student’s success inside and outside the classroom. In my search to meet more female friends and have social opportunities with women, I chose to attend a rush event for the only sorority, and the only social organization by women and for women of all backgrounds at Wesleyan. When I joined Rho Epsilon Pi, I immediately felt like I had a place to belong, a sisterhood, where I was appreciated and my intellectual contributions were valued. Moreover, I met a diverse range of women–across grades, sports, races, socio-economic classes, academic and personal interests–who have created a unique community of love, support, and encouragement for the betterment of myself and my community. Above all, I learned that I could have a voice as a woman at Wesleyan and that, through the opportunities Rho Epsilon Pi presented to me–the individuals in it, and also the institution–I could make my ideas a reality and effect change. Because I joined Rho Epsilon Pi, I became involved in organizing philanthropic events like fundraising for Relay for Life, attending alcohol and sexual assault bystander intervention training, Take Back the Night, the Wesleyan Women’s Conference, and the vigil for the Board of Trustees in honor of the 100 freshmen sexually assaulted in their first two months at Wesleyan, to mention a few of the opportunities Rho Epsilon Pi has presented to me. Now, I am the Scholarship Chair with a seat on our General Board. The overwhelming majority of what I am proud to have accomplished over the last two years happened because of my involvement in Rho Epsilon Pi and how the organization and women in it influenced me and raised my awareness. Because of my sorority, I know how to reserve spaces, plan and organize events, and more importantly, to seek out resources, information, and support from this incredible community of care. The opportunities provided by this organization are indispensable and undervalued in a school where male-dominated organizations and spaces–from the new turf football field to fraternity houses–permeate the campus and only one, marginalized sorority exists. From my first rush event, and many times since then, I regarded becoming a member of Rho Epsilon Pi as the best decision I made at Wesleyan University. I also maintain that joining at the beginning of my freshmen year was integral to my success as a student because I entered a social scene that aligned with my values of friendship, community service, and social justice. I cannot express how much I value and appreciate Rho Epsilon Pi and our founding mothers for fighting to create this organization so that I could reap the same unending benefits my male counterparts and peer athletes are entitled to; to name a few examples: an alumni network that I can actually reach, friends across class years, and help balancing my academics, personal life, and extracurricular engagements. I feel profoundly grateful for having the privilege of community that my female counterparts just five years ago were deprived of while men at Wesleyan benefitted from the empowering opportunities Greek organizations create. I revel in having a safe, friendly institution controlled by women that has made me a better person and introduced me to incredible women while providing me with an environment I can positively engage in and thrive. While I was initially shocked by the negative views of Rho Epsilon Pi as a sorority, I soon realized these sentiments came from a lack of understanding and judgment based solely on insidiously sexist stereotypes. I find the backlash against Rho Epsilon Pi, both from the student body and administration during our organization’s founding and continuing to this day, problematic because of how “sorority girl” comments, even at Wesleyan, imply a dismissive and condescending perception of social groups of women. Rho Epsilon Pi has never been exclusive, never discriminated along racial or socioeconomic boundaries (we have relatively low fees compared to other Greek organizations along with financial aid options), has never been charged with sexual misconduct or for hosting dangerous, uncontrolled parties, and has never forced any member to drink or partake in humiliating or harmful behavior. In fact, despite being a new organization with no financial or networking support fro m a nationally affiliated sisterhood, we consistently raise the most money for the American Cancer Society every year at Relay for Life, work to plan and promote Take Back the Night, and co-organize alcohol and sexual assault bystander intervention training along with film screenings such as The Invisible War and After Tiller, to name just a few of our sponsored events. Through our actions and community, we aim to “redefine sorority.” Furthermore, “the mission of Rho Epsilon Pi is to cultivate the creativity, knowledge, and spiritual illumination of its members through a perpetual bond of friendship and sisterly affection to develop strong, passionate women with a commitment to leadership, moral integrity, and community service for the betterment of the individual and the world.” I simply do not understand how anyone could view this as having a negative impact on our campus. Rho Epsilon Pi’s role as both a Greek organization and a women’s support network, which helps to advocate for and provide safe spaces for our members and other female survivors of sexual assault, is an incredibly unique situation that is often unrecognized and certainly underutilized by the administration and student body. Considering our involvement in both sides of the campus climate discussion, I find it exceedingly frustrating and belittling that the only all-encompassing female organization, and also the only all-female Greek institution, on campus has been disregarded in discussions that affect us as both Greek members and as people who have been personally affected by sexual violence. As an individual empowered by my sorority to speak up for what I believe is right, and not as a voice representing Rho Ep collectively, I perceive forcing men to accept women into their homes as a mere continuation of the responsibility placed on women to change rape culture. We need more social spaces for and controlled by women–a sorority house, for instance–and a gender resource center to balance out the gendered-property power dynamic at Wesleyan. Let us create more safe spaces where all genders feel comfortable, unintimidated, and as if they have a right to be there and stand up for themselves. Changes like these would enable equal amounts of gendered spaces that empower women without encroaching on men’s equal right to a brotherhood, and would additionally balance a male-dominated social scene and hook-up culture that is evidently unsafe and oppressive for everyone. I believe we need more realistic alcohol education, training about bystander intervention and consent–how to express it, recognize it, and eliminate nonconsensual behavior, and discussions on the dynamics of a hook-up culture so closely intertwined with drinking and anonymity. These should be done in-person during orientation with mandatory attendance verified by registering names or WesIds for all freshmen classes. Students who choose not to attend should not be able to enroll online in the university, preventing them from negatively impacting our community. My involvement with Rho Epsilon Pi has encouraged me to attend these seminars, and I strongly believe they should be made mandatory to all students, not just Greek members. In instances of sexual assault, Wesleyan should move to an investigator model where evidence is reviewed within two weeks without a hearing, limiting time to prevent perpetrators from committing another assault. This policy is one that our Title IX student representatives are working towards implicating that I fully support. Rather than encouraging women into historically male spaces where the burden of change lies with an already marginalized group to amend fraternity attitudes and behavior, the changes outlined above directly address a culture that exists throughout and beyond our campus (not just in fraternities), where victim-blaming and rape culture are the norm, not the exception, and therefore rarely challenged in many of the social spaces on campus. Rho Ep has made me conscientious, involved, and above all passionate, while supporting me with the tools I need to get involved and succeed at Wesleyan. To take this incredible opportunity away from incoming freshmen fills me with despair. I know I would have had a much less positive experience socially, intellectually, and extra-curricularly during my first year if I had not met the amazing members of Rho Epsilon Pi, learned and lived our mission, and participated in such a uniquely empowering and accepting community of love that all genders should be able to have access to on a campus that values equality and progress to the degree Wesleyan claims."
"The Remote Vote: Absentee, But Not Absentminded","2014-10-23","by Taylor Leet-Otley, Staff Writer","Presented with the choice of voting absentee in their hometowns or as Middletown residents, students cast their ballots where they count most.At the dawn of a fresh round of elections, many Wesleyan students are gearing up for the polls, as are hoards of college students across the country. According to the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement, college-educated young people were among the most well-represented in the 2012 elections. College students flocked to the polls en masse, favoring Barack Obama by a 23-point margin. However, polls by the Pew Research Center after the 2012 presidential election suggested that fewer young voters registered for that election than for the previous one in 2008, down 11 points from 66 to 55 percent. Many speculated that this was partially due to diminished enthusiasm compared to the 2008 campaign, while others pointed to a slew of controversial voter ID and early registration laws that had been implemented in many states in the months leading up to the 2012 election. Nevertheless, young people traditionally show a lower turnout than their older counterparts regardless of the election, and their overall numbers in non-presidential elections have historically been much lower than in presidential elections. With elections approaching on Nov. 4, political outlets are abuzz with information about upcoming congressional, senatorial, and gubernatorial elections, including 435 seats for the biannual House election, 36 Senate seats, including 3 up for special election; and 36 governors’ offices. Among these is the race between current Democratic Governor of Connecticut Dannel Malloy and the Republican nominee Tom Foley, who lost to Malloy by a narrow margin in the 2010 gubernatorial election. Malloy visited campus in early June to commemorate the opening of Wesleyan’s new auxiliary power micro-grid, which received state funding as part of an ongoing energy project in Connecticut. For those hoping to vote in the election, voting laws in Connecticut have become a focus of controversy in recent months. Connecticut voter laws are relatively strict compared to those in other New England states, forbidding absentee voting without an approved excuse. Veronica Birdsall ’15, a resident of Litchfield, Conn., is currently registered to vote with her home address. “Honestly, they don’t really follow up on whether your excuse is legit,” Birdsall said. “Honestly [I am registered in Litchfield] mostly because I had already registered there in high school and didn’t feel like going through the process of changing it.” Birdsall also spoke in support of a referendum on the ballot in the upcoming election to ease some of Connecticut’s early voting restrictions. “[It’s] not too bad since I had an excuse,” she said. “I couldn’t come home on Election Day due to lack of transportation…. But on the ballot is an Amendment to the Connecticut constitution to implement no-excuse absentee voting! So I voted for that.” Earl Lin ’15 of New Haven, Conn. is also registered to vote in his home district. “I’ve been registered at my home address in New Haven since I turned 18 and became eligible to vote,” he said. “Since it’s only about half an hour away and I wanted to continue voting in municipal primarily, mayoral, [and] aldermanic elections at home, it seemed most convenient and to make the most sense to keep my registration in New Haven.” However, in the past, he has chosen to vote absentee. “I did vote absentee for at least one election, but since one of the reasons for requesting an absentee ballot is that one is absent from town during an election, it was pretty straightforward to request a ballot,” Lin said. “I actually didn’t realize no-excuse voting was something some states do. I think it would be better if Connecticut offered early voting, though, as absentee ballots are sometimes not even counted unless the election is close. Regardless of its impact on the election, it’s nice to know that your vote has actually been counted.” In 2012, Connecticut legislators approved a law legalizing online voting in the state. The online voter registration form is run by the Office of the Secretary of the State, and voters can use the website to register anew, as well as register with a change of address. The site closed on Thursday, Oct. 22 and will remain closed until election day. For students coming from other states, however, there is also the consideration of whether to register in their home states or in Connecticut. Andreas Streuli ’15 has voted in his home state of California for previous elections. “I voted in 2012 out of state,” he said. “San Mateo County constantly sends me materials. I think I may be registered in Connecticut now because I keep getting called for jury duty.” Streuli listed among his reasons for voting out of state a feeling that his vote would go further in California, which receives 55 electoral votes in presidential elections compared with Connecticut’s 7. “I’m afraid my reason for registering to vote in California was just because it holds quite a bit more influence than Connecticut,” Streuli said. Matthew Conley ’15 of New York, another state that tends to vote consistently Democratic in elections, echoed Streuli’s sentiments. “I’m from New York, so I’m voting between two very blue states,” Conley said. “So where I register to vote in any given race depends on who has a more competitive congressional or senatorial race in a given cycle.” Conley also expressed interest in out-of-state voting due to differences in state politics. “I volunteered for a state Senate campaign the summer between my freshman and sophomore years,” he said. “Honestly, state legislature is where important decisions are made, and state legislature in New York is weird because it’s much more heavily Republican than the state as a whole in national elections.” For students considering voting in Connecticut who have yet to register, forms can still be returned in person at the Registrar’s office by Oct. 28. Additionally, vans will be running between Usdan and local polling centers on Nov. 4 for students voting in local elections."
"Middletown Day Fosters Community Relations","2014-10-23","by Sofi Goode, News Editor","The University invites the Middletown community onto campus in an attempt to foster a relationship between the campus and city. Lianne Yun/Staff Photographer The University welcomed the Middletown community onto campus for the second annual Middletown Day on Saturday, Oct. 18. This year, Middletown Day was planned to coincide with the University’s Homecoming football game. The event included carnival activities and free entrance to the football game. Additionally, the Middletown High School Marching Band performed during halftime. The Planning Committee was composed of various University faculty from Human Resources, Alumni and Parent Relations, and the Center for Community Partnerships. Assistant Football Coach Jeff McDonald, who represented the athletics department on the committee, spoke to the role of local students in building the relationship with Middletown. The University football team currently has three local players: linebacker and wildcat quarterback Devon Carrillo ’17, wide receiver Kristopher Luster ’17, and linebacker Alec Corazzini ’16. “While not part of the committee, I spoke with all three of them informally to get their thoughts on how to best engage the community and asked for their help in promoting the event,” McDonald wrote in an email to The Argus. McDonald further emphasized the impact that local students, particularly athletes, can have on relations with the Middletown community. “There is no doubt in my mind that having local student-athletes on our roster definitely makes the community feel more connected to our team and the University,” McDonald wrote. “Since Devon, Alec and Kris have been with us, there have been a number of times that people have stopped me to ask specifically how they are doing. Recruiting wise, Coach Whalen has made it a big priority for us to not get so caught up recruiting nationally that we overlook qualified student-athletes here in Middletown and Connecticut as a whole.” Middletown Day was designed to bring Middletown community members onto the University campus and to make the campus feel more open. In an email to The Argus, Vice President for Finance and Administration and Chair of the Middletown Day Planning Committee John Meerts explained the role of a community day in achieving this goal. “Of course Wesleyan is part of the Middletown community and we do a lot in the community already through volunteer work, service learning and the like,” Meerts wrote. “But we don’t really have much of an opportunity to interact with the citizens of Middletown on the campus proper. I think that having citizens feel welcome on campus, not just for Middletown day but in general, even for a stroll or attending events, would help bridge and improve town gown relations.” University President Michael Roth agreed and elaborated on the intended effects of Middletown Day. “I am hopeful that Middletown Day will be a symbol of the openness of the campus to members of the Middletown community and that we warmly welcome folks from town on our campus as part of the process of more reciprocity between the campus and the city,” Roth said. “Middletown is a great place to go to school, it’s a great place to live, and I think as we find more ways to cooperate and share resources, it’s good for everybody.” Meerts explained why the event was held during Homecoming, as opposed to being held along with the first home football game as it was last year. “We thought that having a campus with lots of people in attendance would provide for a nice atmosphere,” Meerts wrote in an email to The Argus. “Ideally we would have had the event much like last year, with a combined family/homecoming weekend and with the students being here as well.” According to Roth, fall break and Homecoming coincided this year due to calendar restrictions. By tradition, Homecoming football games are against either Amherst College or Williams College, and fall break is restricted by a variety of holidays. Roth stated that fall break and Homecoming will coincide again in 2016, adding that the University is looking for a solution to avoid this conflict. “We could play Homecoming against Hamilton, but a lot of alumni and perhaps some students also would find that kind of [disappointing],” Roth said. “Not that Hamilton’s bad, it’s that we have this tradition of playing the Little Three.”"
"Revived Student Group Rallies Wesleyan Republicans","2014-11-03","by Jenny Davis, Matthew Wallock, Opinion Editor and Contributing Writer","The Wesleyan Republican Club aims to vary the University's political landscape and spark spirited debate. Last spring, Emmakristina Sveen ’17 and Meghan Kelly ’17 witnessed a protest outside Usdan and realized that only one political perspective was being represented. “We were actually asked to sign a physical petition,” Sveen said. “Obviously we didn’t, because we didn’t agree with what they were protesting for, but we just sort of realized that that’s something that’s so political….There’s one side of it being advertised and protested right outside the student center, and the other side is completely silenced and hidden a little bit, hushed.” From this experience, Sveen and Kelly were inspired to start the Wesleyan Republican Committee (WRC). The last incarnation of a Republican student group, the Wesleyan College Republicans, officially went under just before the 2012 presidential election. Eugene Wong ’09 founded the club in 2007, but it was Alex Levin ’12 who last headed the student group. Membership dwindled upon Levin’s graduation, and with no real leadership in place, the club disintegrated. To receive charters with the College Republican National Committee and the College Republicans of Connecticut, the current WRC established an executive board of five students and wrote a constitution. The executive board consists of Sveen (Chairman), Emma Bentley ’17 (Vice Chairman), Kelly (Treasurer), Andrew Mehr ’17 (Executive Director), and Jake Cronin ’18 (Director of Membership and Recruitment). Brooke Hodgson ’18 serves as the board’s newly added Director of Social Media. Sveen emphasized that the WRC has been embraced by other college Republican groups. “The Connecticut Republican Party, when they found out that we were starting our own chapter, jumped on the opportunity and capitalized on that,” Sveen said. “Now we’re pretty well established in terms of college Republican clubs in Connecticut, and we’re pretty well established nationally, too.” She found that the group has served as an outlet for the expression of views that may go less acknowledged on campus. “We formed the institution to give a voice to people to with conservative voices,” Sveen said. “Nobody wanted to be the one to start the committee, but there were definitely people itching to have a voice. We really want to instill in our members and other students on this campus a voice to advocate, regardless of what your political affiliations are, regardless of whether Wesleyan is known as being a liberal institution.” The presence of an institutionalized Republican student group on campus challenges both internal and external perceptions of the University’s political landscape. Thw mainstream media regularly portrays the University as a hotbed of liberalism, with College Magazine ranking the University #4 on its 2014 list of “The 10 Most Progressive Campuses.” However, contrary to popular belief, Wesleyan is home to students of many political identities, beliefs, and affiliations. Within three weeks, the WRC has amassed a listserv of over 70 students. Sveen, though, is hardly shocked. “Just the fact that we established this club, and we already have a member base of over 70 students, does indicate that this campus is politically diverse,” she said. She noted that despite this success, political diversity doesn’t necessarily correlate to political activism. “I don’t know if you can really consider something politically diverse if not every side speaks up and advocates,” Sveen said. “Being a Republican at Wesleyan, it didn’t surprise me that there were other people who also chose to come here and live under the big liberal umbrella here,” Sveen she added. “But I definitely surprised a lot of other people. When I say we have [70] people, it usually tends to provoke shock.” Sveen acknowledged that political beliefs are more complicated than party affiliations. “We also think it is really important to talk about politics in terms of a spectrum, particularly with this younger generation of voters,” Sveen wrote in an email to The Argus. “There are undoubtedly both extreme liberals and extreme conservatives on this campus, but there is also a huge presence of very intellectual and well-informed students that fall everywhere and anywhere in between.” Sveen also pointed out that political diversity exists within the WRC itself. “We do have a lot of people in our club who are absolutely very conservative, but we also have people who are very, very moderate,” she said. Marshal Lawler ’16, President of the Wesleyan College Democrats, looks forward to a broader representation of political voices. “A lot of people on campus assume that there’s a consensus surrounding [political] debates…and that’s very much not the case, especially when it comes to things like economic policy around the country,” he said. “That being said, I’m a Democrat and think that Republicans are wrong about most things, but that doesn’t mean that I don’t think they have a place in the political discourse. There are good and bad ideas on both sides of the political aisle.” Lawler believes that the formation of a conservative student group could actually lead to increased political engagement among liberal students. “Because there’s no competition [at Wesleyan], a lull forms, and people don’t feel the need to engage as thoroughly, because they don’t realize that these ideas are threatened at all, and they don’t feel the need to defend them,” he said. “So there’s not as much political engagement, at least in traditional mainstream politics, as I’d like to see. I would like to see more engagement on Wesleyan’s campus, especially if it is as liberal as people say. I think that healthy competition will actually make people come out and participate more, which I’m really excited for.” Mitchell Ryan ’17, a member of the WRC, agrees that political uniformity can result in complacency. “The best political environment is to have all sides of the issue,” he said. “With one side, people get comfortable with their views. They’re not ever challenged.” Bentley, like Lawler, hopes that the formation of WRC will bring about changes in Wesleyan’s political discourse. “It is crucial to have multiple political views on every college campus,” Bentley wrote in an email to The Argus. “In the ‘real world’ (after college) there are multiple political views being preached wherever you go, [so] why should Wesleyan be any different? It is unrealistic to have an environment where only one political view is heard because that leaves no room for discussion or debate….We hope the formation of WesRepubs allows for greater political diversity, more bipartisan community events, heavy debates revolving current political events, and simply a broader Wesleyan political spectrum of views that can be heard and expressed in a formal setting.” For some students, the WRC has already provided exposure to new ideas. “We’ve had people come up to us and say, ‘I was raised one hundred percent liberal—parents are liberal, came straight to Wesleyan, and I’ve never been exposed to the Republican ideas and would love to just come and listen. I’m not going to say I’m going to change my registration, but I want to listen,’” Sveen said. Despite encountering this open-mindedness among students, the WRC board members have yet to find a faculty sponsor. The Wesleyan College Republicans of 2007-2012 faced the same challenge and never found a faculty sponsor. “It’s difficult to find faculty [members] who are sympathetic to our cause or faculty members [who] have the time,” Sveen said. “We are still in the process of looking, and [Bentley] is reaching out to two different professors this week who were recommended to her. We really want a faculty member who won’t just sign off on our forms, but somebody who has similar views and is similarly conservatively minded, and will participate in our club and participate in our discussions and participate in our debates.” The WRC meets every Wednesday at 8 p.m. in PAC004. Last week, attendees spoke about Second Amendment rights in relation to gun violence and gun control. “The discussion could not have been more successful,” Sveen said. “We all had our own opinions about gun laws and gun control, but we also all had questions.” Meetings have been attended by die-hard conservatives along with people who are on the fence politically. Though its members identify as Republican, the WRC plans to hold events open to everybody, regardless of political affiliation. “One thing we thought would resonate on campus is to have representatives from the National Federation of Republican Women,” Sveen said. “One of the things I hear all the time is, ‘Why are you a Republican?’ and ‘the Republican war against women.’ I obviously do not believe that there’s a war against women, and as a female Republican and as a female leader in the Republican Party on my own campus, I think it would be really inspirational and educational to hear from someone who works in a coalition that’s just for Republican women.” Sveen also pointed out that the top positions on the executive board of the WRC are occupied by women, a fact that distinguishes the group from most other college Republican committees. She hopes that female speakers—along with speaker from Connecticut Black Republicans and Conservatives—will challenge stereotypes about Republicans. Hannah Skopicki ’18, a member of the WRC, enjoys prompting others to question their notions of the quintessential Republican when she explains her own political views to them. “I think that when you get a Jewish girl from New York, that’s not exactly the stereotypical Republican that everyone thinks of,” she said. Because most college students vote Democratic, Sveen—along with the National Republican Party, which was, she reports, thrilled to see the formation of the WRC at the University—is working to reclaim the youth vote. “Statistically speaking, a significant percentage of Americans admit to not affiliating with Republicans because of the party’s perception, not so much the actual policies,” she said. Bentley hopes to confront these perceptions. “We hope to not only educate students about the Republican agenda, but to break down and explore the stigma around the Republican Party in hopes that the youth of our generation is attracted to this newly refurbished notion of a more moderate Republican,” she said. According to Lawler, there is also an increasing number of libertarians on campus. “Especially because right now is a time when the president is unpopular in his sixth year; most presidents are,” Lawler said. “Identifying as Republican, or at least someone who disagrees with the president and the party in power, is more common than people would think.” Still, the WRC’s existence has generated a blend of shock and contempt from people on campus. The group has been the object of curiosity and animosity on social media. Lawler condemns the hateful responses. “I’ve noticed, especially since the formation of the group, that some people have been really hostile on social media,” Lawler said. “And I haven’t been too happy with that, just because they haven’t even gotten the chance to exist yet.” On Oct 22, the WRC ran a campaign called #whyiam, in which members stood in front of a blackboard stating, “I am a Republican because…” with pieces of paper proclaiming things such as, “I don’t believe in a Socialistic America,” “I want a job after college,” and “I want to keep what I work for.” Sveen noted that part of the hostility provoked by the campaign was due to a misunderstanding of the project’s aims. “I didn’t fully explain what the campaign was, and it was misconstrued a little bit,” she said. “It wasn’t detailed, it wasn’t substantive; it was just one aspect of the Republican party that people agree with the most, something they’d take to the grave. And some people tried to make the words a little casual, or funny, and it was misconstrued.” Despite the response, Sveen sees the campaign as a worthy exercise in self-reflection. “We’re doing stuff like that to get people to think to themselves, ‘Why am I a Republican? What is it about the Republican agenda that I agree with? Or do I even know; was it just that I was raised as a Republican?’” she said. The WRC has received nothing but respect, however, from WesDems, according to Sveen. “WesDems as a club has been unbelievably supportive,” Sveen said. “Obviously we disagree on many points—our political views are almost completely opposite—but they’ve been our biggest supporters.” That support stems from a mutual belief in political discourse. “Both sides are like, ‘This is not a contentious thing,’” Sveen said. “This is the nature of our country and our political system. Best to embody that at our school, considering that we’re the next generation of voters.” Sveen and Lawler are particularly excited about the possibility of co-hosting debates. “People in my club have always wished the debate were a possibility,” Lawler said. “Politics without anyone to argue with is kind of boring….I would like to see the discourse continue, maybe at a higher level than it does, say, in Congress.” The bottom line for Lawler, though, is greater political engagement. “I would like to see everyone on campus come out there and get engaged,” he said. “Supposedly Wesleyan is this politically engaged community, and we do have a very active activist community, but when it comes to mainstream politics, people aren’t very enthusiastic.” Sveen agrees that getting involved in politics is paramount. “We’re really trying to give people that voice and re-establish that two-sided environment,” she said. “People are really excited to go out and say, ‘I’ve held this in for however many years at Wesleyan, and now I have the vehicle to advocate for what I believe in.’”"
"WESU Celebrates 75th Anniversary","2014-11-03","by Courtney Laermer, Assistant News Editor","WESU received a Proclamation from the City of Middletown at its celebration on Sunday evening. Bebe LeGardeur/Contributing Photographer An air of celebration and the scents of freshly delivered food filled the Daniel Family Commons (DFC) on the evening of Sunday, Nov. 2, as WESU kicked off an official commemoration of the radio station’s 75th anniversary. State Representatives Matt Lesser and Joe Serra presented the WESU Board of Directors with a citation, while Middletown Mayor Daniel Drew and Councilmen Grady Faulkner and David Bauer awarded the station a Proclamation from the City of Middletown. WESU is one of the oldest operating non-commercial radio stations in the United States. According to President of the WESU Board of Directors Danielle Pruitt ’15, there are approximately 50 community members involved with the station, as well as more than 150 student DJs. In addition to broadcasting at 88.1 on the FM dial, WESU streams its on-air programming online. The event began with a presentation of the Olin Memorial Library exhibition, “WESU: Celebrating 75 Years of Community Radio.” Showcased here were historical photographs, documents, clippings, and artifacts. Several items on display were from the Special Collections and Archives at Olin Library, while others were dug up from archives at the station itself. Immediately following this, a reception opened in the DFC featuring food donated by local restaurants. This led into a presentation kicked off by Ben Michael, WESU’s General Manager. The WESU Board of Directors presented a video on the station’s history, put together by Production Director Abigail Shneyder ’17. The video featured photos spanning from the station’s founding to the present, archived audio footage, and clips from a video interview with Archibald Doty, Jr., who started the radio station in Clark Hall in 1939. “I’m really excited to be a part of this,” Pruitt said. “For me, being at the station has been one of the best things I’ve ever done at Wesleyan. It’s been so fun, and it’s interactive. Having a radio show really allows you to learn your own skills in journalism, broadcasting, and all that tangible stuff you don’t often get in the classroom.” Furthermore, Pruitt and Vice President of the WESU Board of Directors Rebecca Seidel ’15 spoke about the station’s missions. “Part of our mission is to emphasize the opposite of top forty, because mainstream radio is the same five songs over and over again,” Pruitt said. “But here we really encourage people to find that hidden gem and find something that people may not already be exposed to, and to fall in love, and then spread the love.” Following the film, Drew came up to the podium and spoke about the significance of independent media. “I used to be in media myself,” Drew said. “The things you learn and the relationships you develop in university media are extraordinary and it gives you lessons that will stick with you for the rest of your lives…. You guys are here, volunteering and working for the station at a very important time in history, a time when media organizations have been consolidated under the corporate banners of maybe two or three gigantic mega-corporations. The diversity in programming and diversity of viewpoints available to the mass audience out there is limited compared to what it used to be.” Lesser, who attended Wesleyan and now represents Connecticut’s 100th district in the General Assembly, added how revolutionary he believes the station is. “This radio station is one of the pre-set radio stations in my car radio,” Lesser said. “I never know what I’m going to hear, but it has done such a wonderful job of supporting this University and the city, bringing the two together. I don’t know what we would do without it.” Public Affairs Director Laura Werle ’15 expressed her excitement for this acknowledgement. “It’s very exciting because the 75th anniversary spans two academic years,” Werle said. “It’s nice because both the outgoing seniors from last year and the incoming freshmen from this year get exposed to this special program we’re having and all of the special events, this fall in particular. Especially after all of the work that was put in last year [by board members], it’s nice to have a culminating event like this with so many exciting visitors.” As Public Affairs Director, Werle explained that she has numerous different roles at the station. “The FCC requires that we tell them the topic of all of the public affair shows we have, so I do a lot of recording,” Werle said. “But because that’s pretty minimal, it’s nice because I can [help out] wherever there is a spot that needs to be taken up. It’s kind of nice to not have to spearhead things, but to fill in the gaps. I get to have my fingers in all different parts of the board. It’s nice just to feel like I’m helping out when there is no one else available to.” At the end of the event, Director of the Center for Community Partnerships Cathy Lechowicz and WESU General Manager Ben Michael spoke about the role of WESU in cultivating community engagement. “I also oversee the Center for Prison Education,” Lechowicz said. “One thing that we’re proud of is that the WESU station program guide is actually prominently displayed in our classroom. It is a constant reminder to me in terms of the service [WESU] provides to disenfranchised populations, whether that it’s that they’re literally removed from our communities or culturally may not have a touch point, and you provide a voice to folks that are often forgotten about. And I’m proud of the fact that [WESU] does that.” Pruitt added that one of her favorite aspects of working for WESU is its diverse body of listeners. “The station attracts so many different facets of the community,” Pruitt said. “There are people of all years, all walks of life, all interests. You have people really into music, people really into public affairs and current events, people really into giving advice and stuff like that. Literally anything you would be interested in listening to is available at the station.”"
"Who Wore it Wes: Monica Kornis ’15","2014-11-12","by Gavriella Wolf, Staff Writer","Monica Kornis ’15 hails from Missouri but dresses for the future.Gavriella Wolf/Staff Writer By Gavriella Wolf Staff Writer   Monica Kornis ’15 has tailored her style over her years at Wesleyan, borrowing ideas from the past and future to inspire her own. Though she doesn’t quite dress like a “country girl,” Kornis is a Missouri native who praises her hometown as a haven for thrift shopping. The English major (who also touts a film minor) looked critically at her own sources of inspiration and shared them with The Argus.   The Argus: To what extent you consider yourself interested in fashion? Monica Kornis: I guess like as a mode of self-expression. I don’t, like, keep up with trends or anything; there’s people that inspire me that I see in movies, and pop culture, etc., but I don’t look up the latest trends or what was on the runway. I don’t keep track of any brands particularly.   A: How long have you been interested in the way you dress? MK: As long as I can remember, I guess. I think like, when you’re younger, you look at clothes, and they’re all fanciful and you’re like, “Oh, I want this, I want this, I want this,” and so that’s always kind of what happens.   A: Describe your personal style in three to five words. MK: I really like futuristic fashion, but I don’t really know if that’s my style. Things that are shiny, not things you would normally see. I guess I’m just attracted to shiny things. I like shiny things, I like leather. But I also like to be kind of minimalistic; I like wearing blacks, grays, whites. I don’t like my outfits being over-the-top. Okay, that’s three!   A: What do you like or dislike about style at Wesleyan? MK: I think people follow, like there are people [who are] really trendy at Wesleyan, which can be a good and bad thing. I guess being trendy is like having others dictate what you wear, but also it says that you care what you look like, which is nice. So there [are] pros and cons of each, but I think that’s one of the things.   A: How has your style changed, if at all, since you came to Wesleyan? MK: I think my style might be a little more mature, I guess, since I came to Wesleyan. Just because it comes with getting older. Like when I was first at Wesleyan, I wore a lot of floral stuff, I wore a lot of grandma sweaters. I think maybe I kind of found what I like, as opposed to when I came to Wesleyan, I’d just like wear anything that I found in the store that I thought was interesting. But now I try to match things more and piece outfits together more effectively.   A: Where are your favorite places to get your clothes? MK: I usually do all my shopping online. I go to like Etsy, eBay; when I go back home to Missouri I go to thrift stores and they’re amazing. It’s beautiful, because all these old women give away their clothes, and people in Missouri have a very different sense of fashion than they do here, so no one wants them. But then you can get things at thrift stores in Missouri for like, a dollar, and it’s amazing.   A: Who would design your dream wardrobe? MK: I guess I would like to design my dream wardrobe given that I had the appropriate skills, which I don’t. But I would like to design it myself and then have someone else implement that.   A: Where do you draw style inspiration from on campus? MK: Pretty much everyone I see. Like, if I see someone wearing something really interesting, then I’ll catalogue in my mind. I think everyone does that, they just catalogue things they see online and on campus, and it all meshes together, and that’s how people create their own personal styles. I think everyone kind of makes their own style; I just draw inspiration from everything and everyone I see.   A: Where do you draw style inspiration from off campus? MK: I draw inspiration from old film actresses from the silent era. I guess that’s kind of opposite of futuristic but a lot of them have dramatic makeup, and dark eyebrows, and wear black gowns, and I think that’s really interesting. And then, I think, Nico from the Velvet Underground, I think she has great style. And then Bjork is one of the people that isn’t afraid to do whatever she wants and wear crazy outfits, and I feel like that’s commendable.   A: What would you like to see more of in the fashion scene at Wesleyan? MK: I see people that create their own style but then again, they just like buy from Urban [Outfitters] and American Apparel, and I wish I’d see more people just like, break away from that, buy different things, and cultivate their style. I guess one of my pet peeves when it comes to fashion is you see something at an outfitters that really looks good on a mannequin, and people just buy a really similar outfit. Like, at least make something. I like it more when people have their own personal touch.   A: How do you think your style is going to change when you graduate and leave the Wesleyan bubble? MK: I guess it’d become more minimalistic. I think we’re in the stage where we can experiment and do whatever we want, and people won’t really judge us. But once we leave Wesleyan, I feel like we’re gonna be forced to conform more, because we’ll have jobs and won’t be able to wear crazy makeup or like, do our hair in the kind of ways we do it now. And so this is like a stage where we can experiment, and then we [will] have to conform, and then when I’m old, I’ll just like go wild. Because people don’t really care, [they] can be like, “Oh she’s senile, it doesn’t really matter.”"
"Professor’s Bookshelf: Victoria Pitts-Taylor","2014-11-13","by Jess Zalph, Features Editor","Victoria Pitts-Taylor, new chair of the FGSS program, discusses the power of books, the role of FGSS on campus, and the possibility that she is Harry Potter. Victoria Pitts-Taylor, Professor of Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies (FGSS) and the new chair of the program, considers herself a “sociologist of the body.” This comes through in the name of the class she is teaching this semester, FGSS 321: BioFeminisms: Science, Matter, Agency. Pitts-Taylor sat down with The Argus to discuss the importance of reading, feminism in the realm of science, and her indifference toward Billy Joel. The Argus: What’s on your bookshelf? Victoria Pitts-Taylor: I love this question, especially since right now I am still moving into my office. I have boxes of books in my trunk, and I carry one up each class. But what am I reading right now? I read a wide variety of things but usually at night I read fiction. I’m reading Olive Kitteridge at the moment. It’s this novel in stories. And that’s what I love about it the most, other than that the writing is wonderful and that the prose is just excellent; it’s also short stories and a novel at the same time. I love the short story form, but one always has this sense of loss at the end of a short story. I wait every week for The New Yorker to come, and I read the short story every single time, and once it’s over, it’s over, and you have to say goodbye to the characters and the writing style and the world that you entered, and that’s it. So even though I really love the form, I hate the brevity of the short story, so this is the perfect fit for me. It’s got the short story form in each chapter and yet the commitment to the characters and the scene and the setting of the tone over the long haul. So it’s my dream leisure reading.   A: Are you reading anything for your academic life that you find interesting? VPT: Yes! I just read this paper by Loïc Wacquant, who is a sociologist who is pretty well known for having worked with Pierre Bourdieu, who is a really famous French sociologist, and he took Bourdieu’s concept of “habitus” and did an ethnography to explore that. Habitus is the idea that we learn culture through body practices, that culture becomes embodied…. And Wacquant took this idea and applied it to an ethnographic study of boxers. So he hung out in this really working class, or poor, neighborhood in Chicago and watched people learn how to box, and he found habitus there. He has written a new paper for a journal called Qualitative Sociology on what he thinks sociologists should undertake, which he calls enactive ethnography. He argues that enactive ethnography is a way of exploring the world, doing what we normally call participant observation, but he wants to do observant participation. He really wants sociologists to get into the world, roll up their sleeves, and learn the skills and competencies of people that they are studying so that they basically become the phenomenon that they are studying. I was asked to comment on this paper… and I was asked to respond to it for two reasons. One, because I am a sociologist of the body; I write about body practices. And two, because Wacquant uses some naturalized philosophy and embodied mind theory, which draws from neuroscience, in order to make his argument. So he’s mentioning people such as Antonio Damasio, and George Lakoff, and Mark Johnson, and Andy Clark, and I’ve recently been writing about those same folks. So I’ve been reading Wacquant’s piece and writing a response to that that takes a feminist angle on both body practices and the limits of being able to become “other,” the phenomenon that you are studying.   A: You said you are a sociologist of the body. Is that what drew you to the Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Program? VPT: Yeah, I think so. I just got to Wesleyan. I was at CUNY for 15 years and started out in the sociology program in 1999 as an assistant professor at Queens College, and eventually I worked my way up and began teaching doctoral students in sociology in 2005 at the graduate center, and eventually I got asked to run the Women’s Studies program there. I had been writing a little about gender here and there, but I really got involved in thinking about gender studies as a discipline—or as an interdiscipline—when I took on that role. So I did that for five years, and I also co-edited a journal called “Women’s Studies Quarterly,” and I co-taught a class with a Victorianist, and we taught together feminist thinking from Wollstonecraft and onwards. I think my interest in the body has been very sociological but also deeply invested in issues of difference. So gender, and sexuality, and race, and class: the different ways our bodies and body practices both reflect those differences that are broader social differences and also in some ways contest them.   A: I know feminism can be a tricky subject and is talked about a lot on campus. How would you define feminism? VPT: I think feminism is a perspective. It’s a lens through which to see the world, and it’s one that has a long history, and so it’s also in that sense a perspective with its own language and own concepts. They all seem to revolve around issues of power and inequality, rooted in the power and inequality surrounding gender. But also far extending beyond gender to think about the multiple ways in which people experience power relationships. So extended into transnational issues and issues of citizenship and race and class, too.   A: You’re teaching FGSS 321: BioFeminisms: Science, Matter, Agency this semester. Could you explain the relationship between biology and feminism? VPT: I love that question. I’ve spent the entire semester with my students trying to define the term “BioFeminism,” which I just made up for the class, and we keep coming up with different answers. Essentially, feminism has an interesting relationship with the biological sciences. For a long time in the ’70s and the ’80s, a lot of feminist work was really arguing against biology. Biology offered, at least from the perspective of feminists, a fixed account of sex difference that was rooted in nature, rooted in evolution, rooted in reproduction, and feminists built a lot of their early work contesting biology, contesting a biological account and arguing for the significance of sociality and culture. So for feminists in those second wave days, the cultural and the social were what made sex differences count as gender differences. And I think times have changed over the past 40 years, and quite early on there were many feminists who were trained as scientists who felt very isolated from their non-feminist peers in the sciences and also from feminists who didn’t know enough about the sciences. Anne Fausto-Sterling is a good example of someone who was writing in the late ‘80s and ‘90s, and Linda Birke and many other people who were interested in science and trying to figure out how we could have a valid scientific account of the world that was also responsible to the criticisms. Feminists had brought these epistemological criticisms that said that scientists bring their own orientations and biases to observing the natural world, and so the whole course was set up to try to set up the relationship between epistemology, or how we know the world, and ontology, the essence of the world. And all sorts of different ways in which feminists have wrangled with that.   A: What role do you see the FGSS program playing on the Wesleyan campus? VPT: I think FGSS is a program that offers support to all of the student groups who are doing their own activism and engagement. So, for example, we are constantly giving, and co-sponsoring, and funding student-led projects across the campus, whether they’re involved with activism or bringing performers and speakers. We have a group of students who are producing their own zine, so we support those projects. We also bring an academic coherence for many students who are interested in majoring in Feminist, Gender, [and] Sexuality Studies, and they use the major [the FGSS program] as a way to make sense of their interests and this topic that’s often very interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary. We help students construct a theme or a concentration, and each carves a path, often in conjunction with another major that helps them think about what sort of interests they have and what they want to bring their sex, gender, and sexuality lens to bear on in the world, whether it is literature or history, or transnational issues, or technology, or body topics, or health and illness, or anthropology, and on and on. I also hope that we’ll increasingly provide events that help bring people together from all these different places on the campus… We’re also going to run a series of events on the theme of social death and survival: race, class, gender, and vulnerability… I see us as glue, one source of community glue, a site to bring together all of these different groups and interests, academic and non-academic interests in gender and sexuality.   A: What is one thing you hope students take away from courses here? VPT: That’s really a hard question. Our students are extremely good at critique. They have a really strong critical muscle in their brain, and I want students to also become comfortable with positive critique, and creating innovations, so that they feel that they can not only tell me what’s wrong with the world and with the text that they are reading but also what is right about it and be able to envision possibilities.   A: Have any books been particularly inspirational to you along this path? VPT: Zadie Smith’s “White Teeth.” I love that book, and I’ve actually taken a few pages of it, Xeroxed them, and passed them around in several of my classes because it’s this wonderful example of intersectionality theory and the coming together of race, class, and gender and how that can be very complicated. It’s also just beautifully written. I really think that is one of my favorite books. I love novels and short stories, and I think in a different life I would have tried to be a writer, but at the time I was considering that, I wasn’t talented enough to have the guts to do it. I find fiction to be kind of a lifesaver. When I was a little kid in a stressed-out household, I made this little room under the stairs. There was a storage area with no windows or anything, and I dragged a lamp in there and a sleeping bag.   A: I think you may be Harry Potter. VPT: I think so! I mean, I wasn’t locked in there, but I hid in there with books, and I think books have saved me through all the hard times in my life and they’ve also become friends. I’m really grateful to people who write and who are good writers, and increasingly I’ve gotten interested in creative nonfiction. I’m always amazed when I read really good magazine writing, and that blows my mind. I’m a big fan of The New Yorker because it’s always supported the short story, but lately I’ve come to realize that they have got some really good writers producing the creative nonfiction. I find myself reading articles about topics I couldn’t care less about, like golf and NASCAR, or—Oh gosh, I read this article recently about Billy Joel, and I couldn’t care less about Billy Joel, but the writing was good. I find that these magazine writers, when they are good, they can really make you care about something. Also, I want to plug in for radio listening. Because I have a long commute now, I’ve been listening to podcasts, like “This American Life.” It’s really amazing. I’m kind of a junkie now."
"In Lieu of Books, Libraries Lend a Helping Hand","2014-11-17","by Taylor Leet-Otley, Staff Writer","Although libraries are seen by many as outdated, their role has been changed, not eliminated. Trisha Arora/Staff Photographer “What do students do when they’re in the library, how do they use the library, what are their reading habits, I’m not sure about that,” said Kendall Hobbes, the University’s head Reference Librarian. “I see them in here, but I don’t know exactly what they’re doing or why.” For decades, campus libraries have served an obvious purpose: to provide books to students, particularly for research papers. And while the University’s libraries are well-stocked with books on almost every subject imaginable, the Internet allows easy access to the very same (if not more) information. As a result, many students who regularly do schoolwork at libraries seldom take out books. “Honestly I just come here at night to use my laptop and get stuff from Weshop,” said one student who preferred to remain anonymous, posted up in a chair overlooking Andrus field with a familiar white paper bag of candy and a silver 13” MacBook. “I feel like a lot of people do that.” Indeed, wandering the floors of Olin or SciLi late at night, one is apt to notice that laptops seem to outnumber books by a wide margin; the clattering of tiny keyboards is a constant backdrop to work in these spaces, and outlets are in near-constant demand in both. But looks can be deceiving, and while it appears that many students use the libraries primarily as study spaces, a great deal of students use a greater range of resources that the libraries have to offer. The libraries on campus may not lend out books with the same frequency as they did, say, a decade ago, but they extend beyond the standard purpose of supplying books to students, and have increasingly expanded their roles. Sam Rispaud ’15, who works regular shifts at the front desk of SciLi, described the demands students make of their library workers on an average day. Rispaud explained that his duties include both guiding people to library resources and helping them with other needs. “A lot of people have a hard time finding books upstairs,” he said. “After all, Wesleyan doesn’t offer courses on the Dewey Decimal System so this can be pretty daunting for some.” Demand for library assistance seems to be great enough to merit two people on library staff at any time. “There are usually two student workers on shift at a time, so if I can’t figure something out it’s great having someone else there to help,” he said. “If both of us are stuck, Linda Hurteau and Melissa Behney are the go-to science librarians that are really knowledgeable and love helping students.” However, just as common, if not more so, are requests for help with printers, another significant reason for many students to use the libraries on campus. “Other common questions revolve around using the printers,” Rispaud said. “A ton of people don’t know that you can log onto the ITS website and download an application that lets you print from your laptop.” However, during particularly busy periods such as during finals periods, it seems that all pretenses of library function are dropped in favor of a shared study space where students can cram until late at night. “Finals week gets pretty ridiculous because SciLi is open 24 hours,” Rispaud said. “This means that we have to staff student workers at all times. Seniors and juniors are able to pick up some good shifts but a lot of underclassmen get stuck working the graveyard shifts from 2 to 6 a.m. Last year I came in for an 8 a.m. shift during finals week to find one of our workers asleep under the coats in the lost-and-found. We also had someone work a 12 a.m. to 12 p.m. shift. He brought his sleeping bag and camped out in the DVD room.” But while many students use the library as something more akin to a study space, other students seem to use the full range of what Wesleyan’s libraries have to offer. Rachel Hirsch ’15, who is currently in the process of writing a senior thesis, spends a great deal of time in Olin for the research process. “[It’s] hard to go more when you’re already there all the time,” Hirsch joked. In addition, Hirsch makes extensive use of library resources such as the Inter-Library Loan (ILL) system and the CTW (Connecticut College, Trinity College, and Wesleyan University) consortium catalogue. “ILL and CWT, WTC? TCW? forever,” Hirsch said with strained enthusiasm. Even students who don’t have thesis-sized research projects seem to make good use of library resources. Hobbes described the changing ways in which the library meets students’ needs in an era of internet databases and fast research. “We keep statistics on how many people we meet, and where and how,” Hobbes said. “The reference desk, that’s been a traditional library thing for about as long as there have been libraries. Traffic there has gone down. That’s been the case in academic libraries everywhere for several years, but it’s only been the last few years that our statistics have gone down. That’s probably due to a lot of the questions people used to have can now be answered pretty easily with Wikipedia, things like that.” However, there are still questions for which students require more hands-on assistance, and the reference desk has continued to assist students with research even as Internet searches have become increasingly ubiquitous. “A lot of people come in [with] more in-depth things,” Hobbes said.“‘I’ve got to write a paper… and my professor wants to be impressed with a lot of good articles, so how do I find those?’ So that’s how we get used. We do have our personal reserve session service that we offer which is pretty popular. This week particularly I had quite a lot, and all of us have had [a lot]. It’s a popular service among students.” When approached by students, the librarians are generally happy to assist. “We like doing it too, because you come up with lots of interesting things to study, and as I like to tell students, we get learn things, too,” Hobbes said. “And we don’t have to write the papers, so it’s the best of both worlds for us.” However, the libraries resources are not limited to just books, as students make frequent use of resources that cannot be found anywhere else. Even after the Davison Art Library closed last year, formerly housed in a distinctive pink building in the CFA, students have continued to access the art records and manuscripts now housed in the Olin library. “One of the things we say to other librarians when we see each other is that you come in and you think you’ve got your day planned, then you open up your email and all of the sudden, oh my gosh, all these questions coming at me,” Susanne Javorsky, the university’s art librarian, said, sitting in her office on Olin’s second floor. “That just throws you way off.” Javorsky said that her move from the old Art Library to Olin has changed the role she plays and the way she interacts with the students, because her office is no longer centrally located. At the Art Library, encounters with students were more serendipitous, whereas now they are more structured. “If I heard students asking fellow students questions…I could intercept and get the student asking the question on the right track. What’s going to happen here is…people make appointments and we work one-on-one, or professors [send] students to me directly, or professors [ask] me to come to the class and do a presentation,” Javorsky said. Indeed, the demise of the Art Library has done little to curb the demand for the art collection on campus. Javorsky described how both students and Middletown residents alike make use of the library’s art collections. “Occasionally there are students who are working on their individual interests, and just need some assistance as to what place is going to bring up stuff faster than their groping around,” she said. “I’ll get questions from people who are not students—people who are Middletown community members, not just Wesleyan. And they’ll usually call or come in, or [I’ll get] quirky email questions too. So it’s kind of a mix.” However, the loss of the Art Library space has made it more difficult to tell exactly how University resources are being used. “I could tell in the other library because it was all a nice convenient spot and easy to walk around,” she said. “[Students] would come in, you could see what was left on the tables…and there was a way we could tell which of the current periodicals…were being used. I can’t do that there.” However, although it takes more effort, Javorsky continues to try and track students’ use of the materials. “I do see people coming in and looking at stuff, and I’ll do a quick walk through the room next door and see a pile of art books so I know people are using [them]…[and] I do see the return trucks downstairs when I’m walking in or going into the stacks or the return shelves. I can see that stuff’s getting used, which is encouraging.” Indeed, it seems that while students’ library habits are shifting and at times enigmatic, they at least run the gamut from benign use of a shared study space to in depth engagement with library resources."
"Students Respond to Grand Jury Decision in Ferguson, MO","2014-12-04","by Rebecca Seidel, Courtney Laermer, Assistant News Editor and Editor-in-Chief","Following the grand jury decision not to indict Darren Wilson, students established a grieving space with a moment of silence in Usdan.Gabe Rosenberg, Arts Editor In light of the Ferguson, Mo. grand jury decision on Monday, Nov. 24 not to indict police officer Darren Wilson in the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown, members of the University community are organizing an open discussion about the current situation. The conversation will take place in the Vanguard Lounge of the Center for African American Studies on Friday, Dec. 5 at 6:15 p.m. Moderated by Dean for Diversity and Student Engagement Renee Johnson-Thornton, Dreisen Heath ’15, and Armani White ’15, the discussion will cover the specifics of the case as well as strategies for moving forward. “The ultimate outcome of this discussion is for it to be only the starting point for a series of conversations that the community of Wesleyan publicly [partakes] in regarding the pandemic of police misconduct, themes of racism, the worth of black bodies, and what it takes to combat institutions of oppression,” Heath wrote in an email to The Argus. “We would like people to leave educated on the specifics of Ferguson and the larger topic of police brutality. We want to offer a space where people can come together and process the injustice of America in one place.” The three moderators organized this discussion along with Monique Siaw ’16 and Jasmine Mack ’16. Immediately following the grand jury decision, University students moved quickly to establish a space for grieving, solidarity, and conversation. At 11 a.m. on Tuesday, Nov. 25, students in Usdan and in classrooms participated in a moment of silence. From the late morning to the early afternoon, students in Usdan painted these statements and many more onto green and pink posters. At the foot of the stairs leading to the dining area, students stood in a silent line, each holding a sign of their own. Outside the building, it took two people to support a large banner: “Black Lives Matter.” Christopher Caines ’16, who assisted in organizing Tuesday’s events, said that there was a lot of discussion among people on campus about an appropriate response to the jury’s decision. Students are planning a more in-depth conversation on Friday, Dec. 5, but in the meantime, they wanted to foster a space for reflection before Thanksgiving break. “People were up all night doing this, trying to get everything together, trying to make it an inclusive thing,” Caines said. “It’s too easy for the campus to get swept up into, ‘I’m going on Thanksgiving break. Yeah, it’s really sad that that happened and whatever, but I’m going to go get turkey.’ And while this is just a token, not a super substantial thing, it’s something.” The students organizing Tuesday’s events decided to focus on reflection rather than any specific action. “We felt that mixing grieving and action in the same space could present some challenges,” Caines said. “We were a little bit uncomfortable with it. We’re taking email addresses, and we’re going to create [an email list] that we can plan future events from.” Siaw, who also helped to organize the grieving space, participated in a moment of silence during her African American Literature class on Tuesday morning. “We were in a large circle in front of PAC just for [about] four minutes, in complete silence,” Siaw said. “A few people said some words while we were in the circle, basically stating that this is something that people have to deal with on a regular basis. Even if you’re not a person of color, this is something that you need to understand that people of color are going through on campus, and this could have easily been someone’s brother, cousin, family member.” Caines stressed that Tuesday’s grieving space arose from a collaborative effort. “It’s very much a random collection of individuals who have come together to make this happen,” he said. “There’s no individual student group behind it or anything like that…. We’re trying to have everybody speak for themselves in the best way possible.” Amy Zhang ’15 added that she felt it was necessary to provide a place for people to use writing as a tool to express their thoughts. “Some people found it hard to come up with the words, which is so understandable,” Zhang said. “For some people, writing comes a lot easier. It’s definitely not the only way to express how you’re feeling about the situation, but I think it’s nice to have…. It’s going to represent a multitude, not the multitude, but a multitude of voices so people can feel like they’re having a part in expressing something. I think that’s helpful for people to take all of these internal thoughts and cast them out.” Siaw said that she hopes this time for reflection will spark further conversation. “It was a moment for people to just listen, which I think was important, and hopefully the conversation doesn’t end there,” she said. Several attendees expressed their emotions regarding the grand jury’s decision. “When I first heard, or read, [I] just felt a lot of anger,” Talia Baurer ’15 said. “Not really surprised, just anger. It kind of took a while to come down from that, especially knowing that this is not really my lived experience, this isn’t my reality, and understanding I can be angry, how people are actually feeling who actually live this is totally beyond what I can even begin to testify to understand.” Baurer added that she appreciated having this space to express grief and solidarity. “The system has failed everyone and this is just a space to understand that and be able to mourn,” she said. Taina Quiñones ’17 also conveyed her frustration toward the situation. “I definitely wanted to get involved because I am Puerto Rican, and I’m from the Bronx, and I know a lot of people who have to deal with [and] struggle with police brutality,” Quiñones said. “I’m already really passionate about it and then just hearing the news last night, I was just completely heartbroken. I felt a complete loss of faith in humanity and our country…. I’m feeling a little bit better with all the people who came out today, who are holding signs. I think this is a really powerful thing and definitely necessary. This is an issue that concerns everyone, not just black people, not just people of color.” Zhang recalled that as she awaited the decision, she felt that she could already tell what the verdict was going to be. Still, she was surprised Wilson was not, at the very least, indicted for negligence. “The moment [Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch] started speaking, I knew that from his tone and the way he was talking about the incident he would not be indicted because he never once reprimanded the officer,” Zhang said. “It was never even like, ‘The police force messed up, we’re going to now dig deep and try to fix those problems.’ It was like, ‘Oh, he acted on an instinct, and he’s going to walk free because of that.’ There was no recognition that the system failed.” Caines said that, based on history, he was pretty sure that Wilson would not face charges. Still, he noted that the decision was a blow nonetheless. “I think that growing up as a black American, you kind of have an idea that your life is a little bit de-valued, but when instances like this slap you in the face, and you’re not able to separate yourself from this and live in ignorance, when it comes right at you, it’s too much [to] be ignored,” Caines said. “I’m not saying it’s not always on our radar; it’s just when certain instances like this come up, there’s a raw emotion that you feel a draw to do something. Hopefully this is that something, or at least a start to that something.” Quiñones further spoke to the importance of taking action. “I think with stuff like this you can’t keep quiet, you can’t do it on an individual basis,” Quiñones said. “You have to make a statement, and I don’t think there’s any better place to do it than in the one place where every student comes throughout the day. I think this is the most powerful way we could go about getting our voices heard because a lot of people have the privilege to just go on with their lives without having to face that this is an issue. By putting it in the way of people’s lives, we’re making them realize what’s going on.” University President Michael Roth asserted that he was grateful to see students responding and expressing their feelings. “Regardless of what one thinks about the decision of the Grand Jury, there are enormous issues of injustice around the incarceration of African Americans and the police tactics used for people of color in this country,” Roth said. “When I saw students lined up outside with their hands up, my first impulse was to join them, which I did. But afterwards someone said, ‘I didn’t want to be there with you,’ because I’m an authority person on campus…. I realize that when I say something I’m not just speaking as Mike Roth, Class of ’78. On the other hand, I do think we have an obligation to investigate what many people here would call structural racism and patterns of injustice.” The discussion on Friday, Dec. 5 will focus more directly on a response to the decision in Ferguson. “We will be talking about the historical elements of this case,” Siaw said. “How do we move on from here? What do we do next? What can we do?” Caines added that next Friday’s discussion, like Tuesday’s grieving space, will invite a variety of perspectives to the table. “I think that, generally speaking, most people have similar goals in mind of equality and just very different ways to get there,” Caines said. “Having open dialogues and talking about feelings and experiences are really valuable ways to get there. I’m not going to say there’s one fix-all remedy because there’s not. When you have a system of oppression that’s been in place since the start of time, you’re not going to change everything overnight.”   Additional reporting contributed by Gabe Rosenberg ."
"A Belated Holiday Gift to Alma Mater: A Set of New Year’s Resolutions","2015-01-25","by Jason Shatz, Class of 2014","The year is young, and the semester brand new. From my armchair, I would like to propose a list of resolutions for the Wesleyan community. This is not meant to be exhaustive – I would be disappointed if additions were not presented. But here are five to start. 1. Commit to re-establishing trust on campus. The defining characteristic of 2014, both at Wesleyan and beyond, was turbulence. At Wesleyan, I observed a sad irony: the student body contains thoughtful young men and women who are eager expand their social and intellectual horizons – and yet it dangerously divided. Furthermore, students operate in a troubling zeitgeist, one filled with distrust. For example, many students do not trust the administration or Public Safety. The first thing that members of the Wesleyan community must do, therefore, is to commit to a new era where trust, transparency, and integrity are the norm. It needs to revitalize the Honor Code and the Code of Non-Academic Conduct. As a whole, this code needs to be revisited, updated, and put at the forefront of student life. 2. Improve campus safety The new Public Safety chief has been dealt a tough hand. A skeptical student body, a history of inappropriate officer behavior, a disturbing uptick in sexual violence – and that is just the tip of the iceberg. The department has started to enact overdue reforms to Wesleyan’s nightlife, including the enforcement of fire codes at concerts and in wood-frame houses. In order for the social scene to re-emerge, students must work with Public Safety and the administration to address the problems in campus safety. Most pressingly, the community must address the dangers that women face on campus – I want to add my appreciation for the hard work that students have done to illuminate them. Members of the community may disagree on the means, but they must share both the goal of improving campus safety for all – and mutual commitment of good faith toward that end. 3. Continue to fix Wesleyan’s fiscal woes. Since the Great Recession, Wesleyan has struggled to keep its endowment in decent shape, and the financial aid model had to be changed. Returning to the beloved model – 100% need blind for domestic applicants – would be nice, but Wesleyan should not do so if it is financially unsustainable. It needs to find a balance that provides the most possible assistance to needy students while not squeezing out the middle class. 4. Enrich the academic experience Wesleyan may be praised for its academics and the sheer breadth of intellectual thought that emanates from the community. But it does not adequately emphasize that set of core values that students deem essential – creativity, depth and breadth of critical thought, civic engagement, social justice. Some of these values are innate to the open curriculum, but others are not as prominent. I suggest codifying those values through new academic traditions. Firstly, core requirements rather than just general education expectations (or, for that matter, expectations that orientation spiels will stick for all four years). For example, consider a “diversity” requirement that asks students to take classes about different cultures. Whether through foreign-language classes or history classes – or many other types – there will be many ways to satisfy it. Secondly, expanding the “living and learning” program for freshmen (eventually for all freshmen, as Skidmore does). More educators would teach interdisciplinary courses with emphases on the aforementioned values, and students will live with peers who share at least one common interest – easing the transition to college and better facilitating the formation of lifelong friendships. Wesleyan also needs to better prepare students for the workplace. From revitalizing the Career Center to adding workshops for new apps and other important tools, Wesleyan needs to increase – in frequency and in quality – the scope of its efforts. In addition, Wesleyan should ensure that all students have ways to earn academic credit for internships. Employers would obviously love to have student interns, especially if they can compensate with academic credit instead of pay. Students, in turn, can remove a year from the four-year experience and save a year’s worth of money. 5. Revitalize Wesleyan’s social life. Only after Wesleyan ensures campus safety can Wesleyan’s social scene be truly revived. And it must re-emerge as son as possible, for a healthy social scene is crucial for the growth of all students. The shuttering of two fraternity houses, while justified, deprives Wesleyan of two large social spaces at a turbulent time. We need more spaces like those, especially in turbulent times like these. The only spaces that could possibly fit the student body are Foss Hill and the hockey rink. Working with Public Safety, students need to take advantage of existing facilities and create new, regulated environments for gatherings. Hopefully, more traditions will arise and unite the body of students now and to come."
"Students and Faculty Discuss Unpaid Internships at First Allbritton Talk","2015-02-02","by Tess Morgan, News Editor","Civic Engagement Fellow Rosy Capron organized a series of discussions about public life, the first of which focused on unpaid internships.c/o Rosy Capron On Friday, Jan. 30, students and faculty gathered in the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life for the first in a series of discussions sponsored by the Center. Simply named “Allbritton Talks,” the series was created by Rosy Capron ’14, the University’s 2014-2015 Civic Engagement Fellow, and seeks to bring community members together for meaningful conversations about public life. The first talk focused on the rise and morality of unpaid internships. Capron explained the motivation that spurred the series’ creation. “Part of the inspiration was thinking about ‘What is public life?’” Capron said. “We have the Allbritton Center, which has classes and hosts speakers, but we haven’t had much of an opportunity to bring students into the fold, to ask them, ‘What does it mean to examine our public life? What does it mean to have a public life?’” One important aspect of the series is that it draws students and faculty from all walks of life to discuss common issues. Capron stated that in the discussions she hopes to recreate and build on the conversations students have with their friends. “I [created the series] thinking about really great conversations that I have with students and that I had when I was a student about political topics and current events,” Capron said. “It’s important to also have those conversations outside of your friend group with people who are less likely to agree with everything you say, to be confronted with difference and to grapple with these issues.” The topic of the first discussion, unpaid internships, was selected as a non-controversial way to begin the series, according to Capron. One attendee, Alicia Gansley ’15, expressed her satisfaction with the outcome of the discussion. “I thought it was a great chance to meet with staff members and students to talk about a really hot button issue for Wesleyan students and students across the country,” Gansley said. “Everyone was respectful and engaged, and I enjoyed it.” Despite never having had an unpaid internship, Gansley said that she still felt included in the discussion. “I feel like the topic [still applied to me], because as we talked about, for some people, including me, unpaid internships aren’t a reality or a choice that we have, so I’m [glad] I got to have a voice in the conversation, saying, ‘It’s just not the same for everyone,’” Gansley said. “I’m doing the Civic Engagement certificate so this is sort of right up my ally. I think it’s a great way to institutionalize the conversations we have in our dorms and around school.” Joli Holmes ’17, another attendee, stated that she enjoyed having a conversation about public life with like-minded students. “I enjoyed the experience because you don’t get to have these types of conversations in class,” Holmes said. “It’s an out-of-class experience where you’re still learning and discussing important and meaningful topics. I think a lot of students could benefit from this type of conversation.” Holmes described her experience at the first talk and her willingness to continue to engage in these types of conversations. “I would absolutely come to another talk,” Holmes said. “I think it depends on the subject matter, of course, but if they are structured like this I would come. It was a good size, too. It would be good to include more people, but at the same time it would be harder to have this type of conversation with a larger group.” Capron echoed these sentiments, stating her excitement for future discussions, which might be about more controversial topics. “I was happy to have students as well as staff and administrators there,” Capron said. “I’m curious to see how it will be with different sized groups and other topics. We started with [the topic of] unpaid internships because it’s of relevance to students but it isn’t necessarily divisive and intense and everyone can speak from their own experiences, but it will be interesting to hear the conversations [that arise] from more controversial topics. We definitely want [topics] that people will get excited about and be passionate about; we just don’t want to be exclusive. We’re going to be branching out and we would love to get people riled up as long as it’s a good atmosphere and it doesn’t get personal. Getting heated isn’t a bad thing.” The calendar for the talks is still undecided; however, Capron hopes they will become a weekly event. “The goal was to have these conversations weekly, and if students want to keep having them, we will,” Capron said. “It doesn’t take a lot of time or money to have people sit in a room and chat. We want to be flexible and respond to current events that come up. I hope people submit topics that are of interest to them so that we can [incorporate them] into our conversations.”"
"Arcadia Magazine Spreads Political Awareness","2015-02-09","by Molly Schiff, Assistant News Editor","Arcadia: Wesleyan’s Political Magazine hopes to create multi-partisan unity.Lex Spirtes, Photo Editor Approximately 15 students gathered in Allbritton 103 on the evening of Sunday, Feb. 8 to learn more about a new campus publication. “Arcadia: Wesleyan’s Political Magazine,” a student-run publication, aims to be the University’s first multi-partisan political magazine, representing five core values: political engagement, discourse, accessibility, freedom of conscience, and pluralism. Hannah Skopicki ’18 conducted the meeting and will serve as the magazine’s editor-in-chief along with Matt Wallock ’18. Although the magazine is just getting started, its website (arcadiamagazine.weebly.com) describes its mission and includes information on how to submit content. The brainchild of members of the Wesleyan Democrats and the Wesleyan Republican Committee, the magazine was proposed at the end of the Fall 2014 semester. The editorial staff will consist of students who associate with both parties. Skopicki will represent the Wesleyan Republican Committee, and Wallock the Wesleyan Democrats. Additionally, Executive Editors Joseph Nucci ’16 and Ali Mann ’17 will focus on writers and content leaning toward the Republican and Democratic ideologies, respectively. Six staff writers of varying political affiliations have also joined the team. Because the magazine is multi-partisan, this variety will ensure inclusion, according to the organizers. It was stressed throughout the meeting that submissions representing all views, not just those of the two main parties, are welcomed and encouraged. “We really want to provide a platform for people of all different political ideologies along the political spectrum to present their viewpoints in a way in which they are guaranteed to be free of judgment and people harassing them based on what they think,” Skopicki said. “We want to expose people on campus to all different ideas that they may not have been exposed to before. We want to talk about things that people may not have even thought of before.” Production Manager Jack Guenther ’18 echoed these sentiments. “What excites me most is that there is such a broad base of political interest and experience here,” he said. “I mean, casting aside whatever true or untrue mythologies there might be about Wesleyan’s political attitudes, there are 3,000 people here, and each of them engages with politics in a different way. Ideally, we’d be able to tap into all 3,000 of those resources.” Another key point emphasized at the meeting was the broad demographic which the magazine hopes to target. The founders intend for the magazine to reach a wider audience than just those studying the social sciences or those harboring a fascination with politics. Rather, the goal of the magazine is to integrate relevant information into an informative, entertaining, and readable publication. Marshal Lawler ’16, President of the Wesleyan Democrats, attended the meeting and is excited about putting the magazine’s plans into action. “I feel like [genuine interest] is sort of lacking, especially when it comes to partisan elections, especially about local politics,” Lawler said. “ I think that this will be a good way for people to engage more thoroughly with politics in general and change the way people have those conversations.” Although it is not yet an officially recognized student group, Arcadia has received funding from the two campus political organizations. Emma Bentley ’17 will serve as the magazine’s business manager, working to create connections so that future editions will be published independently. Following a thorough explanation of Arcadia’s aims and operations, Skopicki opened the floor for questions. Spencer Brown ’18 inquired as to whether the publication’s debate section, where two students with different political affiliations engage in a written correspondence over a particular issue, will allow one with an affiliation other than Democrat or Republican to participate. Skopicki responded that while for the inaugural issue they will be sticking with the two major parties, future debates are certainly open to those will all associations. The publication is set to be distributed in early May. Currently, the goal is to publish one edition per semester, estimated at 40 pages. However, as the magazine gains momentum, the editors hope to publish on a quarterly basis. The editors are looking for ways to publish outside of their print issues. They intend to maintain a social media presence, run by the magazine’s Outreach and Media Director Victoria Hammitt ’17. Guenther is pleased with the evolutionary nature of the magazine.  “Just ten minutes ago, we were sparked by an idea that could be one of the better things we do all semester,” he said. In the coming weeks, the editors are hoping for these ideas to come to fruition. Anyone interested in writing both short- and long-form articles as well as multimedia projects is welcome to join the magazine as a contributor by contacting anyone on the editorial board or emailing arcadiapoliticalmagazine@gmail.com.

"Carnegie Foundation Awards University 2015 Community Engagement Classification","2015-02-19","by Kathy Yun, Staff Writer","c/o wesleyan.edu The Carnegie Foundation recently selected the University for its 2015 Community Engagement Classification. The award is for institutions that have demonstrated community engagement and founded on evidence-based documentation. The University was also selected for this recognition in 2008. According to the New England Resource Center for Higher Education, the Carnegie Community Engagement Classification considers community engagement a collaboration between institutions of higher education and their larger communities for the mutually beneficial exchange of knowledge and resources in a context of partnership and reciprocity. “We did our initial application in 2008, and it’s an extensive process where they ask numbers such as how many learning classes we have, how many professors are engaged, how many students take these classes, specific examples of partnerships and how they have developed, outcomes, and how the community is involved in all of this,” said Director of Center for Community Partnerships Cathy Lechowicz. “This time around, they ask you what has changed since last time, and how you have further engaged with the community.” The projects and activities considered in this Classification involve not just the participation of students, administrators, and professors, but also the community members. According to Lechowicz, the community is Middletown-centric, but can also range from Connecticut to even larger areas. “The whole idea is that the engagement isn’t just about the University, but that it’s about working in the world and how to engage the world in the work that you’re doing,” Lechowicz said. “It’s a partnership where you work with agencies and individuals to try to address some public need or some public project.” The University has accomplished major achievements since its classification in 2010. These include institutional advances such as the establishment of the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, which both did not exist five years ago. Specific projects include the establishment of the Center for Prison Education and the growth of WesReads and WesMath—both of which started out with half a dozen students and currently have more than 70 students who go to the Macdonough School in Middletown on a regular basis. Director of Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship Makaela Kingsley shared her views on the importance of community engagement. “At the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, we believe that community engagement and collaboration are paramount to all social impact work,” Kingsley said. “In fact, innovation or ‘charity’ alone—without cultural competence and involvement by relevant communities—can be destructive. Wesleyan students are better entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs because our students and faculty are highly engaged citizens.” Lechowicz added that the challenge of the institution is helping students to develop these projects and provide them that autonomy that many of the students want, while also providing institutional support for them in a way they can further their project. Another example of the University’s community engagement is the Green Street Teaching and Learning Center, a community-based studio that engages different members of the Middletown community such as students and faculty, local artists, and faculty from Middletown Community College. Most of the classes offered a combination of math and science with art and are taught to students of grades 1-8. Director of the Service-Learning Center Barbara Juhasz commented on the role of this organization. “Green Street is a wonderful example of community partnership that functions in so many different ways that involves students on a regular basis, involves faculty in service-learning courses, and provides a great mechanism for students to be more involved in the community,” Juhasz said. Anna Flurry ’17, student coordinator for Green Street Teaching and Learning Center, commented on what the organization has to offer in terms of community engagement. “Green Street offers this great opportunity for Wesleyan students to get out of the college bubble and interact with the Middletown community in a positive way,” Flurry said. “I think it’s really important to be aware that we’re part of a much bigger community called Middletown. We’ve been able to create many connections with the town around us, which has enabled us to get rid of the idea of otherness. I personally feel like I have a much stronger connection to Middletown.” Through this partnership, the Carnegie Foundation provides classified institutions with feedback on general themes throughout the application process such as insight in areas they can focus on and develop. Lechowicz praised the helpfulness of this process. “We talk with other schools and work with other people, but you certainly have your blinders on in a sense, Lechowics said. “It’s nice to get feedback from outside folks and the framework for engagement they provide.” The next opportunity to apply for Classification will be 10 years from now. This is an extension of the prior five years due to existing partnership, which shows the plan for the long-term relationship the Foundation and the University will have. For information on how to get involved, engagement work on campus, and community events, students can sign up for the ENGAGED newsletter or the Civic Engagement Fellow newsletter."
"WesBurlesque Arouses Student Conversation","2015-02-23","by Isabelle King, Staff Writer","Lex Spirtes, Photo Editor WesBurlesque will ring in its 12th anniversary this year with a performance that combines comedy, music, and dance. Since WesBurlesque’s conception in 2003, students have flocked to the WestCo Café to become temporarily absorbed in a performance platform that addresses the human body, sexuality, and notions of desire. Under the direction of Taylor Dauphin ’15, Lucas McLaughlin ’15, and Liza Sankar-Gorton ’15, this year’s show will focus predominantly on self-love and confidence. “That is the goal of Burlesque,” Sankar-Gorton wrote in an email to The Argus. “So when we perform we’re all somewhere on the path toward that goal.” On this quest for self-actualization, Burlesque encourages its performers to form a more intimate relationship with their insecurities, or buried aspects of themselves that have potentially served as a source of bodily discomfort, something many of the dancers have faced. Sankar-Gorton believes that this specific quality of the show is a vital aspect of unity among cast members. “You’re telling your [cast mates] your embarrassing moments; sharing the things that make you feel guilty, ashamed, and disgusted; revealing your insecurities; and, literally, showing them your nearly naked body,” Sankar-Gorton wrote. “The most gratifying part is feeling vulnerable and supported simultaneously.” For the Burlesque performers, the opportunity to tackle their insecurities in a setting void of judgment is instrumental in discovering extensions of themselves of which they might not previously have been aware. “My routine for a long time consisted of playing basketball and doing physics,” performer Ziggy Zacks ’15 wrote in a message to The Argus. “Burlesque has made me embrace a side of myself that I barely knew existed. It has allowed me to be myself on the most primal of levels, and address issues I only vaguely knew that I had.” In an effort to discourage escapism and promote natural confidence, the directors mandate a sober performance from the cast members. The cast members agree that this has helped them become more in tune with their bodies. “[B]urlesque is all about being comfortable in your raw form,” Zacks wrote. “Not after 1, 2, or 7 drinks, but when you are truly yourself. Confidence isn’t utilizing ‘liquid courage,’ it is about being comfortable with oneself. Why need help? You are awesome and you gotta believe it.” Whether performers use WesBurlesque as a means of branching out socially, becoming more confident in their own skin, or embracing suppressed quirks, this show promotes an acceptance of self through an initial engagement with the unfamiliar. “WesBurlesque has instilled in me an appreciation for my body and all I can do with it,” Sarah Seo ’16 wrote in an email to The Argus. Seo commenced her WesBurlesque career during the spring of her freshman year, and will celebrate her third year of performance and first year as a choreographer during this year’s show. “Beyond a show, Burlesque is a community—one that promotes enough bravery in me to want to go out on stage and perform,” Seo wrote. Seo said that her participation in the show has helped to improve her relationship with her body. “Never in a million years did I think that I would reach the apex of my confidence in just a bra and underwear,” Seo wrote. This year’s audition invitations on Facebook communicated that everyone, regardless of hir role in the show, should have positive takeaways. The invitation suggests that attaining a sense of personal agency can extend beyond the reaches of the stage. “It’s an experience that can be therapeutic, eye-opening, terrifying, transformative, and of course, exciting—for us and for our audience,” the invitation reads. “We recognize the need to strike a balance between making Burlesque be for us, the cast, and making Burlesque be for the community—we strive to have everyone take away something positive from this show.” Sonia Lombroso ’16 expects to attend the show for her third consecutive year. Despite her role as a spectator, she finds the performance empowering. “The first time I went to see the show my freshman year, I left feeling invigorated, impressed, and powerful,” Lombroso said. “These feelings increase every time I see the show. To watch my friends and fellow classmates take control of their bodies, strengths, and flaws is truly awe-inspiring.” Despite these glowing reviews, the show has in past years been subject to criticism regarding the demographic of the audience to which it tailors its message. Trouve Ivo ’16 wrote a Wespeak in The Argus last year that addressed a perceived lack of attention paid to the different facets that comprise sexuality, particularly those related to gender and sexual orientation. “Even though it made me happy to see so many of my friends performing and getting hoot-and-hollered at, I am sad about the potentiality foreclosed by WesBurlesque,” Ivo wrote. “One can situate this event within a more common student hypocrisy at Wesleyan: a noncommittal critical engagement, which claims a progressive stance but inevitably avoids confronting racial, sexual, gender, and class tensions.” Ivo wrote the article in response to his own experience with WesBurlesque. “I wrote the article because I felt very implicated during WesBurlesque,” Ivo said, “Partly because of everything that I felt was erased. If you go to a show and it’s not representing your desires or sparking something deep within you, then it’s not going to connect.” This year, Ivo is collaborating with a number of students on campus to found ESQUE, an event that will be held the weekend before WesBurlesque and examine non-normative sexuality and marginalized voices through performance. “Instead of augmenting the preexisting Burlesque on campus, we’re trying to create something that’s totally different,” Ivo said. Ivo was quick to convey that he appreciates all that WesBurlesque does for the students, and that ESQUE was created as a secondary avenue of exploration that has more of a political agenda. The hope is that ESQUE and WesBurlesque can work in tandem to have all people on this campus, no matter their race, gender, or sexual orientation, feel represented. “I really don’t think that ESQUE is more important than WesBurlesque or [vice] versa,” Ivo said. “They’re both accomplishing very distinct things.” In the face of this, WesBurlesque has opened up a dialogue with the larger Wesleyan community. Conversations, open forums, and Q&A sessions were held in the days prior to auditions and will continue through opening night to ensure not only that the ethos of the performance is clear, but also that individual opinions are considered when organizing the show’s trajectory. “Regardless of whether it is ESQUE or WesBurlesque, both shows should ask the audience to consider their own definition of sexy,” Ivo said. “That will obviously be influenced by mainstream ideals of beauty. But it’s an important question to ask. These shows should communicate that individuals should be true to themselves no matter what they are doing.”"
"Foss Hill Day Fosters Nostalgia to Fund Financial Aid","2015-04-02","by Tom Fischer, Staff Writer","Thursday, April 2 has been announced the annual day of recognition and fundraising in honor of Foss Hill.Noah Mertz, Staff Photographer Last week, the Office of University Relations announced the establishment of an annual day of recognition and fundraising in honor of Foss Hill. Thursday, April 2 marked the inaugural day. and sudents, professors, and alumni were invited to share their experiences and memories of this central landmark on the University campus. Charles Fedolfi ’90, Director of Annual Giving, is one of the main organizers of Foss Hill Day, along with William Holder ’75, Director of University Communications. As a graduate of the University, Fedolfi has many fond memories of the hill and thinks of it as a poignant symbol of the University. “As a student I spent many days hanging out on Foss Hill listening to music and just hanging out,” Fedolfi wrote in an email to The Argus. “I also remember watching my sister graduate from Foss Hill because it afforded a better view than the seats. Since I started in University Relations a couple of years ago, I’ve reflected on my own reengagement with Wesleyan. We were looking for a way to get the attention of our busy alumni to help remind them of their time here, something that is unique to us, something that only has meaning to the relative few of us in the world. Foss Hill was it.” Barbara-Jan Wilson, Vice President for University Relations, affirmed Fedolfi’s sentiments about Foss Hill, sharing some of her own memories. “I have had the privilege to work at Wesleyan for almost 33 years,” Wilson wrote in an email to The Argus. “Foss Hill is central to those memories: watching the men’s baseball team play and go to the College World Series, tailgating for some great Little Football victories, sledding and skiing with my kids on snow days (I lived on Mount Vernon Street for 9 years) and greeting alumni as they return for Reunion/Commencement weekends.” The universal appreciation for Foss Hill among members of the Wesleyan community is what made it the subject of the new campaign, according to Fedolfi. “Wesleyan students have many varied and rich experiences on campus, but everyone shares the experience of enjoying Foss Hill,” Fedolfi wrote. “The view, the sledding, the sunshine on a warm day—these are moments students carry into their lives after Wesleyan. Foss Hill Day is meant to help all members of the Wesleyan community feel connected, wherever they are.” According to statistics provided by President Michael Roth at the March 1 WSA meeting, the University had only raised 85 percent of the funds it had intended with the end of the “THIS IS WHY” campaign approaching. Moreover, the University is currently paying off a $200 million debt that was taken out on an unspecified date in the past. While the University pays $10 million every year, rates are set to increase by 2023, providing a strong impetus for the University to not only restructure the debt, but also pursue more proactive fundraising. Wilson clarified hat the fundraising aspect of Foss Hill Day was purely to help bolster financial aid resources. “All the money we raise on April 2 will help Wesleyan students,” Wilson wrote. “Financial aid is the single most important priority in our $400 million…campaign. Every gift helps.” This is where the metaphor of Foss Hill meets the goals of the administration, Fedolfi said, citing the ubiquity among Wesleyan students and alumni as a lynchpin that would, hopefully, remind alumni of the importance of financial aid to many students. “Foss Hill Day is meant to remind us of our common ground and, particularly for alumni, our common purpose of supporting Wesleyan students,” Fedolfi wrote. “Both my sister and I received financial aid, and helping students afford Wesleyan is very important to me and all of us at Wesleyan. So, we are asking people to support students on Foss Hill Day and that includes a challenge gift from Tom Kelly ’73…. We’re hoping…we’ll attract 1,000 donors as a follow-up to our Giving Tuesday effort (Dec. 2, 2014) of more than 2,300 donors in one day. On Giving Tuesday we raised more than $500,000 for the Wesleyan Fund.” However, while Foss Hill Day is primarily a fundraising event, Fedolfi hopes that it will go beyond one-time donations and bring all members of the Wesleyan community together, much as the hill itself is a unifying landmark. “But beyond financial support, a healthy and engage[d] alumni network is important to students,” Fedolfi wrote. “Alumni provide students with advice and opportunities, and the more of them who feel connected, the more they can help. We plan to make Foss Hill Day a recurring event, though not necessarily always on April 2.” While Fedolfi, Wilson, and the administration at large are excited about the day of appreciation, student reaction was mixed. Foss Hill, it seems, may not be so ubiquitous. To some, the day seemed pointless. “Why?” asked Emery Frick ’17. “I mean, [Foss Hill] sure is there. Students won’t donate any money, and parents will just say ‘who cares?’ Alumni might, I guess. Not that many people hang out on Foss; it’s just like the same people repeatedly. I don’t know. Good try, Wesleyan.” Others, however, agreed with Fedolfi’s sentiments on the hill. “Foss Hill is an icon,” Michael Sheldon ’17 said. “It is a symbol of school-wide unity.”"
"Brown Discusses Design Thinking","2015-04-06","by Kathy Yun, Staff Writer","On Thursday, April 2, Dontrese Brown gave a talk on design thinking and innovation.J. Dontrese Brown, a motivational creative design professional and a former creative director, spoke last Thursday April 2 in the Public Affairs Center about the power of design thinking in building a more innovative world. The talk was titled, “We Are Not Who You Think We Are: Storytellers, Creative Problem Solvers and Drivers of Innovation Through the Power of Design.” Kai Entrepreneurship Wesleyan (Kai Wes) and the “Innovation Through Design Thinking” student forum collaboratively hosted the talk, which was co-sponsored by the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. Brown formerly served as a creative director at Victorinox Swiss Army, where he played a key role in guiding the creative development process for the company. He was also the director of membership and engagement for the American Institute of Graphic Arts (AIGA) in Connecticut. He studied and then taught graphic design at Georgetown College in Kentucky, where he was the first student to graduate with a BFA in graphic design. Brown started his talk by stating the importance of the difference between a design doer and a design thinker. He left Swiss Army because it required him to be a “design doer,” rather than the design thinker he wanted to be. After his departure, he began consulting for a living, which allowed him to help others revolutionize their ways of thinking. “We are not who you think we are; we are storytellers, problem solvers and drivers of innovation through the power of design,” Brown said. “That is what we do. Now we are talking design thinking. We were so used to being those problem solvers and storytellers to a certain point. Give me a problem, I’ll solve it and then it’s done; now the challenge is thinking beyond that and pushing the envelope a whole lot. Because that’s the way society is going and that’s the way innovation is taking us.” Brown centered his talk around three questions: What is design thinking? How do we use design thinking? And where is it going? Brown defined design thinking as having a sense of purpose that helps society. “Design doing is basically being told what to do, sitting in your studio and thinking linear,” Brown said. “One idea to the next idea to the next idea…. Design thinking is being a hub. Imagine spokes on a wheel, and that you’re that hub, and all those spokes are your ideas. We’re no longer thinking in that linear line that limits us to our solutions. Now we’re thinking of all these other avenues, all these other things based around the project or the problem that we need to solve.” Brown explained that design thinking consists of four key elements, the first of which is to “define the ‘right’ problem.” This step involves locating the question that needs to be answered. The second element, “create and consider many options,” suggests the method of five versus one, which encourages looking at a problem from five different perspectives as opposed to one for more profound results. Then comes “refine selected directions,” which suggests asking questions until one gets to the core of the issue, and then creating solutions around it. The last element, “pick the winner, execute,” is about testing the prototypes that have been created. Brown concluded the talk with a quote by Henry Ford: “If we had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” “[Henry Ford] pushed the thought process,” Brown said. “He was already design thinking. He wasn’t thinking about what’s happening right now; he was thinking about what is going to happen years down the road. We’re not going to be on horses in 5, 10, 15 years. That’s what you have to think. Surround yourselves with people who think differently than you, take chances and be aware of your mistakes, and follow the process. But most importantly, find out what the real problem is. ‘How many designers does it take to change a light bulb?’ You have to think, ‘Why the light bulb?’” Mika Reyes ’17, co-president of Kai Wes and one of the leaders of the student forum ‘Innovation Through Design Thinking,’ explained how the talk fulfills both groups’ mission of promoting diversity in entrepreneurship pursuits on campus. “First of all, we wanted more people of color on board in our initiatives of Kai Wes,” Reyes said. “Second, the nature of the class or the session is open to all different personas…. Design thinking is something that can be applied to lots of different ways of thinking. Third, design thinking [and] professional graphic designers…are not as frequent on campus, so we’re hoping to contribute to this community a bit more.” Mia Deng ’17, another leader of the forum, discussed the importance of design thinking to a liberal arts education. “I think design thinking is the new liberal arts,” Deng said. “It is a package of all the soft skills that Wesleyan is nurturing: communication, teamwork, embracing failures, and working with creativity, which in general is interdisciplinary thinking. It’s also a good channel for us to start with one problem and tap into all of these skills and practice with them. The fact that we as students are already able to design and implement, potentially see tangible results, and see the impact that we can have on our community itself is really valuable.”"
"Student Groups Clash Over Politics of Israel and Palestine","2015-04-13","by Matthew Wallock, Jenny Davis, Features Editor and Contributing Writer","c/o electronicintifada.net Over the past few weeks, The Argus spoke to leaders and members of four activist groups that confront the Israel-Palestine conflict: Wesleyan United with Israel, J Street U, Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), and Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP). In doing so, we sought to understand the state of Israel-Palestine activism on campus, the tension that has surfaced in its past, the issues with which it deals in the present, and the conversations it hopes to continue in the future. Meet the key players here. The Shifting Landscape Last year, when Rebecca Sussman ’18 visited campus during WesFest, she struck up a conversation with a student about the conflict in the Middle East. When Sussman used the word “Zionist,” the atmosphere became tense. “You can’t say that here,” Sussman remembers the student telling her. “It’s a dirty word.” Sussman hopes that this will soon no longer be the case. This fall, she, along with first-year students Rachel Alpert, Elisa Greenberg, and Matthew Renetzky, reinstated Wesleyan United with Israel, a pro-Israel group that supports a two-state solution and opposes the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. Tasked with building a new membership, they remain frustrated by perceptions about what it means to support Israel. Renetzky emphasized that Wesleyan United with Israel is more complicated than right-wing stereotypes often suggest. “I’m going to borrow a metaphor from Alan Elsner,” Renetzky said. “There’s a difference between being a fan and a cheerleader. As a cheerleader…you can be losing 50-3, and you’re still cheering the team on…. Or you can be a fan, who feels passionately about the team but who is still willing to criticize [them] and see them for what they are. We’re almost hyper-realistic. We’re acutely aware of every problematic thing, but that doesn’t mean we still can’t support this country.” Maya Berkman ’16, a current leader of J Street U at Wesleyan and northeast regional co-chair for J Street U, pointed out that the differences among the four groups on campus concerned with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are not always as great as they seem. “I think there’s a lot of overlap,” Berkman said. “The students who are engaged with this issue, or at least seriously engaged with this issue, [compose] a pretty small group of people, and you start to recognize the same faces at various events…. I think on such a small campus it’s problematic when we try to divide ourselves so definitely between the different groups.” According to Berkman, J Street U is relatively centrist, a position that appeals to her because of its capacity for nuance. J Street, the parent organization of the college chapters, is a pro-Israel group that supports a two-state solution. “I think having our political focus being the establishment of a two-state solution does put us kind of in the center in a way that’s unique, because we encompass students who fall to our right and our left,” she said. To J Street U’s left stands the newly established campus chapter of Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), which, among other things, calls for an end to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Yael Horowitz ’17, a founding member, noted that although JVP has a strong relationship with Studens for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and a neutral one with J Street U, tension exists between JVP and Wesleyan United with Israel. “That stems from deep ideological differences,” she said. “I think [Wesleyan United with Israel] also [has] problems with the way we operate. Making Jewish spaces political is a problem [for them], and I think us not turning away from politics and from the issue is the opposite of what they do in a lot of ways, because they’re trying to celebrate culture without turning towards politics. That’s an obvious point of tension.” Moreover, Horowitz added that although the conflict in the Middle East is far removed geographically, it is closer than many people would like to believe. “The occupation of Palestine is not happening at Wesleyan, but Wesleyan students are complicit in it, and are always in a lot of ways unaware of it,” she said. Many choose ignorance in pursuit of comfort, said Horowitz, but JVP aims to be a source of education and discomfort, especially within Jewish spaces. “I think success has to be measured in the amount of people that you reach and the amount of people who start actually thinking critically about it,” she said. Still to the left of JVP is SJP, whose members declined to be interviewed for this article. “We’ve decided we’re not going to do any direct interviews because our group has a lot of diverse opinions and we can’t reduce ourselves to one voice (even if that voice isn’t officially a spokesperson),” wrote SJP member Alice Markham-Cantor ’18 in an email to The Argus. According to the national SJP website, the organization supports the BDS movement and denounces the Israeli occupation.   Boycotts, Protests, Vandalism Last spring, the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) passed a resolution in favor of joining the BDS movement, which, according to its website, campaigns globally to withhold support from Israel until it complies with international law and Palestinian rights. Horowitz believes that the hearings began necessary conversations on campus and, ultimately, to the establishment of a University chapter of JVP. “It was pretty clear to me that there needed to be an organization that talked specifically about Jewish students’ relationship to this issue, because often times it’s harder for Jewish students to let go of things that they’ve been taught their whole life and realize the reality of the situation on the ground,” Horowitz said. Passing the resolution was an important symbolic stance, but Horowitz has been disappointed by the WSA’s lack of enforcement of the ban. “The passing of the resolution itself was pretty powerful, to say that the student body stands behind divestment,” she said. “The WSA is flawed as an organization because there’s no way to keep them accountable to the resolutions that they pass…and they know it. That’s been one of the challenges with divestment, is just getting people to follow through on things they commit to do.” Although Berkman agreed with Horowitz that the proposition produced necessary dialogue on campus, she remarked that the discussions revealed a problematic dynamic. “I think it was a big lesson to us at J Street and really eye-opening to understand the dynamics at that time,” she said. “It was also frustrating, because it was the end of the semester…and then it kind of dropped, and everyone leaves for break. I think you see that quite a bit on campus. These big issues rise up, there’s some sort of chaos around it, and the semester ends, and everyone goes home. Some people are left upset, while most people just forget.” In November 2014, International House, Turath House, and the Bayit hosted the International Conflict Panel Discussion Series, attempting to continue that dialogue, among others. The first event in the series sought to involve members of Wesleyan United with Israel, J Street U, and SJP. However, Renetzky, the representative for Wes with Israel, was disappointed to learn that SJP had declined to participate. “It was going to be awesome to show that these three groups can work together and talk about a really heated thing,” Renetzky said. In March, SJP members elaborated on their decision in a Wespeak titled, “Israel’s Apartheid State,” in which they wrote: “We believe that dialogue on this campus about Palestine/Israel should not be ‘normalizing’—meaning we should not accept Israeli state actions as ‘normal’ or appropriate.” Horowitz commented on this issue of normalization. “I think you can’t expect voices to be heard through dialogue, because that normalizes the occupation as a conflict as opposed to the occupation that is illegal of a land that doesn’t belong to Israel,” she said. “To expect to hear all of those voices when you sit down for dialogue isn’t going to happen.” Instead, Horowitz proposes that people seek out these marginalized voices. “People need to be educating themselves more to hear these voices, and going into spaces where they might be uncomfortable,” she said. That panel was only one of a few incidents that contributed to unease between members of Wesleyan United wih Israel and SJP. In February, Wesleyan United with Israel hosted a free Israeli Late Night. Days before the event, an SJP member posted an article about Israel’s appropriation of Palestinian and North African cuisine to the Facebook event page. “They also flyered outside our event saying, ‘The hummus is free, but Palestine isn’t,’” Sussman said. According to Renetzky, posters that Wesleyan United with Israel had hung in Usdan to advertise for the event were vandalized. He was discouraged by the animosity that these attacks revealed. “They crossed out ‘Israeli’ and wrote ‘Palestine,’” Renetzky said. “Then they crossed out ‘Israeli’ and wrote ‘Fascism.’” Sussman was also upset by the vandalism, which she believes limited the group’s ability to express its aims. “While we believe so vehemently that everyone should feel comfortable voicing their opinion…and I totally believe that SJP should exist…I just think it’s sad that they don’t seem to feel the same way, when I really consider that so important,” she said. Alpert believes that the vandalism incident is suggestive of more widespread animosity towards Wesleyan United with Israel. “The fact that we can’t hold an event celebrating the culture—just the culture; we were not defending any of Israel’s military actions—we think is problematic on this campus,” she said. Horowitz explained that protesters handed out flyers because of the difficulty of disentangling Israeli culture from politics. “You can’t separate Israeli culture from what’s happening there,” she said. “I think Wes with Israel is a political group, and to get people to come to celebrate the culture and not own up to the politics being espoused is not an honest way to talk about culture.”   The Wall as a Metaphor Israeli Apartheid Week is an annual, international series of events that, according to its website, aims to raise awareness of Israel’s apartheid policies toward Palestinians and to build support for the BDS movement. In early March, members of SJP collaborated on the aforementioned Wespeak, “Israel’s Apartheid State,” to explain its decision to erect a portable wall, which stood in various locations including Olin Library and Usdan. “In the words of Wesleyan United with Israel, ‘You are going to hear a lot in the coming weeks. You are going to hear that Israel is an apartheid state,’” the Wespeak reads. “This accusation is part of the message of Apartheid Week, a university-based movement that seeks to raise awareness about Israel’s apartheid policies towards the Palestinians.” SJP’s Wespeak referenced another Wespeak that the Wesleyan United with Israel founders had published two weeks prior, titled “Apartheid and Genocide in the Middle East,” in which they contested the usage of words such as “apartheid” and “genocide.” “We think those words misrepresent the situation,” Greenberg said. Renetzky was unsettled by the wall and the words spray-painted on it, which included “End Israeli apartheid” and “WALL WALL WALL.” “I’m really upset by it,” he said. “‘Genocide’ is such a loaded word. There’s been genocide in Uganda; there’s been the Armenian genocide; there’s been the Holocaust. To call what’s happening in Israel genocide is wrong. It delegitimizes and minimizes so many terrible things that have happened in the world and are happening in the world.” SJP’s Wespeak explains that its members chose to include the word “apartheid” intentionally. “The word ‘apartheid’ does carry a lot of weight,” the article reads. “In the case of Israel, it represents many of the realities for Palestinians living under illegal Israeli occupation, and although the situation in Israel/Palestine is not identical to that of South African Apartheid, this vocabulary provides us with a means of understanding the occupation and the wars on Gaza.” Renetzky, however, maintains that the portable wall does not tell the full story. “They put up this big concrete wall in Usdan, in Olin, wherever,” he said. “They’ll tell you, ‘It’s this long, it’s this big, these are the 10 reasons that it’s oppressive.’ What they’re not going to tell you is that 90 percent of that wall is chain-link fence. It’s not all huge concrete barriers with watch towers. And what they’re especially not going to tell you why that wall is in place. In some areas, there were people from within the West Bank, snipers, who were shooting at Israeli citizens. So in response to these snipers, Israel built up a security, protection wall. So, wall goes down, who’s to say snipers don’t come back?” Renetzky believes that not telling the full story allows SJP to more easily rally support more easily. “It’s so easy to be like, ‘Sign this petition!’” he said. “‘It’s for human rights.’ But…my mother’s Israeli…and I have a lot of family who lives there as well. I hear the narrative of, ‘This is my life, this is my country, there are missiles being fired at me all the time, and we need these things.’” According to Horowitz, however, the point of the wall is to generate horror and discomfort. “The wall is a really powerful educational tool because it shocks people and it makes people uncomfortable in a way that is going to make them search for more information,” she said. “It is nothing more than a fact that [the] wall exists, and the realities of that wall exist, and so it’s really hard for people to disagree with the wall. It’s a representation of something that is happening in our world.”   Future Visions, Conversations   Despite the tension that has surfaced, leaders of the groups who were interviewed are optimistic about the degree of engagement on campus. “I think that having [Wesleyan United with Israel] on campus enriches the dialogue even for people who don’t agree,” Greenberg said. “There are a lot of people who came up to us and said, ‘I’m part of J Street, and I don’t align with you politically, and I think this is great. And I think it’s great that you’re doing this.’” For Greenberg, continued engagement is a goal in and of itself. “I hope that people continue to engage with us, not necessarily that we change their political beliefs,” she said. “I engaged with a lot of different groups and formulated my beliefs, which was really cool. I think that going forward, we want people to know that we exist, that we are approachable, and we want dialogue. We want people who have pro-Israel beliefs to feel comfortable saying that, but we also want them to say, ‘But I don’t agree with this one thing [Israel] did.’” University President Michael Roth said that he appreciates the diversity of opinions on campus, advocating for a high level of discourse among students. “Oy vey!” Roth said. “I think that trying to understand the issues in that conflict, and how one might be able to have an impact on American policy or what goes on there, is a really good question to ask oneself. Raising the intellectual level of understanding about the issues of the occupation, of the dynamic of violence and war in the region, Israel’s security concerns, and human rights issues—there’s a whole range of things to think about, that people are politely and intellectually disagreeing about.” Roth aims to foster an atmosphere in which students can engage with this issue safely and deeply. “I see my role as president, as opposed to…just a citizen, is to help the dynamic of sometimes intense, sometimes conflictual conversation and debate, but also to make sure that people don’t feel threatened, that they have some protection if things get too intense, that they’re not going to be ostracized, and they’re certainly not physically at risk,” Roth said. “I’m proud of the community that people can debate vigorously, but stay in the world of discourse rather than violence.” University Jewish Chaplain Rabbi David Leipziger Teva noted that this issue is especially contentious because it affects many students personally and ethically. Like Roth, he advocates for inclusivity and open-mindedness. “We should all keep in mind that students who are active in the various Israel/Palestine groups on campus are often motivated by ethical values of justice and human rights as well as from personal identification with a geographical place that is close to their hearts and the hearts of their ancestors,” Teva said. “Our challenge is to create intellectually sophisticated conversations where students can be exposed to alternative political narratives without being labeled or disempowered.” There might be no conclusion or resolution, but Berkman is confident that students are capable of participating in increasingly constructive conversations."
"Scholars in Action Host Enrichment Days","2015-04-16","by Katya Dajani, Staff Writer","On April 22 and May 5, Scholars in Action, a student group that tutors students at local middle schools, will be hosting its first ever Wesleyan Enrichment Days.Scholars in Action, a student group that tutors students at local middle schools, will be hosting its first ever Wesleyan Enrichment Days. The Enrichment Days, on Wednesday, April 22 and Tuesday, May 5, will take place on Foss Hill and offer a number of workshops to students from schools such as Keigwin Middle School and Woodrow Wilson Middle School. Event organizers, Lily Wittrock ’16 and Rebecca Brand ’16, are currently looking for individuals and groups on campus who would be interested in leading workshops on a variety of different topics. “These Enrichment Days are something we have been planning on doing with our kids [since] this group’s inception,” Wittrock and Brand wrote in an email to The Argus. “We go to Keigwin and Woodrow Wilson every week during their after school program to help with homework, and their enrichment activities (yoga, cooking, video game design, swimming, poetry). We are inviting the students to [the University] as an extension of the work we do with them every week creating a fun, educational environment.” The two hope to help bridge the gap between the University and the Middletown community through Enrichment Day workshops. Potential topics include drawing, dance, science, and creative writing. In addition to these workshops, the days will include a campus tour and other activities. “We are planning on starting with a big icebreaker outside, then taking tours around campus with [University] students,” Wittrock and Brand wrote. “After that, we will break out into smaller groups to participate in activities led by…student groups.” According to the University’s ENGAGE blog, the workshops are expected to include 5 to 15 students for an engaging 40 minutes. “If you are interested in education or just feel like frolicking on Foss with some hilarious preteens, then this may be the low-commitment opportunity for you,” the blog reads. The organizers are hoping to work with different program houses, as well as student groups, to ensure that the days will allow the middle school students a glimpse of college life. In addition, the organizers wish to motivate students to attend colleges while also providing time for them to socialize with University students outside the classroom. Rosy Capron ’14, a Civic Engagement Fellow at the University’s Center for Community Partnerships, has assisted in getting the project underway. “Middle schoolers don’t know very much about what people study and do for fun in college, especially at a liberal arts college,” Capron said. “They take ‘Language Arts,’ ‘Social Studies,’ and ‘Science,’ not ‘Chinese Poetry,’ ‘Latin American History,’ or ‘Conservation Biology.’ The enrichment days are a great way for them to learn about the academic and extracurricular activities that make college worthwhile.” She added that this event is the first of its kind in recent years. “Students from the Middletown area come to campus for High School Humanities and programs in the Davison Arts Center, Van Vleck Observatory, and Mansfield Freeman Center, but I don’t believe we’ve tried anything very similar to the Enrichment Days in recent years,” Capron said. The feedback from the student body has so far been positive. Scholars in Action have been working alongside the Office of Community Service to ensure that the day is possible. “There are a lot of other groups that tutor in Middletown schools during the day but ours is the first specifically working with an established, structured after-school program for middle schoolers,” wrote Wittrock and Brand."
"Ditch the Dean’s List","2015-04-20","by Jenny Davis, Features Editor","I was walking through the Exley lobby when I overheard a tour guide telling his group that due to student petitions, the University no longer posts the names of the highest-performing scholars in the sciences. According to the tour guide, that decision exemplifies the Wesleyan mentality of collaboration, decreases the cutthroat competition found at other colleges and universities, and removes the emphasis from grades, placing it instead on learning. Why, then, do we still have the Dean’s List? Released last week, last semester’s list contains the names of the approximately 140 students, or about 18 percent, of each class who had earned a GPA of 93.35 or above as of last semester. The email sent to the students who made the Dean’s List read, “The Dean’s List honors [your] accomplishment, and recognizes your hard work, intellectual engagement, and love of learning.” It does? I’m pretty sure the Dean’s List simply recognizes a GPA of 93.35 or above. It certainly might recognize hard work, but it could just as easily measure taking easy classes and having the luxury of not holding on-campus jobs. It might recognize intellectual engagement, or it might be the product of memorizing facts and bullshitting essays. And love of learning? I’m not really sure what that even means. This is not to say that we should not have grades. Grades, too, can be criticized for reflecting not achievement but memorization and wealth, but that question is not the issue of this article. The issue of this article is the public recognition of students with a certain GPA. Let’s deal first with the students on the Dean’s List. Perhaps the assumption is that students who are recognized will be sufficiently motivated to keep achieving, but that is simply not the case. According to Alfie Kohn, author of “Punished by Rewards,” rewards and recognition are threats to continued motivation. “There are at least 70 studies showing that extrinsic motivators—including A’s, sometimes praise, and other rewards—are not merely ineffective over the long haul but counterproductive with respect to the things that concern us most: desire to learn, commitment to good values, and so on,” Kohn writes on his website, summarizing findings that he publishes in his book. In other words, the Dean’s List not only fails to motivate students to excel in the long term, but also fails to cultivate what it professes to produce (or continue): hard work, intellectual engagement, and love of learning. Students who are on the Dean’s List might in fact be there because they love learning, are intellectually engaged, and work tirelessly, but being recognized for these things might ironically make them less likely to occur in the future; students who are already intellectually engaged are likely to become less concerned with love of learning when the extrinsic motivator is introduced, and those who are not engaged are unlikely to become so. Some will of course argue that the Dean’s List is not simply about motivating students, but also recognizing the hard work and accomplishment of students with high GPAs. Don’t they deserve to be lauded publicly for what they have accomplished? That is a fair question, but I’m not quite sure why recognizing those students publicly is necessary. Why can’t it be enough that they know what they’ve achieved? Their professors know, their parents know, and their advisors know; does it have to be on the website? This is not a cry for humility or modesty, but one for privacy: The Dean’s List violates students’ right to keep their grades private. Moreover, there is no equivalent of the Dean’s List for arts, sports, or other extracurriculars. It’s fine to place the value on academic success—it’s a university—but publishing the names of students with high GPAs takes away from other students’ major creative accomplishments, such as writing and directing plays, designing clothes for fashion shows, and producing films. Perhaps an even larger problem is that the Dean’s List does not even recognize the highest academic achievers who do not receive grades, such as students in the College of Social Studies  and the College of Letters. Grades are important, if you want them to be. But reporting your GPA to your employer can stand on its own; although your being listed on the Dean’s List website might look impressive, it is unlikely to strongly influence  someone’s decision to hire you. Let’s deal now with those who are not on the Dean’s List. We’ve established that students who have been recognized are unlikely to reap enormous benefit from that recognition, but what about those who do not find themselves on the list? Are they likely to be suddenly motivated to succeed because of it? Maybe, but probably not: If a student is hell-bent on making the Dean’s List the following semester, ze is more likely to select easier classes—ones in which ze is relatively sure ze’ll get an A—rather than try to cultivate intellectual engagement or love of learning. And what about the effect on our community? The Dean’s List does not exactly produce cutthroat competition, and most people do not pay attention to it except for the week it comes out, but in that week—and possibly beyond—it merely breeds resentment and an uncomfortable feeling of competition. Why is this necessary? If it is helpful neither to the awardees nor to the non-awardees, and might in fact be detrimental to both parties, why have it at all? The potential harm is great; the potential benefit is slim. I’m far from the first person to feel this way. In March of 2011, Rachel Pincus ’13 wrote a Wespeak titled, “The Open Dean’s List: It Doesn’t Get Much More Un-Wesleyan Than This!” I agree with Pincus, who says, “It seems inimical to Wesleyan’s values of collaboration, community, and learning for learning’s sake to force the quantitative discussion of individual students’ grades into the open.” Wesleyan does bill itself as the type of place that fosters collaboration instead of competition and emphasizes joyful learning rather than cramming for the sake of a grade. It bills itself as the type of place that values creative contributions to campus just as much as academic ones, the type of place that encourages growing and learning over quantitative measures such as grades. For the most part, the University delivers. I rarely share grades with classmates and almost never feel that anybody is in competition with me, or I with them. When friends are performing or excelling in a non-academic pursuit, their success feels as valid and important as anything someone does in the classroom. And then the Dean’s List comes out.

"SHOFCO-Wesleyan Hosts Faculty Panel To Discuss Volunteering Abroad","2015-04-20","by Amelia Spittal, Staff Writer","Lex Spirtes, photo editor Wesleyan’s chapter of Shining Hope for Communities (SHOFCO) hosted a panel on April 16 titled “Volunteering Abroad: A Discussion on the Roles of Development.” Faculty members shared their experiences with international service work, discussing both its benefits and the controversies surrounding the practice. The speakers were Assistant Professor of Sociology Robyn Autry; Assistant Professor of History and Peace Corps alumna Laura Ann Twagira; Assistant Professor of Government and Peace Corps alumnus Michael Nelson; and John E. Andrus Professor of Sociology, Director of the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, and former SHOFCO board member Rob Rosenthal. The speakers dissected the concept of voluntourism—paying to go abroad to volunteer with a nonprofit organization—from sociological, governmental, historical, and personal perspectives. It centered on the question of whether or not certain forms of assistance and volunteer work are actually as beneficial as they are thought to be. Lex Spirtes ’17 offered one answer to this question by bringing up the way some programs may try to change the way people are living just because it is different from what the porgram’s participants are used to. “I think an issue is this idea of helping as mimicking our society somewhere else,” Spirtes said. “[There are people] saying that what we’re doing is right and the way that you’re living is less just because it’s different. There obviously are issues, especially with poverty and violence, but I feel like we’re also trying to fix things that aren’t necessarily broken, but are just different.” Former fellow of the SHOFCO Summer Institute Alix Haber ’11 also commented on how the SHOFCO Summer Institute is an exception to the way voluntourism usually goes. “The SHOFCO Summer Institute actually does it really well,” Haber said. “I mean, I ran it for two years, so I’m pretty biased as it goes. But the question is, what is your skill, what are you providing to the community that could not be found more easily and far more cheaply there? And the kind of summer camp that the Summer Institute offers with such a high level of engagement isn’t something that really exists in Kenya otherwise.” When the discussion shifted toward personal involvement with voluntourism, Nelson shared his experience as a member of the Peace Corps. “I got good advice going in, which was that you should listen to people, and that most of what you’re going to be doing is cultural exchange,” Nelson said. “If you go in thinking that you’re going to save the world, you’re going to be disappointed and also probably make mistakes.” Twagira, who also served in the Peace Corps, said that expecting cultural exchange, rather than simply acting as a Westerner trying to help, is a better and more realistic attitude to have about what programs like the Peace Corps do. “One of the reasons I decided to apply for the Peace Corps was the same good intention of wanting to learn more about the world, about my place in it, about having a more meaningful aspect to what I’m doing with my life,” Twagira said. “But I think one of the things that I took away from that is how much I learned from other people in the camp I was in in Mali. I was struck by how much Americans can learn from other cultures. For example, the way that babies are potty trained in Mali is amazing! They’re potty trained at such a young age. That’s just one example, but there are a lot of ways in which I sort of realized that this was a really rich place with lots of things to teach.” Toward the end of the panel, Jillian Roberts ’15, a member of SHOFCO-Wesleyan’s executive board, said that using volunteer opportunities to step away from a privileged life should not always be seen as negative. “I think there’s not necessarily a negative value to wanting to leave luxury for a moment, to push away from the privilege you have and be able to experience some manual labor and getting that hard work feeling,” Roberts said. “I think if that’s a momentary thing you want to experiment with, that’s something you might want to think twice about. But…if you want to use that as motivation to live the rest of your life in that way, using your privilege to do good things, then that’s good. But there’s a distinction between momentarily stepping out of your privilege and luxury and then coming back to it, and living by that guideline.”"
"Psi U Pledges Announce Litter Cleanup Initiative","2015-04-23","by Tom Fischer, Staff Writer","This year’s Psi U pledges are holding a litter clean up scheduled for April 27 as their community service project for the spring semester. c/o wesleying.org This year’s Psi Upsilon (Psi U) pledges are holding a litter cleanup scheduled for Monday, April 27 as their community service project for the spring semester. The cleanup will focus chiefly on the center of campus: Foss Hill, Andrus Field, around Usdan and College Row, and the backyards of houses around Fountain Avenue, with the possibility to extend further depending on participation. In an effort to bolster its engagement with the greater University and Middletown communities, the fraternity changed its policy this year so that the incoming pledge class now chooses their own project to undertake. Linsin Smith ’16, a pledge for Psi U, discussed the thinking behind the cleanup. “I was with a couple of other members of my pledge class, and we noticed how gross Foss is after everyone’s on it, like people forget to pick up their trash, there are no trashcans available, so it’s kind of a lose-lose situation,” Smith said. “We were just like, ‘Wow, what an easy thing, what a great thing we could do that would totally change Wesleyan just for a day and make it a clean space and really pick up and take care of this place.’” Fellow Psi U pledge Joseph Nucci ’16 is the event’s main organizer and also the owner of the event’s Facebook page. Nucci discussed his motivation behind the event and his publicity efforts. “Foss can get pretty messy, backyards can be just filled with litter, especially when it’s nice outside and people want to chill outside,” he said. “So we were thinking, ‘Wouldn’t it be great if we could just motivate the campus somehow to get more into picking up the trash around them when they see it?’ And we thought the easiest way to do that would be to launch an initiative.” Matthew Siegelman ’16, president of Psi U, agreed with the sentiments expressed by the pledges. He recalled the sight of Public Safety officers picking up litter after Zonker Harris Day as an impetus for the cleanup. “You know, I think that [Zonker Harris Day] was a really fun day for a lot of students, … [but] it’s kind of sad to see, at the end of the day, Public Safety officers walking around, putting litter away in trash bags and walking up the hill when that really shouldn’t be their job,” Siegelman said. “They have more important things to do, especially on Zonker Harris Day.” Nucci further commented on seeking to inspire widespread student involvement, citing an incident that occurred when he and other Psi U pledges were picking up trash. “For our [semester] community service project, a few of us were actually just picking up trash outside, and some people that came up to us—people that we knew, people that we didn’t—were like ‘Oh, thank you! This is great, but why are you doing this?’” he said. “And we thought that was kind of interesting. Even though it’s clearly a great thing to pick up litter, people were both surprised and…didn’t fully understand why you would engage with this.” Smith commented on the possibility of future litter cleanup initiatives, stating that, while it remains a possibility, there were no current plans to make the cleanup an annual event. “I think it would be really cool if it was always something that Psi U did,” Smith said. “I think that would be a cool annual or…bimonthly thing in the spring or in the fall, but I can’t speak for what future pledge classes will do. Maybe they’ll want to do some big community service event; it’s all kind of up to the pledge class at the time.” The cleanup is open to all, and although the event is a Psi U function, members of various campus Greek organizations are also invited. “You’ll see, all the pledges will be walking around with trash bags and gloves, and, if you want to be a part of it and get a bag, get a pair of gloves, you can go even if it’s just for five minutes,” Nucci said. Siegelman reaffirmed the importance of community service to Psi U and called for other Greek organizations to engage in service projects more often. “[Community service] is really core to Psi U, and that’s something that hasn’t changed this semester,” Siegelman said. “I would encourage every Greek organization to try and have more programs for themselves or in conjunction with other institutions, perhaps through the [Inter-Greek Council], to try and both benefit the school and also call attention to the importance of the continuation of Greek life on this campus.” Smith summarized her expectations for the cleanup, noting that it would be good both for the campus and the participants. “It should be cool, it should be fun, and hopefully it makes the campus look good,” Smith said. Nucci also expressed his hope for the success of the initiative, and said he hoped to see widespread participation from the greater student body. “This is one of those things, you know, that’s a really great idea in theory, but I’m interested and excited to see if Wesleyan rises to the challenge,” he said."
"Haffner ’76 Reflects on Life as a “Sexologist Minister”","2015-04-23","by Hyunji Ward, Assistant News Editor","Debra Haffner ’76 returned to the University on Wednesday, April 22, to deliver a lecture entitled, “Lessons from a Life in Sex and Ministry,” sponsored by The Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship. As an undergraduate, Haffner was co-founder of the University’s first Women’s Center, and went on to hold leadership roles at Planned Parenthood, the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SEICUS), and other not-for-profit organizations. Most recently she founded The Religious Institute, a multi-faith organization advocating for justice, sexual health, and education in faith communities and society at large. Now, she describes herself as a “Sexologist Minister.” Haffner began by describing her time at the University and the impact her undergraduate education had on her career. “Wesleyan launched my career in many ways… but not in the ways that I had expected,” Haffner said. “I came to campus in the fall of 1972. I was the second class of women who came in as freshmen, and I think that’s pretty hard to imagine today…. Women like me were still coming to college with the parental message that we were here to find a career that we could fall back on if our husbands died or left us.” Haffner noted that abortion was still illegal in Connecticut. Reflecting on her own experiences, and those of other female students, in terms of sexual misconduct, she emphasized the absence of terms or concepts like “date rape” or “sexual harassment.” “My sophomore year I took a women’s studies class,” Haffner said. “This course just exploded my world. All of a sudden, I was able to make sense of all those conflicting messages and was able to own who I was.” Haffner cites this class as the beginning of her career as a sex educator. She partnered with a fellow student, was given a $500 budget by the University, and founded the Wesleyan Women’s Center. “We struck for a gynecologist…this old guy who didn’t know how to do pelvic [exams], was not okay with us,” Haffner said. “We organized consciousness-raising groups, which were groups of women, but [also] co-ed, so women and men could talk about the impact of sexism growing up. We brought people to campus to teach women how to do plumbing and car repair.” After attending a women’s workshop organized by Our Bodies, Ourselves—in which the female workshop facilitator got up on a table, inserted a speculum into her vagina, and offered workshop attendees a flashlight with which to examine her cervix—Haffner and her colleague began hosting the same workshop every other week in Exley Science Center. Switching from a pre-law path to sexual education, Haffner quit her job and took a position at the Population Institute. She urged students to take their first job based on the organization itself, not on the position originally offered to them. “At the Population Institute… I would come in early and stay late… I started creating fact sheets for them, and I started to do extra research. I would put memos on their desk of interesting things I thought they needed to know when they came in in the morning.” She was promoted at the Public Health Service, after being the only employee still in the office after 5 p.m. At 23 years old, Haffner was given a $14,000,000 national program to set up adolescent health centers around the country. Once Haffner became the Executive Director of SEICUS, she organized health and sexuality organizations around the country in the production of the “Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education,” which are still widely used today. Haffner is also the author of seven books; her first one, “From Diapers to Dating,” continues to be the most successful. She commented on the importance of collaboration in any field. “We are smarter together than we are alone,” Haffner said. “No matter how good you are, how smart you are, how passionate you are, you don’t know everything, and other people can help you think. That’s really been a lesson that I’ve learned over and over again.” Haffner then described the most recent “turn” her life has taken, which began during a talk she was asked to give at her home congregation on sexuality and religion. “In the middle of that talk, I felt a call… this message of ‘this is what you’re supposed to do,’” said Haffner. “I’m from a Jewish background and am a Unitarian Universalist—we don’t get calls from anybody… this was not part of my experience at all.” She pointed to a quote from Frederick Buechner, a Presbyterian minister, to describe her understanding of “call” as the place “where the world’s greatest need meets your greatest joy.” “I’ve often thought, ‘Why didn’t I go into gun control?’ ‘Why didn’t I go into anti-racism?’” Haffner said. “Frankly, I’m always amazed that sexuality issues are the front page issues of political life… as important as I think those things are, I don’t think they’re the most important issues facing America, [but] they’re my issues. When I heard this line, I thought, ‘That’s what it is,’ finding that intersection between what I’m passionate about and what the world needs.” She concluded with some lessons for not-for-profit management, emphasizing the importance of maintaining relationships and asking for help when it’s needed. She also cited proficiency in finances as one of her most important skills, specifically the ability to read an audit or put a budget together. In terms of hiring, she advised students never to offer a position to someone they couldn’t imagine seeing every day. “One of the things I do often now, is take people out for meals before I hire them, and watch how they treat the wait staff,” Haffner said. “If I don’t like the way you treat the wait staff, I don’t want you working for me, because eventually you’re going to treat one of our customers like that, or one of our stakeholders, or me, like that.” Haffner referred back to her belief in working beyond the parameters of the traditional workday. “I have always worked harder than anyone who’s worked for me,” Haffner said. “I am always the first person in the office, and I’m still the last person to leave. I’ve been doing that now for close to 40 years. In order to get the best from people, I think that they need to see that I am full in.” Finally, she expressed the belief in staying involved programmatically, doing direct community outreach, and staying current. Haffner noted that after leaving SEICUS, she assumed she was finished having adventures, but that she realized life is constantly evolving. She described some of her most exciting moments since ministry, including marrying her two close friends after their 50-year relationship when gay marriage finally became legal in New York. “I’ve been to the Easter Prayer Breakfast at the White House,” said Haffner. “I’ve debated Bill O’Reilly several times on television, I did the blessing at Jane Fonda’s 70th birthday—that’s Rosie O’Donnell behind her, and Sally Field, and Lily Tomlin, and me—I got to hang out with these people. This picture is from a transgender day of remembrance… I was invited by the Peace Council to come to a meeting in Thailand with them, to talk about women and religion.” Civic Engagement Fellow Rosy Capron ’14 reacted to Haffner’s talk as an alumna. “It’s helpful to hear from someone who clearly enjoys the work that they do, and who has not only had a satisfying career, but also a really satisfying life,” Capron said. “Not necessarily an easy career or an easy life, but [she’s] always learning and reflecting.” Joanna Paul ’18 reflected on a more personal level. “I’m a Unitarian Universalist [UU] myself, so it was really cool for me to hear a fellow UU who actually went here, because I’m really interested in social justice,” Paul said. “Everything she said really speaks to me. I think the issues she focused on are really important. I liked the point about taking people out to dinner before hiring them… I thought that was really interesting.” Haffner’s final remarks were a testament to her experience at the University. “I’m grateful to Wesleyan for what it gave me and what I learned here,” Haffner said. “It was that girl with the speculum that’s still teaching pretty much the same thing, which is that our sexuality is a wonderful part of life, that we need education and information, and that we can bring our passion to make our world a better place for people.”"
"Staff Editorial: Final Notes, or How We Made This Newspaper","2015-05-04","by Gabe Rosenberg, Sofi Goode, Editors-in-Chief","Taking on the roles of Editors-in-Chief of The Wesleyan Argus for this semester, we had a few questions to answer: What is the role of The Argus at Wesleyan University? What is its role to the greater world? And further, what could its role be? After spending a few years as students here, working at The Argus, talking to community members, and reporting on this school, we took our leadership roles with the guiding philosophy that journalism is a social good. The Argus, we felt, should be a tool for students, faculty, alumni, and, especially in recent days, outsiders to better know and understand this diverse community. And it could do a better job than it has been doing. We set about making The Argus into a news outlet that would seek to serve everyone better. We believe that we made some headway, but that this is an ongoing project, one that we hope to see continue through next semester’s editors and future editors. There are two places where we sought to improve how The Argus functions: content and engagement. What we found was that the two came hand in hand. Strengthening our ties to the community not only expanded the audience of our stories but also inspired new stories for our audience. Prioritizing social media—specifically, our under-utilized Facebook and Twitter accounts—brought us in contact with a wide variety of students, faculty, and alumni who brought new issues to our attention. And, not insignificantly, we could keep a constant eye out for mentions of Wesleyan in the news. From those, we found out about fraternity lawsuits against the school, stumbled across media vitriol toward Open House, and kept up with developments in the series of drug-related incidents. Sometimes these leads have been rumors, which we’ve been able to dispel. Other times, we’ve been able to take information and run with it, using social media again to report what we have confirmed, even before our articles hit the press. (We’re not pretending like we’re breaking new ground here by using the Internet. The Argus has not done the best job at keeping up with the times; “digital first” is new to all newspapers, but caring about digital at all is brand-new to us.) We’ve become faster at getting information out to the public this semester while keeping our accuracy and accountability strong. Though we have stumbled and the news often runs faster than we can catch it, we hope that The Argus has become more useful to students in this way. We’ll improve with practice, and our readers will adjust to viewing The Argus not simply as a piece of paper on Tuesdays and Fridays. As our website and social media stats have shown this semester, many already have changed their view of The Argus. However, as students, we can’t be everywhere. It’s the major downside to being an all-volunteer, part-time group. We can’t be in court during trials or hearings, we can’t photograph every event, and we can’t report every individual’s opinion. If only we could—a more informed community is a stronger community, a more powerful community. Even at a school as involved as Wesleyan, much goes unnoticed and unreported. The Argus is connected to this community, and the more people who engage with The Argus, the more relevant, diverse, and useful it can become. We are a student newspaper, and we hope people use us as such. Often, students and alumni lash out against The Argus (yes, we do hear you) online, in our comments section, on Yik Yak, on the ACB, over email, and in person. People feel slighted by a perceived bias in our reporting and become angry at us for not considering another side, or for not highlighting a specific group or activity. Some feedback has been useful to us, and we’ve taken it to heart by making our coverage more sensitive in some areas, pursuing new angles to stories, and finding the gaps in our editing process. (It’s actually been a few years since the editors of The Argus have published editorials; we see them as part of our mission to maintain transparency about our process as well as to a way of representing our organization to the public.) Journalism is a collaborative process. It is reflective of who is writing, certainly, as well as of who talks to those writers. The Argus is always trying to recruit new students to join our staff (it’s never too late to start!), but beyond that, we are always asking students to speak to us about what they care about. We can’t know your feelings if you don’t talk to us; moreover, we can’t report them. Being interviewed, writing a Wespeak, or contacting us about important campus events and conversations allows us to hear and better represent you and the Wesleyan community. We want more voices, not fewer; we want to improve representation, not diminish it; we want to widen perspectives, not narrow them. We want to reveal and showcase the diversity of this University, its graduates, and its workers. We want to know more about this school so that it may be improved. We can’t do that without the participation of you, our readers and our sources. An Argus that is sensitive to and predictive of the needs of the Wesleyan community is beneficial to all. You’re reading and interacting with us more than ever, and it both reflects and improves the quality of our work. We pass along the reins of this newspaper to its next leaders, and a staff of which we are confident and proud. We hope our readers trust and work with them as they have with us. Help us continue to build The Argus we need at Wesleyan."
"Broccoli City Forum Discusses Sustainability Issues, Projects","2015-05-04","by Amelia Spittal, Staff Writer","On May 2, the Broccoli City Organic Lifestyle Group sponsored the Broccoli City Forum at the University to discuss sustainability.The Broccoli City Organic Lifestyle Group sponsored the Broccoli City Forum at the University on Saturday, May 2. Juliana Manrique ’15, Kate Weiner ’15, and Rina Kremer ’15 were joined on the panel by Director of the Office of Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias and Director of Feet to the Fire Erin Roos-Brown. The event took place in the Bessie Schonberg Dance Studio and featured artwork on display as well as a projected slideshow of different pictures from this year’s Broccoli City Festival. Kimora Brock ’15 and Kafilah Muhammad ’18 facilitated a discussion focused on sustainability and the importance of uniting environmental causes with social projects. The discussion emphasized the speakers’ advice and insight, based on their personal experiences with similar projects. Farias discussed his interest in environmental issues and their effect on communities. These interests stemmed from his own experiences growing up in the Bronx. “I’ve been here for about a year and a half, and what I see is that we need to reconnect some of these questions of environmentalism and sustainability with ones of diversity and inclusion and equity,” Farias said. “I grew up in the Bronx, and I had asthma. And I had this question of…why do I have asthma…. And if you know anything about the environment and how it impacts underdeveloped communities… You can use the term environmental racism.” He added that it took him a while to understand this term. “When I went off and joined the army, we were in Jordan, and for some reason I went from…walking around with an inhaler, to all of a sudden being able to breathe,” Farias said. “It took me years to understand that it was the environment, the pollutants that were in my city.” Campus & Community Engagement Manager Erin Roos-Brown manages Feet to the Fire, a program at the University dedicated to examining environmental issues through multiple lenses. She spoke about her past experiences and mistakes working in sustainability and what she learned from them. “About two years ago, it…seemed like what we were doing in Feet to the Fire wasn’t all that effective,” Roos-Brown said. “The students…were doing a lot of great, creative things, and that seemed to be what people were more interested in…. So that’s when we decided we were going to start transitioning Feet to the Fire to be a lot more about supporting student projects and really engaging students in their own place. What we learned from this is that when you think you’ve got your project just right, it probably needs to change. There’s something you need to tweak, something you need to do. If it is going to survive, it has to evolve.” When asked what makes a project a success, Kremer—a member of the sustainability group WILD Wes and the Local Foods Co-op—said that the ability to compromise is a necessity when you are working on forming a new group on campus. “Communication and an openness to go in a different direction than first intended [are important],” Kremer said. “You can’t make enemies with the University. While they might not be as lenient or think the same way that you do about your project, you will be able to gain ground with them when you make compromises and work with them.” Manrique, who runs the Wesleyan Students for Sustainable Fashion group, said that another important aspect of creating a successful project is perseverance. “I would say that you definitely need determination,” Manrique said. “You need…to get support from the University, from students, and then on top of that, you need funding. You apply for grants and you’ll be turned down numerous times, but you have to persevere and keep your goal in mind. If it’s something that you really want to expand, that you’re really passionate about, then there’s no reason why you shouldn’t really see it through.” In closing, the panelists were asked what advice they would give to students looking to get involved with one of the many environmentalist and sustainability groups on campus. “Just join,” Kremer said. “We have so many student groups on campus trying to get their projects off the ground or trying to sustain themselves, and they’re really looking for anyone…who’s willing and wanting to get involved…. Even if you know nothing about the environment and what the group really does, just go to a meeting. They’ll welcome you.”"
"Princeton Review Ranks University #1 Impact School","2015-09-07","by Natasha Nurjadin, Assistant News Editor","University tops Princeton Review's Best Schools for Making an Impact, with most on-campus student engagement and community service opportunities.The University has been ranked #1 on Princeton Review’s list of “Best Schools for Making an Impact” this year, a new category of college rankings published in the Review’s “Colleges That Pay You Back: The 200 Best Value Colleges and What It Takes to Get In (College Admissions Guides).” According to the Princeton Review, the list of “Best Schools for Making an Impact” are schools that feature the best community service opportunities, student governments, sustainability, and on-campus student engagement. They are also schools with the highest reported percentage of alumni with high job meaning. “Students say that the ‘open and engaging student culture’ is the University’s greatest strength: Students are ‘at the heart of global issues’ thanks to the ‘vibrant student culture and activism,’” the Princeton Review website reads. “The Connecticut school is known for its community service and commitment, headlined by the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship.” The Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship (PCSE) is a campus resource that encourages and supports students and alumni who are interested in social entrepreneurial ventures, including creating and sustaining programs, businesses, and organizations. They hold programs to help develop student programs and also offer grants for students who are interested in developing new programs. Lily Herman ’16 is the founder of The Prospect, a website utilized by high school students to help through the college process. Today, it has around 600,000 users. “It’s awesome that Wesleyan is on the list for being an impact school,” Herman said. “There’s been a lot of work done in recent years by the Center for Community Partnerships, the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and other departments to ensure that students are getting a thoughtful and well-rounded education on what civic engagement is really about.” Makaela Kingsley, director of PCSE, wrote in an email to The Argus that she believes social impact has always been a core component of the University culture and philosophy. “I don’t think [this list] says anything about our community that we didn’t already know,” Kingsley wrote. “I’ve joked that this ranking just means the secret is out, that the world is starting to recognize what we witness every day: students and alumni who are passionate about social change, with an academic and extra-curricular education that uniquely prepares them to have impact.” Kingsley believes that the ranking reflects how passionate the students at the University are about being change-makers tackling social issues. “Today, ‘practical idealism’ continues to characterize a Wesleyan education,” Kingsley wrote. “We attract students, faculty, and staff who think critically, draw important connections between disciplines, and seek ways to contribute to the common good.” With this ranking, Kingsley has high hopes for the development of PCSE and that students take advantage of these resources to continue making an impact. “I hope prospective students choose to come to Wesleyan not just for our academic reputation, but also because we are a premier school for social entrepreneurs and changemakers,” Kingsley wrote. The Patricelli Center will continue to hold and introduce new social impact programs, including the Wesleyan Social Impact Summit, a program that will bring together students and alumni to discuss and share resources on what they are passionate about during the weekend of Nov. 13-14. The event will feature panelists including prominent Wesleyan alumni, small group programs to facilitate discussion, and networking opportunities for students and alumni alike. “A lot of the social impact programs on campus are on the newer side, so I’m really excited to see how those continue to grow and develop in the coming years,” Herman said. Caroline Liu ’18, the intern for the Social Impact Summit, said that the ranking reflects the image of the University of one that promotes social change. “I’m not surprised that Wesleyan is number one [on the list],” Liu said. “But I don’t think it’s a reason to pat ourselves on the back or feel that we’re finished with our work. I think that we received this title because we always had a culture of caring about making change, and it’s not like this title should make us feel that we’ve achieved our goal.”"
"The Argus Welcomes New Tenure-Track Faculty","2015-09-07","by Jenny Davis, Features Editor","New tenure-track faculty dish on their journeys to Wes, the projects that excite them, and what they do when they're not teaching.This fall, the University welcomed a broad array of new tenure-track faculty members. The Argus discussed with these professors the paths that took them to Wesleyan, their current projects, and their lives outside the classroom.   Francesco Marco Aresu, Assistant Professor of Italian The Argus: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? Marco Aresu: I work on medieval and early-modern literature: Influential personalities in my field very rarely make it to the news. I prefer to mention “heroes” at the intersection between academia and civil society. Next year is the anniversary of the 1966 flood of the Arno in Florence. Volunteers from around the world (the so-called Mud Angels) convened to Florence to clean the city from the mud, to retrieve books and work of arts from flooded rooms, and to rescue the traces of the past for the spiritual growth of future generations. Very peculiar heroes, indeed.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? MA: With a former colleague from Harvard University I am working on a recently re-discovered manuscript of Leon Battista Alberti, an Italian humanist of the 15th century. I am also working on my first book, which studies how different media (manuscripts, prints, kindle, etc.) affect the composition, circulation, and reception of the literary texts that they transmit.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Any special talents or hobbies? MA: I like to learn languages (I am in the process of picking the ninth language I will study). I work out every day. And I love me some good red wine. Not necessarily in this order.   Joseph Coolon, Assistant Professor of Biology The Argus: What’s the most important thing for you about working with students? Joseph Coolon: I really enjoy seeing the moment when things click for people. One of the things that’s really important to me is reaching students who may have never considered the subject that I’m teaching something that they might care about, or need to know, or be interested in.   A: What’s one project or idea that you’re really excited about? JC: The research in my lab is generally focused on looking at how the DNA that different species contain allows different species to be different. Specifically, the work is looking at how changes in DNA influence these differences between species, not in terms of what products are being made by those genes, but by how those genes are turned on and turned off, and when, where, and how much of them are being made.   A: What do you enjoy outside the classroom? JC: I quite enjoy running. I quite enjoy fishing. I like bike riding as well. So I guess a lot of more active outdoor sports.   Candice Etson, Assistant Professor of Physics The Argus: What’s the most crucial part of teaching for you? Candice Eston: There have been people who have taken time out of their lives to do something small that really made a big difference to me. It’s really critical in fields like science, where there are so many different paths, and it’s not always clear how you get from one place to another, that people take the time to tell you what your opportunities are. People really did that for me, and it made me want to give that back. And then in my own field, there are not a lot women or minorities, so I feel really lucky to have had the opportunities I had. I’d really like to be a part of letting those opportunities be available to more people….When you have people with different perspectives, who come from different places and different backgrounds, everything is better. It’s so much more interesting, you get such better work done, and amazing things can happen. I also just love teaching. I think the stuff I do is really cool, so I like to let other people know about that.   A: What is one research project or idea that you’re really excited about right now? CE: I’m really excited about a project that I’m just now getting going. There are two major projects I’m working on. One is in the lab, and then I have this education research project I’m doing, which I’m actually not going to tell you too much about, because Wesleyan students are going to be the research subjects. I’m really excited to be doing science education research to try to find out how the way people think and do problem-solving is important for science education, and the goal of that is to make the way we teach physics better. I’m excited about that. Everyone at Wesleyan is really into it, and that’s been great.   A: You were a ballet dancer and you’re an artist. What connections have you found between science and art? CE: In ballet, there’s this sort of approach, like a mindset, that you never really feel that anything you do is finished or perfect, so you just keep working on it. When you learn to be a ballet dancer, the first things you learn are pliés and tendus, and until the day you stop doing ballet, you will do pliés and tendus, and you will always try to make them better. And so that kind of approach, and that mindset, and that discipline, has always served me really well—that idea that you can always find something new, even in something really simple that you learned as a kid.   Anthony Hatch, Assistant Professor of Science in Society  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan?  Anthony Hatch: Wesleyan’s intellectual culture and commitment to liberal education as reflected in its faculty and students were the biggest draws for me. I am especially excited about being a member of the truly interdisciplinary Science in Society Program. There are very few programs like it in the country that draw on so many diverse fields of inquiry.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching?  AH: I love the ways in which teaching is a special kind of performance art. I very much consider my time with my students in the classroom as an intimate and personal show. Like the best artists, I aim to bring high energy and serious preparation to every single class and hope that illumination and new understandings emerge for myself and my students.   A: What’s one project or idea you’re excited about right now?  AH: I’m most excited about my new book titled “Blood Sugar: Racial Pharmacology and Food Justice in Black America” that will be published this winter with the University of Minnesota Press. In this book, I analyze and challenge the ways in which “metabolic syndrome” has emerged as a major biomedical category that medical researchers have created to better understand the health risks of high blood sugar, blood pressure, body fat, and cholesterol. I argue that the metabolic syndrome also represents another, very real crisis: Its advent signals a new form of “colorblind scientific racism” that repackages race within biomedical and genomic research.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Talents or hobbies?  AH: I most enjoy traveling, reading, and laughing with my sweet family. I also enjoy early morning jogging—something I never thought I would say! At one point in a past life, I could make a fair claim to be a triple threat in the performing arts: I could dance, sing, and play a musical instrument (the violin). I’m way too rusty to call them “talents” or “hobbies” but I could probably complete a decent grande jete if you put me on the spot.   Jeffrey Naecker, Assistant Professor of Economics  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Jeff Naecker: The entire Economics Department at Wesleyan is incredibly impressive: producing well-published research while also teaching rigorous classes to extremely intellectual students. I’m honored to have a chance to work with everyone here. Wesleyan also reminds me a lot of my undergraduate time at Berkeley: smart, athletic, and socially engaged students on a purposefully inclusive and active campus.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? JN: Teaching is one of the most value-creating things we can do as human beings. It involves organizing a potentially very large set of knowledge into a form that students can digest, re-interpret, and ultimately pass on to others. That creation and transmission of information is exhilarating and rewarding.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? JN: Here’s a little mental experiment: Suppose I give you $10 and tell you that you can split it however you choose between two poor households in Kenya that I’ve identified. After you tell me how you’d like to allocate the money, I’ll flip a coin. If it’s heads, I’ll allocate as you asked. But if it’s tails, I’ll allocate  differently: all $10 to household A and none to household B.  So, how would you like to split the money? Here’s the twist: Suppose that I’ve flipped the coin and I double-check your allocation with you before implementing it.  Do you want to change your allocation? In a paper I’m writing right now with several co-authors, we show in a series of experiments that many people choose $0 to A and $10 to B initially — they are offsetting the default allocation.  But after the coin flip, they want to switch to to an equal split: $5 each.  It turns out this behavior is hard to explain with standard economic theories. Put another way, we as economists are still learning about how people define fairness, and how the definition depends on the context and the timing of the decision.   Paula Park, Assistant Professor of Spanish  The Argus: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? Paula Park: Basing this question on my current research, I would say that four major heroes in my field are José Rizal, José Martí, Eugenio María de Hostos and Lola Rodríguez de Tió. They were all compromised intellectuals and proponents of the independence of their homelands (Philippines, Cuba and Puerto Rico), as well as active seekers of transnational unity against colonial powers.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? PP: When I look back at the courses I have taught in the past years in three universities, stories of all kinds come to mind. But ultimately the most rewarding memory is simple and yet abstract: having provided students with the opportunity to confront something new. My goal in the classroom is to enable students to discover new interests of their own through the study of Spanish language and Hispanic culture. Also, for me, human interaction is at the core of teaching and learning, so I really enjoy seeing my students collaborating with each other for assignments in class or even outside of class.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? PP: Right now am excited about two projects. On the one hand I look forward to being able to work on my first book project, which examines the influences of writers from Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines after 1898, that is, right after they ceased to be connected through the logic of the Spanish empire and became subject to US expansionism. On the other hand, I am also excited about a more personal academic project. Born to Korean immigrants in Chile, I am interested in the cultural productions of diverse Asian diasporas throughout Latin America and the Hispanic Caribbean. I will offer a course that will cover this topic in the spring semester.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Any special talents or hobbies? PP: I like hiking or simply walking around cities, especially if it’s in good company. Since I’ve moved to Connecticut, I’ve enjoyed exploring Hartford. At home, I’m enjoying playing the piano again.   Michelle Personick, Assistant Professor of Chemistry The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Michelle Personick: I’ve known that I wanted to teach at a small liberal arts college as long as I’ve known I wanted to be a professor. I went to a NESCAC school (Middlebury) myself as an undergrad and I think the small liberal arts college is a fantastic model for undergraduate education because it provides opportunities for faculty and students to actually get to know each other and for faculty to be able to take an active interest in students’ success. As a graduate student at a research university, I was responsible for a lecture with 350 students, and at that point it’s hard to reach out to individual students who might be struggling, unless they take the initiative and come to office hours. Wesleyan was a particularly special opportunity for me as a scientist because of the strong research programs here at Wes. Having a small, but talented, group of graduate students in chemistry increases the quality and variety of scientific resources available to all students on campus, and means that I’m able to introduce undergrads to my area of research—metal nanomaterials—which is something I wouldn’t be able to do at a lot of other liberal arts schools.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? MP: My biggest influences have generally been the people who have directly mentored me: a graduate student a year ahead of me in grad school, as well as my undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral advisors. It may not seem as exciting as the big “heroes” of the field, but those were the people I saw every day, doing science and being leaders in their areas. Those are the people you watch and think, “How do they do that?”—whether they’re conducting experiments, or coming up with ideas, or giving presentations. And then a younger scientist comes up to you sometime later and says the same thing to you, and you realize those people have been teaching you how all along.   A: What’s one project you’re excited about right now? MP: One big exciting project for me right now is setting up my research lab and starting to do experiments. I have a brand new space that I’ve been stocking with shiny new glassware and supplies over the summer with help from a couple of research students. The lab has begun to be operational in the last few weeks and we’ve done some initial experiments, which is great. This fall we’ll be building a new piece of equipment and we’ll have some new students joining the research group so I’m excited to see where things are a few months from now.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom or lab? Any special talents or hobbies? MP: Before I came to Wesleyan, I was living in the Boston area and I trained and competed with a masters women’s rowing team. I loved being on the Charles River early in the morning and enjoyed getting to know a lot of awesome women who came from a wide range of backgrounds. I miss it, and I’m hoping to get out on the Connecticut River in the not-too-distant future.   Felipe Ramírez, Assistant Professor of Math  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Felipe Ramírez: It’s a great university and math department. Also, I like that both research and teaching are emphasized equally here. At many other places the faculty are expected to concentrate on one more than the other. But research and teaching are both important aspects of my life, and I wouldn’t want to give either one up in favor of the other.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? FR: I truly enjoy meeting my students, interacting with them, etc. But my answer for this one was a bit more selfish: By teaching, I improve my own understanding of the material. Students often ask questions that I’ve never considered before, and this forces me to think about old ideas in new ways. I enjoy the challenge of seeking explanations from these new points-of-view, and the feeling of discovery when I find them. Also, it is very common for some random piece of a course to make it’s way into my research, often when the two seem totally unrelated. Sometimes I’ll be stuck on something for days, only to discover a solution waiting for me in my own lecture notes.   A: What’s a project you’re excited about right now? FR: Lately (meaning the last couple of years) I’ve been interested in a field of mathematics called Diophantine approximation, where we try to quantify how closely irrational numbers (non-fractions) can be approximated by rational numbers (fractions). As simple as it sounds, there are still many open, profound, beautiful problems in this area, and even some that have potential “real-world” applications. Even better, there are many deep connections between Diophantine approximation and my main line of research: ergodic theory and dynamical systems, where we study the long-term behavior of systems that change in time. I find these problems and their connections to dynamics fascinating.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? FR: I have always loved music. I taught guitar throughout my undergraduate years, and nowadays I play mostly for my daughter, who is one year old and doesn’t let me get through two bars before she’s swatting and banging at the strings. I also love puzzles, especially crosswords. I rarely skip a day. (NYT almost exclusively, though I did take up the Guardian’s cryptics during the five years I lived in England.) I also read, watch movies, etc. Mostly, though, my free time is spent with my wife and daughter. We’re new to Connecticut, so we have a lot to discover!   Ying Jia Tan, Assistant Professor of History  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? YJT: I have always wanted to teach at a liberal arts college with a vibrant and diverse student population, which allows me to develop as a scholar and teacher. There are many programs for civic engagement with local communities and the broader region, which allows the students to see the connection between what they learn in the classroom and the world around them.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? YJT: I certainly refrain from worshipping heroes in my academic field. As a historian of science, I believe that the pursuit of knowledge is not the result of the work of a single genius, but the collective endeavor of all levels of society. Take the light bulb for example. It is too simplistic to say that it was invented by Thomas Edison. Rather, the development of manufacturing systems, the financing that supported the growth of power-generation and delivery systems, and growing perception of the safety of electric light all contributed to the popularization of the light bulb. As a scholar of Chinese history, I am deeply motivated by the educational philosophy of a twelfth-century Neo-Confucian philosopher Zhu Xi (1130-1200). Many of his conversations with his students revolve around the meaning of education. He advocated the idea of “Greater Learning,” through which students should be instructed in the extension of knowledge, understand the principles of nature, and learn the basic values of loyalty and filial piety.   A: What’s one project that you’re excited about right now? YJT: I am excited about my book project about the history of electricity in wartime China. My work looks at the East Asian energy crisis, which started with the outbreak of the second Sino-Japanese War (1937-1945) and never really ended. I examine how the Guomindang and Communist regimes dealt with power shortages. The formative years of China’s energy industry overlapped with the years of war, which forced the Guomindang and the Communists to integrate the energy sector with national security interest. This project allows us to understand what the term “energy security” means in China today.   Shellae Versey, Assistant Professor of Psychology    The Argus: Who are some of your heroes or major influences in your field? Shellae Versey: That’s a difficult one! It’s hard to narrow it down, because there are so many people I admire, who are pushing the traditional boundaries of psychology in order to move the field forward. But I think if I had to name heroes, I’d say Kenneth and Mamie Clark’s work initially drew me to study psychology, initially as a graduate student, because their work still impacts social psychology and other fields as well. And then I’m also deeply influenced by the work of Patricia Hill-Collins, Kimberle’ Crenshaw, and bell hooks, who engage in difficult dialogues around issues of gender, race, identity, and engagement in a purposeful way.   A: What’s your favorite thing about working with students? SV: I actually get really excited working with students. I think that, especially in a small, seminar-style class, you get the opportunity to interact with and get to know students, how they’re thinking and processing the material. I often get asked very real and practical, useful questions, either about the content that we’re covering or about my own research, that I’ve not considered before or thought about through a particular lens. It’s refreshing to have that experience in the classroom, where everyone feels that they’re fulfilled and part of the learning experience, myself included.   A: What is one project or idea that you’re really excited about right now? SV: A new project I’m excited about starting is exploring neighborhood social engagement among different age groups. One of the areas I study is aging. I’m always interested in the question of how older adults remain socially engaged as they get older, and what factors facilitate either engagement or withdrawal and isolation, and ultimately [I hope to] have a sense of how being socially engaged—or lack thereof—correlates with mental health.   A: What do you enjoy outside the classroom? What are your passions, talents, or hobbies? SV: I don’t have any special talents! But I do enjoy reading for leisure, which is harder than I thought it would be—just to pick up a book and read it. So when I get time I like to read, I like to exercise, and I like to scrapbook and do photography, which might be a little different. I enjoy anything in general that’s off the beaten path. I like to be outdoors and just enjoy life. I’m trying to live in the moment and embrace the spirit of mindfulness, which I think as a society we’re engaging in as a collective conversation.   Yamil Velez, Assistant Professor of Government  The Argus: What drew you to Wesleyan? Yamil Velez: Wesleyan has always stood out in my mind as a university that encourages activism and student engagement. As an instructor, there is nothing better than having a classroom full of thoughtful and interested students.   A: Who are some of your major influences or heroes in your field? YV: Ryan Enos, Dan Hopkins, and Ben Newman are some of my major influences. They’ve caused me to think about my research in a new way and are excellent people to boot.   A: What’s your favorite thing about teaching? YV: One of the most satisfying aspects of teaching is watching students come in with very little background knowledge and leave with a deep understanding of the material. I love when students push back against the literature and craft their own arguments about the material.   A: What’s one project or idea you’re excited about right now? YV: I have a project examining the effects of residential mobility options on the desire for local residents to either fight or flee immigration. Given recent rhetoric on the topic and demographic trends in the U.S., I think understanding how citizens respond to immigrants is of importance. We need to do a better job of encouraging cooperation between native-born residents and immigrants.   A: What do you enjoy outside of the classroom? Do you have any special talents or hobbies? YV: Music has always been a huge part of my life. I’ve been making electronic music since I was about 12 and I’m a classically trained guitarist. If I’m not conducting research or planning lessons, I’m likely playing guitar or messing with Ableton Live. It’s a stubborn passion of mine."
"StartupWeekend Attracts Aspiring Entrepreneurs","2015-09-24","by Tom Fischer, Staff Writer","The University is hosting its first ever “startup weekend” in hopes of providing business-minded students and aspiring entrepreneurs a forum to test ideas and learn the basics of developing and marketing a product.  The University is hosting its first-ever “startup weekend” in hopes of providing business-minded students and aspiring entrepreneurs a forum to test ideas and learn the basics of developing and marketing a product. The event, formally called “StartupWeekend of Central Connecticut,” will begin on Friday, Oct. 2, and end on Sunday, Oct. 4. It is sponsored by the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship (PCSE), but will be run by the organization StartupWeekend. The weekend will consist of idea-pitching, product development workshops, and other activities, some of which are competitive. Prizes for the winning teams vary from free legal advice to several months’ worth of free incubator space. Makaela Kingsley, Director of the PCSE, commented on the nature of the organization and the event they are orchestrating. “StartupWeekend is an international organization that provides a framework for doing an event like this,” Kingsley said. “It’s a two-and-a-half-day intensive learning experience where students, professionals, community members come together, pitch ideas, form teams around some of the best of those ideas, and then literally build the framework for a startup over the course of that weekend. Some of these startups go on to become real, functioning companies. Others, it just becomes an incredible learning experience for the people involved.” Yekaterina Sapozhnina ’16, founder of the Wesleyan Entrepreneurship Society, is pleased with the way in which the event is designed. “It’s really great because you come in with zero experience, or tons of experience—[people] come from all different states and different cities, so it’s generally people from all over [who] gather for this event,” Sapozhnina said. “It’s very inclusive and it’s a really nice way to get some experience with building, like, thinking through a business model and about markets…. It’s kind of like a Hackathon, a high-pressure environment where you only have a couple of days, so people don’t sleep much, really work hard, and it’s very high pressured.” Kingsley recalled attending a similar event last year, and described her thought process for deciding to bring the event to the University. “I went up to StartupWeekend Hartford last fall and met with all the teams and got to see the event in progress, which is really why and when I said, ‘We should do one of these at Wesleyan,’” Kingsley said. “I just thought the experience was unique and influential for these students and…I’d like to see what happens if we do it here and more students get to participate, because going back and forth to Hartford is very challenging. So, if we did it here on this campus, it would open it up to more students.” Alex Garcia ’17, a member of the winning team at last year’s StartupWeekend Hartford, described the experience. “We built a peer-mentoring application geared towards community college students, since they don’t have a residential life like we do here at Wesleyan, and Goodwin College President [Mark Scheinberg] was there, and he offered money on the spot for us to implement it at his college,” Garcia said. “This summer, we did a bunch of trials just to see how students interacted, and…we have a ways to go in terms of finding the right balance of student engagement and connecting them to other students to work with.” Garcia further commented on the makeup of his team, emphasizing the benefits of such events for drawing in students from a wide area. “We have a team in Hartford, Penn State, and at Wesleyan,” Garcia said. “That’s sort of the beauty of StartupWeekend, it’s not just one college bubble, but people from all over… Currently, most of the efforts are happening at Penn State right now since a lot of our development team is there.” Sapozhnina added that such condensed competitions are more beneficial for some rather than others. “Yeah, I think it matters from where you’re coming into this,” Sapozhnina said. “If you just want to get your feet wet, you haven’t really participated in lengthier business competitions before, it’s a superb way to see how what kind of ideas are out there, what kind of trends are happening in the market right now, what kind of steps are required to go from one [idea] to execution to a minimal viable product… It’s very entry-level, so it’s great if you’re just starting out and it’s good if you have an idea you’re not very attached to and just want to see what happens.” Kingsley stated her hopes for the event, expressing hope that the event would draw a diverse array of schools. “One hope is that it will be a chance for entrepreneurs or aspiring entrepreneurs or creative people from Wesleyan to connect and work with similar students from other schools,” Kingsley said. “…we’re working hard to get students from other liberal arts schools that are more similar to Wesleyan… I also, most simply, just want students to have that experience of what it’s like to go from pitching an idea to seeing the product that you might develop over the course of two-and-a-half days. It’s not just a lot of learning, but also a lot of fun.” Tickets for the weekend cost $25 for students."
"Professor’s Bookshelf: John Finn","2015-10-08","by Jake Lahut, Staff Writer","Government professor John Finn opens up about the Constitution, French cooking, and law school. c/o thegreatcourses.com Professor of Government John Finn, specializing in constitutional law, is the author of several books on constitutional theory and is currently writing a cookbook on omelets. He sat down with The Argus to discuss civic engagement, the inadequacies of American omelets, and how he drove his college to bankruptcy.   The Argus: Why teach at Wesleyan? John Finn: That’s an interesting question and one that I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about over the 25 to 30 years I’ve been here, because for some of my time here, I’ve had the distinct impression that some of my colleagues in the broadest sense of the term really doubt whether there’s an appropriate role for legal education in a liberal arts setting. And I want to be clear that it’s not my department [Government] that feels that way. It’s in the broadest sense. I get asked this question all the time: Why aren’t you teaching at a law school? I get asked by my colleagues. I get asked by my students. I get asked by Wesleyan alumni, by Wesleyan parents. And my answer is one that has really forced me to think about what the role of law is or should be in a liberal arts curriculum. So broadly speaking, I sort of subscribe to a really old fashioned notion that an important part of being a citizen in a liberal democracy is understanding that you have obligations to other people, not simply rights, and I think it’s a critical part of any liberal arts education to understand what citizenship means and to be engaged in citizenship as a real practical everyday kind of activity. My scholarship is centered around that question and I’d like to think my teaching is as well. I really feel comfortable at Wesleyan. I would not want to teach in a law school, which—without criticizing anything—is I think a little bit too pre-professional and narrow-minded for the sorts of things I would like to do.   A: Could you tell us more about your scholarship and how you would explain what you do to someone who may not even be that familiar with the Constitution itself? JF: My scholarship runs along two tracks that probably don’t have that much to do with each other. Most of it is centered around questions of constitutional theory both comparative and domestic. What I’m really interested in is how constitutional orders maintain themselves, how they survive, how they decay over time. I’m interested in other words, as I put it in my most recent book, what does it mean to live a constitutional way of life? So that’s not the study of Supreme Court cases per se, it’s not the study of constitutional provisions per se. It’s more about what it means to call ourselves a constitutional community and what do we need to do to make good on promises made to that community, as well as how we fail to achieve those promises.   A: When you’re not reading really dense legal texts about a document as vague as the Constitution, what do you like to read for pleasure or to simply inform yourself as a citizen? JF: That sort of builds on the last question. My other area of scholarship is food studies, so I spend a lot of time reading and collecting food books of all sorts. Some of them are as simple and straight forward as cookbooks, which I love to collect and read, but a lot of them are as advanced as food and cultural theory. Some of it exists in the margins. The book I read most recently that I got the most pleasure out of was a cookbook from the early 1970s written by Salvador Dali.   A: Salvador Dali wrote cookbooks? JF: Yeah! Well, one, anyway. [Laughs] If you know anything about Salvador Dali, you don’t have to see his name on the cover to know it’s quintessential Salvador Dali. I’m thinking about making a movie where over the course of a year I cook every single one of Dali’s recipes.   A: So, if I’m not mistaken, you’re a trained French chef. Could you tell us more about what it took to get certified? JF: This is something I probably shouldn’t say out loud, but I took one of my sabbaticals and went to culinary school in New York City at the French Culinary Institute. In any event, I’d like to think that the University got some value out of it, because I do teach food courses here from time to time, and I’ve published a fair amount on food-related stuff. So yeah, that was a blast. It was hard to get that degree. I can honestly say, of all of my higher degrees, I had more difficulty getting the culinary degree than any other one.   A: Could you please list your degrees so we could get some context on how difficult this was? JF: Yeah so, B.A. at Nasson College, which went bankrupt shortly after I graduated, maybe because I didn’t pay back my student loans, but I couldn’t have been the only one who did…. Then I got a law degree from Georgetown and a Masters and Ph.D from Princeton, and then the culinary degree. Of all of them, the culinary degree was far and away the most difficult—it’s the only one that was dangerous. I could and did hurt myself, whereas I was fine getting a Ph.D.   A: What does a good meal consist of for you now that you have this degree? JF: I still love to cook classical French and Continental European food. For right now, a good meal is a finely prepared omelet. I’m actually writing a cookbook on omelets, so I spend every weekend trying new recipes for omelets.   A: This might not make any difference, but I have a friend who’s really interested in the two different styles of omelet cooking, French and American. What’s the difference between the two? JF: One is classic and one is a cheap knockoff. [Laughs] No I don’t really mean that. The French omelet is softer, it shouldn’t have any color, and it’s runnier, whereas an American omelet is cooked more fully, it’s drier, and it’s pretty simple. You just fold the damn thing in half. My book has four master styles for the four kinds of omelets.   A: What advice would you give to a Wesleyan student considering going to law school? JF: First, I would say go into it eyes-open because even though some people think the market has rebounded—if it has at all—it’s a slow process, so it’s not like a law degree is like the Willy Wonka golden ticket to happiness. It’s a tough go, and there’s a reason why every survey on happiness puts lawyers at the very bottom of the list. But that said, the most important thing I would tell anyone thinking about going to law school is to major in whatever you want to major in. There’s no reason at all to think that you have to major in Government or one of the social sciences. I haven’t done this in a while and I’m glad you reminded me of it. When people come to me and say, “Should I go to law school?” I would give them a letter that Felix Frankfurter wrote to a 12-year-old boy that said, “Study whatever you want; learn to love learning.” There is no particular approach that’s going to make you better off or more prepared. I haven’t had the most successful life, but I ended up here without taking any law as an undergraduate. This interview was edited for length."
"University’s Greek Community Hosts Inaugural Harvest Festival","2015-10-12","by Camille De Beus, Staff Writer","The University's InterGreek Council Hosted its first-ever Harvest Festival during Saturday's football game. Students and members of the community attended the inaugural Fall Harvest Festival, an event hosted by the University’s Greek life organizations, on Saturday, Oct. 10. “It’s a joint effort by the whole Greek community to bring in both the Middletown and Wesleyan communities,” president of the Inter Greek Council (IGC) and member of Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) Jason Brandner ’16 said. “We want to celebrate fall and allow children to have a safe space and a fun time [on campus].” According to the Coordinator of Greek Life, Zack Pfeifer, the idea for the Fall Harvest Festival came about during the spring of this year. Students involved in Greek life discussed their desire to host one or two large community outreach events in order to gain recognition for their community and the mission of Greek life. “In particular, they wanted to try and reach out to the Middletown larger community, to provide some outreach to the community that has traditionally been ostracized by some of the actions that Greek life has done on campus in the past,” Pfeifer said. “We wanted to reach out to them and give them this opportunity to come back and enjoy some games, athletics, and to play some family-friendly activities.” The six Greek societies that were present at the festival were AEPi, Alpha Delta Phi, Chi Psi, Psi Upsilon (Psi U), Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE), and Rho Epsilon Pi (Rho Ep). The Eclectic Society registered for the event but was absent, so its booth was run by other students in the community. “We figured each society could run one different booth of this festival, and that way everyone could kind of share responsibility and come up with their own games with their own style,” Psi U member and IGC Community Engagement Chair Abby Reed ’16 said. “But really, we’d all be working together so that kids could meet a big range of college students.” This festival is not just a collaboration between the University’s Greek life community. Reed said that they branched out by asking local businesses to join them. “[We] actually got a dentist to come,” Reed said. “We figured since we’re giving out candy and it’s Halloween we might as well have comprehensive health discussions.” The festival consisted of more than just booths and games. Additionally, the Greek community collected a large number of canned goods for the Office of Community Engagement’s Canned Goods Drive. “It’s going pretty well,” Brandner said. “We’ve got a fair amount of kids here. Everyone seems just to be having a great time. It’s putting together a kind of community service and community engagement [event]. It’s like having a fun time and doing Greek the Wes way.” This event is the first of many community engagement events the Greek community would like to organize this semester, in an effort to express its gratitude for, and be more involved in the community. “I personally would love to do it next year,” said Rho Ep member Hannah Skopicki ’18. “I’m just having the time of my life, and I’m really, really enjoying myself. It’s really nice for us to get to know more of the people in Middletown and for them to get to know us, and who we are.” Reed said the one improvement that could have been made to the festival was the way it was advertised. “Our downfall is we only started advertising for it a month ago,” Reed said. “So in future events, we’ll definitely want to advertise a lot more in advance. However, it’s our first time doing it, so by making this an inaugural event we’re hoping that each fall it’s something that Middletown can look forward to.” The festival was geared towards young children and families. Jessica Bisson traveled from Colby to see the football game. While attending the game, she also brought her children to the festival. “It was unexpected,” Bisson said. “We just traveled here from Maine for the football game. The kids really seem to be enjoying it, and it was a good way to break up the game for them. Face painting is always a hit.” The Fall Harvest Festival was more than a community engagement project for the University’s Greek community. “The focus isn’t really on Greek life,” Reed said. “It’s more just on interacting with kids and having fun.” This article has been edited to reflect that DKE was present at the event."
"Green Fund Backs Sustainability","2015-10-15","by Jess Zalph, Features Editor","The Green Fund wants to make students' environmental dreams—both large and small—come true.This November, the University’s Green Fund Committee will launch a new campaign to raise awareness for its microgrant project, allowing students and faculty to turn their environmental dreams for campus into a reality. This campaign will be kicked off with the launch of a promotional video highlighting the extent to which students are unfamiliar with the Green Fund’s potential. “The Green Fund is an important vehicle we have for supporting sustainable initiatives on campus,” said President Michael Roth in the promotional video. “It allows us to increase our sustainability, decrease our dependence on fossil fuels, and become a better place.” The Green Fund, founded in 2010, is supported by the $15 “opt-out” fee that students pay at the start of each semester. This past school year, the Green Fund got approved by the Board of Trustees for another five-year period, and the Fund currently has $85,000 to spend on environmental initiatives. Historically, the largest grants have supported Wild Wes and Long Lane Farm, funding student internships along with other initiatives. The Fund has also supported the Beekeeping Club, the Bike Co-Op, and Middletown Urban Gardens, among other projects; and with this campaign, the Green Fund is hoping to inspire a greater variety of proposals. “I would love to see a lot of people applying, and a lot of different kinds of projects,” said Sustainability Director Jen Kleindienst. “It’s always exciting to see new proposals come in, especially when they’re really creative ideas.” The first goal of this campaign is to make the Wesleyan community aware that the Green Fund exists, and that it is accessible to all. “A lot of students probably have ideas and just don’t know that this is out there and that this is an opportunity,” Kleindienst said. The promotional video emphasizes this idea, showing, Jimmy Fallon-style, students’ lack of awareness of a program on which most voluntarily spent 30 dollars each year. A second goal is to attract a creative and diverse set of proposals from a diverse population. “Environmental activism at Wes is often too narrowly defined, both in terms of who is involved and the kinds of projects students are working on,” wrote Keren Reichler ’16, co-chair of the Green Fund, in an email to The Argus. “We believe that in order to effectively address the complexity of environmental issues today, we must think much more creatively and inclusively about environmental action and change.” Not only are they hoping for a variety of proposals, but they are hoping to get them from a diverse group of applicants. “[One] aim is to spread awareness that you don’t have to fit a stereotype of an environmentalist to benefit from the fund,” said Cassia Patel ’17, accountant for The Green Fund. “We want everyone to be able to benefit.” Kleindienst stressed that the program is open to faculty and staff as well as students. “A lot of people think, ‘Oh, it’s a student fund, so it’s just for students,’ but really it’s for the whole campus, and we’ve had some good ideas out of it,” she said. In addition to promoting awareness and a diverse range of applications, members of the Green Fund have a third goal: to encourage small proposals. “There…seems to be a misconception on campus that the Green Fund only funds large-scale projects,” Reichler wrote. “We’re emphasizing the small grant option to encourage smaller-scale projects and to increase student engagement.” Patel noted that one past small proposal, costing $60, was to place “These Come From Trees” stickers on paper towel dispensers. Looking forward, she posited suggestions for reusable water bottles for sports teams, or changes to WesStation to increase its sustainability. Although there are many environmental groups on campus, the Green Fund sees itself as holding a unique position on the University’s campus. For one, it is both campus-centric and student-centric. “It’s by students, for students,” Patel said. “It’s student money, organized by students, and given out to students.” The Fund also provides support for initiatives that would otherwise be challenging to accomplish at the University. “There are a lot of great things that students can do on campus, but they’re not necessarily cost effective,” she said. Kleindienst provided Long Lane as an example of such a project, saying it has done amazing things, but has no financial return to appeal to the administration. “This provided an opportunity to have funding for things from the smallest project to a really large project, without that same financial weight,” she said. She added that, while a financial return is ideal, it is in no way a requirement. The Green Fund is also unique in the amount of money it controls and in the transformative effect it has played in sustainability at the University. The Office of Sustainability itself originated as a product of Green Fund money, and this office has since grown to support many campus-wide initiatives, such as the Eco Facilitators program, which employs peer “sustainability educators” in all dorms and throughout campus, hosting a variety of events. Members of the Green Fund also hope to promote cohesiveness and communication within the student body. “My goal with the Green Fund is to unify the environmental movements on campus,” Patel said. “There are so many polar opposites. People who are protesting the system, people who are working within the system, people who are all the way up at Long Lane…. The Green Fund knows about most of the projects on campus and can be a way to unify people.” Patel added that her personal goals for the Green Fund go beyond specific sustainability causes. “Another project that I want to make sure happens this year is some sort of social gathering for environmental people, to get people together talking and sharing ideas,” she said. The Green Fund Committee is eagerly anticipating its new outreach program, and proposals for microgrants can be submitted through its website. “We’re excited to see the innovative project proposals that students will submit,” Reichler wrote. “And we’re hoping to see a wide range of groups apply for funding to address a wide range of issues.”"
"Kim ’02 Leads Crowdfunding Bootcamp","2015-10-22","by Molly Schiff, News Editor","Hyungsoo Kim ’02 returned to campus to share his experiences launching a successful Kickstarter Campaign. Molly Schiff, News Editor With the rise of crowdfunding websites such as KickStarter and Indiegogo, it may seem easier than ever to start a new enterprise. However, this is not the case; launching a successful crowdfunding campaign requires careful consideration and a lot of strategy. Hyungsoo Kim ’02, entrepreneur and creator of the Bradley Timepiece, returned to campus on Thursday, Oct. 22 to share the dos and don’ts of successful online fundraising. As part of the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship’s (PCSE) Fall Workshop series, Kim discussed the steps required to create, market, and effectively crowdfund a new product. He began by addressing how the advent of crowdfunding sites has transformed how entrepreneurs can raise funds for the initial phases of their product or services without having to give up too much of their company to investors or rely on family members. “Even three years ago, there was no such thing [as a crowdfunding website],” Kim said.  “You would have a really great idea, but no way of raising money, so there was no way to start anything if you didn’t have money, or your parents or family didn’t have money. So, the crowdfunding campaign had a huge impact on a lot of startup companies as well as people who run social campaigns.” As opposed to the traditional investment model, where one develops a product with financing from investors—to whom one generally gives a large stake of their companies in exchange—the crowdfunding process maintains the entrepreneur’s independence by reversing the process by which a product or service comes into existence. “Now, [when] you have the prototype, and then you post it on Kickstarter, and then all of the marketing…is free, basically,” Kim said. “Five percent of the money you raise, you pay to Kickstarter, but it’s not that much. And, if you don’t make any money, you don’t pay.” Kim then used his own product as a model, detailing the way in which he successfully crowdsourced the initial phases producing the Bradley Timepiece, a watch that allows wearers to tell the time through the senses of sight and touch. The project was inspired the discontent expressed by one of his classmates at the MIT Sloan School of Management where he earned his MBA, who was blind and could not find a watch that was both stylish and functional. Though talking watches and watches with open faces were available, the former was disruptive and the latter rather useless, as the hands would easily be shifted. “I was really surprised that there was nothing else,” he said. “There should be something else.” So, with a team of engineers and designers, Kim created the Bradley Timepiece and embarked on the process of marketing, crowdfunding, and selling it. He stressed the importance of generating buzz around a product before launching a Kickstarter campaign, as the first few days that it is can make or break its success. Kim and his team did this by making a video as well as social media pages. Generally, Kim noted that the most effective advertisements for mainstream products were those focused on the design of a product and were generally about a minute and a half long. However, his video, featuring the story of Brad Snyder, veteran and Paralympic champion who lost his sight while on active duty in Afghanistan clocks in at about six minutes. Katya Sapozhnina ’16, founder and president of the Wesleyan Entrepreneurship Society, asked Kim about his risky decision to create such a long video that advertised the product from a personal angle. “I wanted to ask about the video and why you chose to focus on the personal story of someone who is blind versus the cool design aspects,” Sapozhnina said. Kim responded that he took such a risk because he felt the story was compelling (so much so that he named the watch after Snyder) and would achieve one of Snyder’s goals of bridging the gap between the blind and the sighted. “We wanted to connect people, those who are visually impaired and those who are sighted,” Kim said. “We wanted to break down the wall between them.” Additionally, Kim reached out to many bloggers in order to begin circulating information about the product and impending Kickstarter campaign. In total, he got media attention from about a dozen different sources prior to the page’s launching. All of this preparation work led to a strong start, which put him on the front page of the website for four days. That exposure, gained either by popularity or staff picks, is what can make or break a project’s crowdfunding campaign. He also made note of the modest goal he posted on the site : $40 thousand. “Our internal goal was $80 thousand,” Kim said. “But we put $40 thousand because if you don’t reach your goal, you don’t get any [of the donated funds].” Employing these strategies, Kim was able to raise approximately $500 thousand in the 30-day period during which the page was live. Sapozhnina found the presentation informative and encouraging. “I think crowdfunding is wonderful because it makes being an entrepreneur more accessible,” she said. “We can now use very little money while raising thousands, even before making the product.” Jennifer Roach ’14, Civic Engagement Fellow for the Center of Community Partnerships, noted the universality and applicability of Kim’s work to students’ work at the University and beyond. “Whatever project they end up doing, whatever organizations or business they end up starting, crowdfunding is one of those tools that might be useful to a lot of students working on any number of projects,” said Roach. “It’s applicable if you’re doing nonprofit work, if you’re at an educational institution…it can even be used for a political campaign. It’s very cool to be able to have [the opportunity], any time that you get a chance to learn from someone who has started their own business, who has done something that you’re interested in after graduation, whether or not you’re interested in crowdfunding.” For all students, there is a lesson to be learned from someone who has been there before. “You never know what you’re going to get out of one of these workshops,” Roach said."
"Title IX Open Forum Discusses Policy Changes","2015-11-04","by Eliana Blum, Staff Writer","On Nov. 1, the Title IX Student Advisory Committee and the WSA hosted an open forum to discuss new initiatives.The Title IX Student Advisory Committee and the WSA hosted an open forum to discuss the Title IX policy changes that have been enforced over the past school year. Students were encouraged to attend the Sunday, Nov. 1 meeting and pose questions or comments to the University’s Title IX Policy Committee. The meeting started off by addressing the policy and education updates, and then it moved on to collect student feedback about the education initiatives and possible ways to execute no-contact order violations on campus. The feedback from this forum will be used to inform future Title IX policy and education changes for the upcoming year. Some of these changes include student facilitators, no contact orders, group training sessions, and online videos about sexual consent. “We’re continually trying to improve the education around Title IX on campus,” wrote Claire Wright ’16, student chair on the Title IX Policy Committee and co-chair of the Title IX Student Advisory Committee, in an email to The Argus. “This is an ongoing conversation and we continually need feedback to improve our campus.” Title IX is a federal law that bans discrimination on the basis of sex at all federally funded educational institutions. Sexual violence is covered under Title IX, and in order for institutions to continue to receive federal funding, they must meet certain requirements. Nikita Rajgopal ’17, co-chair of the Title IX Student Advisory Committee and tri-chair of the Title IX Education Committee, addressed the importance of these meetings. “Sexual violence prevention is an ongoing process, and it’s important for Wesleyan to continue to update their policies and educational programming to go beyond simply the baseline requirements,” Rajgopal wrote in an email to The Argus. “Having an ongoing conversation between students and the administration is essential to bettering Wesleyan’s policy and working on preventing sexual violence on campus.” It is not only the Title IX coordinators who promote conversation about sexual violence on campus. The WSA co-hosted this forum and plays an active role in spreading awareness about the importance of the issue. “I have had a unique look into the policy world of the extremely pervasive and deeply personal issue of sexual violence at Wesleyan,” wrote WSA President Kate Cullen ’16 in an email to The Argus. “I have found that compared to our peer schools, our administration is hitting more legal benchmarks. However, while on paper we look okay, I have seen first-hand how the Wesleyan system continues to fail students who should be protected under Title IX.” In an effort to comply with the Title IX regulations, the University offers education and prevention programs for all students on campus. Additionally, forums such as this one occur throughout the year in order to address all questions students may have. “Last year we held a similar event where the feedback that we collected was really vital to the policy changes that were made, so we wanted to work off that model,” Rajgopal wrote. “I want students to feel like they have a voice in what Wesleyan’s policy is and what educational programming we do.  It’s important that the work that we are doing is relevant to students on campus so I hope students who attend feel like they can continue these conversations with us.” Another forum was held on Nov. 4 to discuss Title IX in detail. This meeting, led by Equity Compliance Director, Deputy Title IX Coordinator Debbi Colucci, also served to answer any lingering questions that the student body had. “I hope that people will leave with a clearer understanding of title IX policy and education initiatives at Wesleyan,” Wright wrote. “Furthermore, I hope people understand that their feedback within this forum will guide Wesleyan’s future. We are holding this forum because student feedback will inform Wesleyan’s future.” These meetings have become much more frequent this year to make up for the lack of discussion in previous years. Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias noted the University’s need to expand its services. “In the past we haven’t proactively engaged the campus through a variety of info sessions the way we are this year,” Farias wrote in an email to The Argus. “From here on, the norm will be more proactive engagement with various elements of the campus community so that we are better able to take a barometer reading on what’s working and what isn’t.” Awareness continues to grow as more student groups become involved with the Title IX conversation. Cullen, however, questions just how close the University is to mending this issue once and for all. “I’m happy the WSA helped co-host a Town Hall and I’m excited to announce that we now have a Title IX Working Group to provide support and collaboration space for students already working on the issue,” Cullen wrote. “Our ability as a community to talk about sexual violence has improved [in] the last few years, however, we have a long way to go to eliminate rape culture and create a fair Title IX judicial process.” Farias sees this issue as being one step beyond gender equality. In his eyes, Title IX is a matter of respect. “Wesleyan is about more than just compliance, it’s a unique living-learning laboratory where we must think and do in ways that speak to the fundamental core value of respect—as individuals and as an institution,” he wrote. “Regardless of where we come from, Wesleyan is the place where we must learn and act out of respect for others, for difference in all its forms.  If we get that right, your education will be priceless.”"
"WSA Approves Legislative Pathway for Student Petitions","2015-11-12","by Molly Schiff, News Editor","Resolution 4.37, passed at the Nov. 7 Senate Meeting, aims to increase transparency and participation in the WSA's legislative process. In an effort to improve its representation of the student body, the Wesleyan Student Assembly Senate passed new legislation on Sunday, Nov. 8 that will enhance students’ abilities to directly influence the legislation that make it onto each meeting’s agenda. Resolution 4.37 will set up new protocol for students to introduce resolutions directly to the Senate. It passed by a measure of 23-0, with four votes abstaining. Previously, students interested in introducing legislation—such as petitions that have gained popular support through signatures—had to find an elected WSA member to sponsor the bill and present it on their behalves. The resolution acknowledges this situation, amending section 5.05 of its bylaws to provide a mechanism by which these students can directly submit their proposals to the WSA. WSA Senate member Jacob Maiman-Stadtmauer ’19 introduced the resolution as a way to provide a pathway for the often-confusing process. He feels that this will provide a measure of transparency to the WSA’s legislative processes. “Personally, I’m really excited about this resolution because it makes the WSA more transparent and democratic,” Maiman-Stadmauer wrote in an email to The Argus. “Through crystallizing and publishing the process for the WSA responding to resolutions we’ve been able to make the Assembly that much more transparent. Additionally, through allowing the larger student body to directly propose solutions to problems or bring new problems to light through resolutions, we’ve been able to make the WSA more democratic.” Student-introduced resolutions must meet a set of eligibility requirements in order to be considered. First, all pieces of proposed legislation must be formatted in the same way as all Senate member-introduced resolutions. Students who have trouble meeting this requirement are encouraged to meet with the Chief of Staff in order to ensure their proposal is properly written. Current Chief of Staff John Henry Vansant ’18 elaborated on the role he will play in drafting legislation. “As the Resolution specifies, my role as the Chief of Staff will be to facilitate this effort by assisting ‘the author/s of the proposal to change it into appropriate form,’” Vansant wrote in an email to The Argus. “Since the WSA votes on resolutions, petitions need to be translated into resolution form. The Chief of Staff’s role is then to alleviate this burden of having to format a petition by helping students out with the editing. The WSA recognizes that procedures should not inhibit student voices from being heard, so my role as Chief of Staff is to make sure that petitions will be introduced and discussed without any setbacks.” Second, each resolution must obtain a minimum number of student signatures, determined by voter turnout and subject to change from year to year. “[The] number of signatures required will be set equal to the number of votes that the elected Wesleyan Student Assembly member who was elected with the least number of votes garnered,” Resolution 4.37 reads. While this process may appear overly intricate, Maiman-Stadmauer explained that this particular requirement was determined in the interest of democracy. “This formula may seem complicated, but we felt that if a student could be given the full privileges of any senator with a given number of votes, there’s no reason that students shouldn’t be able to introduce resolutions with a number of supporters equal to that,” he wrote. Students whose proposals meet the standards outlined by the document will also be responsible for presenting their resolutions to members of the WSA. This increased level of direct student non-member participation in the WSA legislative process was instituted with the overall goals of the WSA in mind. “Through allowing the larger student body to directly propose solutions to problems or bring new problems to light through resolutions, we’ve been able to make the WSA more democratic,” wrote Maidman-Stadmauer. “This resolution will also make the WSA more democratic by allowing the larger student body to have a direct and formal say in the WSA through more than just the [biannual] elections. This resolution builds on the recent steps in the last year or so towards becoming more democratic, transparent, and responsive to the student body.” WSA President Kate Cullen ’16 looks forward to seeing the positive impact this resolution intends have on the University. “I commend Jacob for bringing this resolution forward and pushing all of us on the WSA to think more critically about our commitment to transparency, accountability, and greater civic engagement,” said Cullen in an email to The Argus. “This new resolution well exemplifies those values and I am excited to see what opportunities it will bring for open discourse.”"
"Keynote Speakers Share at Social Impact Summit","2015-11-16","by Molly Schiff, News Editor","The Social Impact Summit brought together alumni for a weekend of workshops and discussion.The University continued its long history of social engagement this past weekend, as distinguished alumni, select students, and local leaders flocked to campus for the first-ever Social Impact Summit. The Summit, sponsored by the Shasha Seminar for Human Concerns, kicked off on the evening of Friday, Nov. 13 with four keynote addresses, followed by a period of snacks and networking. The speakers, all University alumni, each gave a 10-minute presentation. They focused on their work in their respective fields and also provided their visions for social change. Three leaders of the University’s centers for social change introduced the speakers. Rob Rosenthal, Director of the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life and John E. Andrus, Professor of Sociology, took the stage first. “There’s a long and glorious history of students and staff and faculty and alums doing this sort of social impact work,” Rosenthal said. “What’s changed over the last decade or so at Wesleyan is that we have begun to really institutionally support that kind of work…. And having made so much progress on campus in this direction, we’ve been thinking about how to extend it, how to bring together many alumni doing social impact work… members of the ‘Wesleyan Do-Gooder Mafia,’ as some might say.” The first presenter, Kirk Adams ’73, P’13, spent the last 40 years of his career advocating for the rights of healthcare workers and unions. He currently serves as the International Executive Vice President of the Service Employees International Union, where he focuses specifically on healthcare. Adams is also married to Cecile Richards, President of Planned Parenthood Federation of America and Planned Parenthood Action Fund. He joked that the only reason he, a white, 65-year-old man, was invited to speak was that she might come with him. The majority of his speech was dedicated to his visions for the future. As a political activist, he focused his attention toward the next generation of voters and their capacity for impacting social change. “A lot has been written about the youth,” Adams said. “I just wanted to focus on one particular issue, which is the issue of voting and where you sit in that whole process.” He explained that the millennial generation outnumbers the baby boomers, is at the heart of many political issues being debated today, and is the most diverse generation to reach voting age in the United States. However, that has not necessarily translated to the voting booth. “First of all, you’re not as monolithic as you’re made out to be,” Adams said. “[In 2012] 60 percent of this generation who voted, voted for President Obama. Of that, only 44 percent of white millennials voted for Obama…. But really, the biggest defining issue is whether you voted at all.” In order to bring this number up to its fullest potential, Adams advocates automatic voter registration and potentially online voting as two of the big changes he’d like to see in the future. The next speaker, Irma Gonzalez ’78, P’09 is an activist and Principal at Zoen Resources, which works on the forefront of domestic human rights advocacy. Makaela Kingsley ’98, Director of The Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, described Gonzalez as steadfastly committed to the University. In 2008, Gonzalez was the recipient of the Wesleyan University Service Award. She began her address by recounting the gender inequality she experienced as a child growing up first in Cuba and then in the U.S., where she also experienced exclusion for her ethnicity and status as an immigrant. These early experiences fueled her passion and informed the work that she does today. “It was really clear that the advantages of white skin really mattered,” Gonzalez said. “These advantages were sources of outrage. I can’t tell you how many times I have heard people say truly offensive, disgraceful things, assuming that they knew me, my allegiances, my values, because of the color of my skin.” She hopes to see a world where data-driven solutions match the goals that are created on the ground, with local citizens serving as experts and consultants. “That’s the technology revolution I want to dance in,” Gonzalez said. Her addressing the value of community-driven social change served as a fitting segue to the last two speakers, Kennedy Odede ’12 and Jessica Posner-Odede ’09, co-founders of Shining Hope for Communities Organization (SHOFCO) and spouses. Odede grew up in Kibera, a slum located near Nairobi, Kenya, and through SHOFCO, has worked, along with Posner-Odede, to educate young girls and combat poverty in urban slums. Odede explained the purpose of SHOFCO, as well as his personal motivations. “It’s about fixing things,” he said. “You see a challenge, and how do you fix it?… You also have to have a drive; something has to drive us. It’s not about money, it’s about fixing something.” Odede then discussed the value of hope and collaboration in a vision for change. “I think hope is very, very important,” he said. “Hope isn’t only for poor people, but hope is good for everybody… You can’t do something alone. It’s all about teamwork.” For him, the critical partner in this operation was Posner-Odede, who visited Kibera for the first time while studying abroad in Kenya. She and Odede have developed the organization together, which today provides education, community resources, and critical infrastructure for girls and families in both Kibera and Mathare, Kenya. “It won’t happen overnight, it takes time, but… we’ve seen those girls’ lives improve, their health improve, their families’ livelihood; we’ve seen the ripple effect of investing in a girl,” Posner-Odede said. “This is the change that it is so powerful to be a part of.” Following the presentation, attendees were invited to chat over snacks in Zelnick Pavilion before registered guests began the dinner and weekend workshops of the Summit. “We know there is power in bringing together Wesleyan people,” Kingsley wrote in an email to The Argus. “We hope to be able to offer it again in the future. Based on early feedback I have heard from attendees, there is great demand to do it again.”"
"Douglas Cannon Society, Demystified","2015-11-16","by Emma Davis, Rajaa Elidrissi, Staff Writer & Community Editor","The Argus examines the secret society with custody of the infamous cannon.The University is host to a number of not-so-secret societies, including Skull and Serpent, Mystical Seven, and Theta Nu Epsilon. Perhaps the most mysterious is the Douglas Cannon Society, known only for its association with the lone campus cannon. The Cannon Society has taken responsibility for multiple sightings of the Douglas Cannon, a brass cannon at the heart of one of the University’s longest-running pranks. The cannon itself is a relic from the mid-19th century, when the University was in session during the Fourth of July and celebrated the holiday with a student-led volley of cannon fire. After the academic calendar changed in 1859, the University incorporated the campus cannons into annual festivities for George Washington’s birthday. An intense interclass rivalry developed between the first-years, who were assigned to fire the cannons on the morning of Feb. 22, and the sophomores, who tried to thwart the first-years’ efforts. The clashes evolved into a tradition known as “cannon scraps,” which became so extreme that by 1916 the student body voted to discontinue the use of the cannons. During the 1867 cannon scrap, the Douglas Cannon was borrowed from a local artillery regiment named after former Middletown mayor Benjamin Douglas. The cannon was given to the University as a gift at the turn of the century, and in 1931, it was filled with lead and installed in what was intended as its final resting place on campus. But 26 years later, a mischievous group of students hacked the cannon away from its pedestal and began placing it in locations around the world. The cannon has traveled to New York, Iowa, Washington, D.C., London, Paris, and Venezuela and was almost part of a delegation to the U.S.S.R., according to the University’s blog and an online exhibit from Olin Library’s Special Collections and Archives. The cannon has also materialized at several University-sponsored events. In 1981, the cannon was baked into the University’s sesquicentennial birthday cake, and in 2007, it made a brief appearance during President Michael Roth’s inauguration reception. In 2012, former Argus editor-in-chief Claire Bradach ’15 speculated that the cannon had come under University control. Previously, during the 1960s, a group called “Cannon Retrievers United South of Heaven” (CRUSH) had claimed to be the cannon’s handlers, sending letters to The Argus detailing its whereabouts. In 2000, a group called  “Cannon Liberators Aiming West” (CLAW) took over the role. The two organizations may have been precursors of the current Douglas Cannon Society, which has also reached out to The Argus about the cannon’s location (and recently began communicating with wesleying). Last spring, the Society shared what appears to be a photo of its members, their faces covered by black hoods. Unlike members of other secret societies, who reveal themselves by wearing pins on their gowns during graduation, members of the Cannon Society never disclose their identities. Today’s Cannon Society has approximately 10 members, making it the smallest secret society on campus, an anonymous source explained. “The fewer members, the fewer people know we exist,” the source said. According to a second source within the group, the Cannon Society is a senior secret society, with new members initiated during their junior year. Initiations are normally held in the spring, but there might be a second initiation if a selected member is abroad during that semester. Aside from its guardianship of the Douglas Cannon, the Society’s purpose is unclear, leaving some students to wonder whether it functions as much more than a social network. However, the Cannon Society seems to have had an affiliation with WesUnity, a now-defunct student group. While active, WesUnity was a “student-run organization which maintained a compendium of links and news relating to activism on the campus of Wesleyan University as well as links to national and local resources,” according to WSA archives. Vice President of Student Affairs Michael Whaley hinted at the connection between the two groups in an email to The Argus, describing the mission of the Cannon Society as highly similar to that of WesUnity. “The members [of the Douglas Cannon Society] are dedicated to discussing campus issues and building bridges on campus to promote unity and enhance the sense of community,” Whaley wrote. Yet WesUnity is best known for hosting concerts, such as Girl Talk in 2008 and Matisyahu and Chiddy Bang in 2011. The latter was announced to campus in an email titled “Douglas Cannon” and prompted so much controversy over its funding—$55,000 allotted to WesUnity anonymously—that the WSA’s Concert Committee was forced to reevaluate its bylaws. In 2013, WesUnity created a Twitter account with the description “DUGG LESS CAN NAAN.” That same year, the group hosted “Chalk de Franzia,” an event to protest the University’s bans on the Tour de Franzia and chalking on campus. But when asked about the link between WesUnity and the Douglas Cannon Society, the sources declined to comment. Likewise, the current WSA, despite having provided funding to WesUnity in the past, denies any involvement with the Cannon Society. “Neither the WSA nor the SBC at large funds or [has] any knowledge of funding the Cannon Society,” said WSA Office Manager Arpita Vora ’16. “I don’t think we fund any secret societies, actually.” Current Student Budget Committee (SBC) Chair Evelysse Vargas ’17 concurred. “The SBC doesn’t knowingly fund the operational costs of exclusive societies, [which] includes secret societies,” Vargas wrote in a message to The Argus. “[But] I can’t speak to any funding before 2013, when OrgSync was first instituted.” So who are the Douglas Cannon’s elusive custodians? What will they cook up next? And whose money will they use? These are questions that only the Society can answer."
"Students Hold Vigil for Peace at International House","2015-11-19","by Alicia Strong, Staff Writer","In the wake of terror attacks in Baghdad, Beirut, and Paris, students joined together in Exley to mourn the lives lost and express their feelings. On Tuesday, Nov. 16, International House hosted its “Vigil for Peace” event in Exley Science Center. The vigil was planned in response to the recent attacks in Paris, Beirut, and Baghdad. The residents of International House invited all members of the University community to join together in solidarity. They hoped to create a safe space for people to remember the lives lost as well as express hope for a better future. The vigil began with a brief introduction followed by a moment of silence. Then the organizers opened up the floor for attendees to share their thoughts and feelings. Many students expressed deep remorse over all of the lives lost. After the vigil, the organizers shared their thoughts about the need to create this environment for students. Yael Horowitz ’17 explained her reasons for planning the vigil. “I thought it was important to acknowledge everything that was going on in the world other than just Paris,” Horowitz said. She then explained why the vigil took place in International House specifically, drawing attention to the systematic nature of violence. “I thought it was important that it came from International House so that we could have an international lens on it, that wasn’t just focused on specific countries or specific identities but more about much larger systems of violence,” Horowitz said. “Noticing the extremely violent situations that are happening but situating those within a much more painful and much more constant reality.” Jhanelle Thomas ’18 expressed frustration about the selective mourning that often occurs when discussing violence. In the wake of the Paris attacks, which received more media attention than the attacks in Beirut and Baghdad did, many called for increased recognition of terror outside of the Western world. “It’s really frustrating to see all of the focus be on one specific country, especially when things like this go on in all of these different countries all the time and no one really talks about it,” she said. Dache Rogers ’18 talked about the erasure that occurs when people choose to selectively mourn. “I think it’s easy to see these things happening and become desensitized to it… and that the people who lost their lives are just faceless people; they’re just another number,” Rogers said. Thomas also brought attention to the problematic way social media has perpetuated selective mourning in society. “Facebook has like, the filter and it’s of the flag of France but never for Kenya, never for any other country, and that’s really frustrating to see,” Thomas said. Rogers conveyed what she believed was the main goal of creating this place for students. “I think that this vigil was really aimed to get every one together who was affected by this… and have a safe space where they can just share their feelings… and hear from other people’s perspectives,” she said. All of the organizers agreed that the moment of silence was an important and essential part of the vigil. Horowitz elaborated by discussing the power of silence. “I think moments of silence are really powerful when you’re able to get a big group of people together to be silent out of respect or out of grief,” she said. The organizers were especially glad that students chose to speak at the event. Horowitz indicated her satisfaction with the level of participation. “I was amazed by the bravery and the genius of a lot of the people who spoke,” she said. “I think that these events only work if the participants really bring themselves to the conversation. I think that really happened.” Rogers emphasized her gratitude for students’ engagement in the event. “I was very proud of everybody that spoke… they reflected thoughts I’ve had by myself but didn’t really want to say,” Rogers said. Horowitz’s tone while discussing the event was hopeful. “I don’t know if it’s going to change anything, but maybe something one person said is going to affect the life of another person,” Horowitz said. Thomas was particularly affected by a student’s remark about the common nature of ignorance. “One of the responses that really stuck with me was this one girl who was talking about being desensitized,” she said. “What are we doing about [global terror]? We need to do something about it.”"
"Students Engage with Trauma Institutionally, Artistically","2015-12-07","by Jake Lahut, Staff Writer","The Title IX Office and WeSlam offer two divergent ways of dealing with trauma on campus. Despite being called “coddled” by many baby-boomers and even some in our own generation, millennials do in fact confront trauma on campus, sometimes in droves. From experiencing the rigidity of reporting traumatic events to the administration to witnessing the visible vulnerability of delivering a slam poem, University students interact with trauma almost constantly. The Institution  At the level of the institution, the University has a Freudian intellectual historian as its president. University President Michael Roth believes that academia provides space for dealing with trauma for both students and professors. “I think that some of the most important occasions for learning occur when students and teachers work through events that have been traumatic either for others or for themselves, and having a visceral sense as well as cognitive or intellectual sense of the horrors of certain kinds of experiences, I think, is a really important part of learning,” President Roth said. In a new era of trigger warnings, Roth also addressed the pain that comes with confronting trauma in the academic arena. “It also can be a painful part of learning,” Roth said. “But if one avoids [confronting trauma], you avoid the some of the essential aspects of history and also of contemporary experience.” One of the most difficult aspects of trauma that Roth presents in his book “Memory, Trauma, and History: Essays on Living with the Past” is the fact that trauma can make such a mark in someone’s life that after it happens, it can be incredibly difficult to learn from because of the pain it caused at the time and continues to cause in the present. “On the other hand, you can’t really learn from something when it’s so painful that it’s overwhelming,” Roth said. “So I think it’s the responsibility of an institution to help students put extreme negative events into a context where they can be learned from, not just suffered from.… I think avoiding traumatic occurrences would be to avoid some of the core elements of education.” Institutionally, trauma appears in the Title IX Office, headed by Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias. Although Title IX is most widely known as a federal mandate for gender equity on college campuses, such as an equal number of men’s and women’s varsity athletics teams, the legal doctrines behind Title IX have been used more recently to combat sexual assault on college campuses. Therefore, it is crucial that staff members of the University’s Title IX Office have an ability to  deal with the trauma that students may face. For Farias, a major part of this is the trauma training that he and his staff undergo. “Everyone who works with the portion of Title IX related to harassment and sexual assault—investigators, hearing panelists, counselors, and administrators—receives in-depth and on-going training in trauma response,” Farias wrote in an email to The Argus. “We purposefully partner with survivor support community agencies for elements of our training in order to make sure we are doing more than just saying we’re trauma-informed in our engagement with survivors. We have enough redundancy in the system that reporting parties have multiple options as to investigators, counselors and administrators helping them through what is at best a difficult process.” One important aspect of trauma training for Farias is that, although they are employed at a university, members of his team effectively serve as service providers to students. Another important aspect of trauma training is that it allows University administrators to constantly improve upon how they help survivors, especially when films like “The Hunting Ground” reveal that the language used by administrators during the reporting of sexual assault is often insensitive and far from empathetic to the trauma survivors experience. “This training translates into a number of practical applications, including policy, procedure, practice, and even individual language,” Farias wrote. “How we as individuals show up varies as much as our personalities and backgrounds. So the on-going training is important as it allows us, as service providers, to continuously learn what we’re doing right and more importantly, what’s not working—from policy to individual interactions. There is, however, no one-size-fits-all response; it is important to understand that trauma is individual and we make decisions in the best interest of the person with whom we are working.” Farias also said that his most vocal critics express how important it is that Farias learns and continues doing his job. “As the Title IX Officer, I’ll be the first to admit I’ve learned a great deal through my interactions with student activists and it pains me to think I may not have done enough, not listened with an empathic enough ear, which is why I’m grateful to the tireless staff, faculty, students working on the Title IX committees, because we are collectively learning through dialogue and deep listening, both of which require continual tuning and special attention to our staunchest critics, who have the most to teach us,” Farias wrote. The Stage  Dealing with trauma is often a very private affair for students, which is necessary in the stressful life of students in college and especially those at an elite school. One of the most visible places where students confront trauma, however, is through the spoken word medium of slam poetry. “I generally think that spoken word is the most vulnerable medium of writing, because you’re not hiding behind a character, or fiction, or even the page,” said Hazem Fahmy ’17, a poet for WeSlam, the University’s slam poetry team. “You are there, and [the audience members] are seeing you do your thing, and unleash all of your emotions.” Giorgia Peckman, who currently serves as Chair of WeSLAM but underscored that she does not speak for WeSLAM nor the poetry and writing community of the University in general, believes that poetry can be a powerful way for anyone to deal with trauma. “I think that in not just WeSLAM, but poetry in general, gives a way to interact with [trauma] very intimately but also a way to distance yourself from it in some ways,” Peckman said. “Poetry often creates a safe space in which to interact with your trauma and deal with it, and then once the poem’s over you can re-compartmentalize and do the rest of your life.” The space in which slam poetry occurs is important for both Fahmy and Peckman because it creates an environment in which trauma can be confronted by both the speaker and the audience. Snapping fingers are the most obvious sign of the solidarity that people feel during poetry slams. In talking about the safe space that poetry slams provide, Peckman noted that the world outside of poetry slams is not safe, which is why it can be so cathartic to deliver a traumatic experience through spoken word and then hear snaps from the audience members who can relate to that experience. Fahmy elaborated on what makes slam poetry a great arena for confronting trauma. “There are two main things I would be thinking about when I think of a good slam space,” Fahmy said. “First of all, that level of respect that [Peckman] was just talking about, where, as an audience member, you’re not going to come out of [a poetry slam] and be like, ‘Oh, well Jake just talked about this really difficult thing,’ and you understand that even though the poet is sort of laying all of this down for you, it’s not for you, it’s for them. It’s not for you to do with it as you please. It’s a space that’s aware of that and it’s there for people to empathize and grow and make connections with other people.”"
"Event Series to Commemorate Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Promote Environmental Justice","2016-01-26","by Erica DeMichiel, News Editor","In honor of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, the Office of Equity and Inclusion teamed up with members of the Green Fund to organize an event series with a focus on environmental justice. The four-part series will provide further context for and build up to Dr. Dorceta Taylor’s keynote address, “Different Shades of Green,” set to take place on Jan. 29 at 4:15 p.m. in the Memorial Chapel. Taylor is a professor and James E. Crowfood Collegiate Chair at the University of Michigan. She will be holding a panel presentation about the prolific legacy of the celebrated civil rights activist and will draw upon his ideas to emphasize the augmenting importance of sustainability in modern-day society. Such an interdisciplinary topic becomes particularly relevant with respect to the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Mich., a town that also possesses a 53.3 percent black population according to the 2000 United States Census. “Various parts of the Wesleyan community have been talking about how we might get different parts of the community that are working on the same issues but almost speaking a different language together, and by that I mean the student of color community and the green community,” said Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias. “[Everyone is] interested in sustainability, it’s just that those words mean different things to different people.” Farias then explained how Taylor serves as an ideal point of convergence between these two student groups. “[Taylor] is a very well-respected environmentalist,” Farias said. “She understands diversity, she understands concepts of environmental justice…and right now she’s a big name in the green philanthropy world. She’s been a key change agent in advising green communities on how to become more diverse…and she is very much integrated into that entire problem.” Green Fund Chair Zacko Brint ’16 described the way this year’s commemoration was orchestrated. “The large engagement of both the SOC [Students Of Color] and environmental communities has developed through many meetings and phone calls that engaged over 50 people,” Brint wrote in an email to The Argus. “The goal for this event was to bring many peoples together from many communities.” Brint also explained the benefits of adding campus environmentalists into the dialogue, saying that even though the focus of this year’s commemoration differs in substance, it does not so much differ in attitude. “By incorporating another large section of campus into the discussion, we are continuing a trend of trying to enact meaningful change as a result of this commemoration,” Brint wrote. “Bringing communities together, brainstorming ideas of ways to productively work together in the future, and learning from a brilliant and eloquent speaker all seem to remind me of the Reverend King.” Before this Friday’s speech, students and faculty have the opportunity to learn more about the issues that Taylor will present. The series begins with a film screening of the 2008 documentary “Trouble the Water” on Wednesday, Jan. 27 at 7:30 p.m. in PAC 001. Student organizers will facilitate a discussion after the viewing. On Thursday, Jan. 28, Taylor will hold a workshop session called “Environmental Justice, Social Justice and the Planet that Binds Us” beginning at 6:45 p.m. in Beckham Hall. Participants will primarily include students active in the environmental and SOC communities on campus. In final preparation for the keynote address, a group of selected students will strategize and brainstorm ideas going forward, as well as their long-term goals with respect to environmental justice at Wesleyan and beyond."
"From Eclectic to Berkshires: Tatge and Her University Legacy","2016-02-11","by Jake Lahut, Assistant Opinion Editor","c/o berkshireonstage.com Pamela Tatge ’84 (pronounced “Tad-gee”) has been serving as Director of Wesleyan’s Center for the Arts (CFA) for the last 16 years, but she’s been a part of the University community ever since arriving to campus in 1980 as a first-year student. She is moving on in April to become the Executive Director at Jacob’s Pillow, a dance center and school in the Berkshires with the oldest summer dance festival in the United States. Tatge spoke to The Argus about the arts at the University, ranging from her time living in Eclectic to Wesleyan’s renowned dance pedagogy and diversity.  “Wesleyan has an incredible history in the arts,” Tatge said. “First off, by dedicating 11 buildings to the arts in 1973, the idea that we built a center for the arts and that a small liberal arts college would have this kind of rich dedicated space for each of the disciplines, was really extraordinary.”  When asked what the state of the arts was by the time she returned to the University as director of the CFA in the fall of 1999, Tatge noted that the University was already a unique place for artistic activities.  “When I arrived in 1999, there were already astonishing facilities,” Tatge said. “Wesleyan was one of the few universities in the country in the 1960s to think about teaching non-Western Art. So, in the music department in particular, they felt that they had to go beyond our sights. They invited artists from Indonesia, India, and West Africa to teach in the program, and the World Music and the World Dance Programs were born there. The richness [of these programs] was in the ether, it was in the fiber; it was a very international place.”  Although the arts were rich and rather cosmopolitan at Wesleyan when Tatge arrived, they were conversely also insular in that they were mostly oriented towards the campus alone. Tatge noticed this conundrum right away, and began to try to make Wesleyan an artistic center for Connecticut at large.  “The programming at the Center for the Arts was generally directed towards the campus, and artists of great note were brought [in],” Tatge noted.“But there was not, I would say, an active engagement with the community, in other words, active marketing. There was no box office system, it was hard tickets. You didn’t know who was coming and going through the door. So, [there was] an incredibly solid foundation for the arts at Wesleyan, but without, let’s say, a real dedication of resources to engaging with the community.” One of the main reasons why Jacob’s Pillow noticed Tatge as a formidable candidate was because of her innovations in dance at Wesleyan. She found to be a way to make not only her mark at the school, but also Wesleyan’s mark in the arts more broadly, due to the pedagogical opportunities dance presents, as well as how the performance of dance can synthesize the arts into a total work of art.  “When I looked around to say, ‘How can Wesleyan make its mark? How can it distinguish itself in the total ecology of the arts in the state?’ I realized two things,” Tatge recalled.“First of all, Wesleyan had a rich history in dance. It was one of the first liberal arts colleges to have dance [as] an academic subject separate from theater or, as Williams [designates it], the physical education department. So, number one, Wesleyan had a history circularly in dance.” The second part of Tatge’s realization lay in the power of the pen: “Wesleyan University Press is one of the premier publishers of dance scholarship in our country.”  Finally, Tatge looked at the student engagement in dance at Wesleyan. “I don’t know what the statistic was when I started, but right now forty percent of Wesleyan students graduate having taken a dance class. Forty percent. So with all of that being true, I then looked outward and realized that there are very few places to see contemporary dance in our state… I thought, ‘Okay, this is where we can create a niche for ourselves.’”  Then, with the cooperation of the Dance Department, Tatge cofounded the Breaking Ground Dance Series in the fall of 2000. The goal was to identify three companies annually that would represent the “next wave,” as Tatge calls it, of innovation in dance that has a social justice message and also an international component to it.  “That’s one of the distinctive things about Wesleyan,” Tatge expressed. “Instead of having an independent curator come in and say, ‘You should have this, that, and the other,’ and then scurrying around to get engagement by the departments and students and faculty, we actually dialogue with the faculty and students up front, and say, ‘Who are you excited about?’” Tatge also weighed in on how Wesleyan has changed culturally from her time here as a student and over the course of her tenure at the helm of the CFA. Her answer was different than those of most alumni.  “I do think that society has changed and our culture has changed so that students have much more pressure on them in terms of their career choices and because of the cost of their education, repaying debt, etcetera,” she said. “So perhaps they don’t have the freedom of choice that we had when I was graduating.” When asked if students’ choices are now more utilitarian than they were during her time as a student, Tatge pointed to the phenomenon of double majoring and making what one studies more “marketable.”  “[Students now have] more direction in terms of how marketable their major is going to be,” Tatge said. “I think there’s pressure on students to question that in ways that we didn’t have to. How have students answered that? There are many more double majors than there were when I went to school.” Tatge also noted that students are more diverse and international than they were during her time here in the 1980s, which she thinks has enriched the culture of the school greatly. She also pointed out the “entrepreneurial smarts” that students seem to have today that they didn’t a few decades ago, which, coupled with technology, has astonished Tatge in the kinds of endeavors that students have launched while still undergrads.  Wesleyan’s music scene is also a source of great pride for Tatge, who was a member of Eclectic and lived there.  “We always have had a music subculture that was just incredible, like at Eclectic,” Tatge said. “I lived at Eclectic [because] I loved to dance, so there were great bands that were there all the time. I always felt like I never took this place for granted and I went to a place that allowed me to do so much, and I think that’s still true.”"
"The Future of a Wes Resource Center","2016-02-18","by Azher Jaweed, Contributing Writer","Last November, the Is This Why campaign presented five demands to University President Michael Roth, one of which was the “Establishment of a Multicultural Center and a Director of Multicultural Affairs.” The center, according to the Is This Why website, was envisioned as a non-residential space that would facilitate community and support among students who come from historically marginalized backgrounds. According to the website, the space would be used by students interested in social programming, advocacy, education, and community engagement. The idea of a multicultural center may seem similar to other places at the University, like the University Organizing Center (UOC) or the Center for African American Studies (CAAS), but the UOC is a student run space and CAAS is specific to African American Studies and students from the African diaspora. The multicultural center would be funded by the administration and open for all students from marginalized backgrounds.  Current Discourse A lot has changed since the Is This Why campaign presented its demands on Nov. 18. On Nov. 20, Roth announced a new task force, chaired by Professor of Anthropology Gina Athena Ulysse, Shardonay Pagett ’18, and Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias. “At the end of last semester I indicated we would be creating a task force to explore the establishment of a multicultural resource center as part of our broader effort to improve equity and inclusion on campus,” Roth wrote in an email to all students on Jan. 7. The structure is now referred to as the Resource Center instead of the Multicultural Center, and may also encompass the roles of a gender resource center and first-generation, low-income student center.     This is actually not the first committee tasked with drafting recommendations for a multicultural center at the University. Back in 1990, a “Multicultural Committee” co-chaired by Khachig Tölölyan, now Director of the College of Letters, and Diem Ha ’93, along with eight other members, was similarly tasked with, according to the minutes of the first meeting, creating recommendations about the establishment of a multicultural center. On May 1, 1991, the committee recommended hiring a multicultural coordinator, but decided against establishing a physical multicultural center. On Feb. 8, Roth stated that he had yet to form personal opinions about the establishment of a center.  “I’m waiting to hear what a multicultural resource center will do,” he said. “How do we know it’ll be successful? How will it relate to other things we do? So I’m just waiting to hear what students want and what it will do.” Part of the reason Roth is waiting for final recommendations, he said, is due to problems with student use in previous resource centers. “We’ve had resource centers in the past and they haven’t been used very much by students after they initially opened, so I want to make sure this is something that will have a meaningful impact,” Roth added.   Lily Kong ’16, one of four students involved in drafting a proposal for the Gender Resource Center, thinks that the administration should play a larger role in maintaining such spaces once they have been established. “Part of the reason why the administration is concerned is because there was a Women’s Center in the 80s and another in the 2000s,” Kong said. “The administration’s question is why would it be different now? It’s like the same as the multicultural center…. My response to that question is that the reason the center hasn’t worked out in the past is because the administration has not been supportive of the students, not because the students don’t care.”  The Equity Task Force published its interim report online Feb. 14. The report succinctly discusses the history of how Wesleyan has faced the challenge of dealing with issues of inclusion and discrimination. “Previous committees and task forces show that Wesleyan has made multiple attempts to address issues of difference and racial tensions, but to limited success at best,” the report reads. “The same problems keep recurring.”  The report continues by stating its initial recommendation.  “[This Report recommends the] creation of an integrative educational experience that will continue to reach across all parts of campus life including students, staff, and faculty, through a physical center and institutional initiatives for the indefinite future,” the report reads.  It is important to note that these are not the final recommendations, but only the work that the committee has done so far. The final report will be published on May 1 after the task force finishes the discovery phase and conducts field research on the topic.  Resource Centers in Other Universities Unlike Wesleyan, other schools in the NESCAC have established physical spaces for historically marginalized students. Bowdoin College has the Student Center for Multicultural Life, the purpose of which is to create a supportive space dedicated to historically underrepresented students.  “[The Student Center for Multicultural Life provides] a home away from home for students from backgrounds traditionally underrepresented at Bowdoin (specifically first generation students, students of racial and ethnic minorities, and low-income students),” the Bowdoin College Center’s website reads.  Bowdoin provides a functioning example of a space that the Is This Why campaign envisioned, and it is not an exception.  Amherst College has the Multicultural Resource Center. “The Center fosters the development of identity consciousness, allyship, leadership, and social justice within the Amherst community,” the Amherst College Center’s website reads. “As such, it designs programs, facilitates discussions, advises student groups, and provides workshops and trainings.” Hamilton College has the Days-Massolo Center at Hamilton College.  “The center’s mission is to promote community inclusion, engage in intercultural dialogue, build collaborations, and establish partnerships that help make Hamilton College a welcoming environment for faculty, staff, and students,” the Hamilton College website reads. The Pugh Center at Colby College, the Davis Center at Williams College, and the Office of Multicultural Education in Bates are also examples of centralized services for historically marginalized groups.  Although Tufts University, Trinity College, and Connecticut College do not have similar services in one physical structure, they offer services for groups like LGBTQ+ students, international students, and women in separate locations. Prospects for the Future Some individuals from the Is This Why campaign and the student advisory board have looked to the other groups for essential knowledge about submitting proposals working with administration. One such group is the Gender Resource Center (GRC) team, which is chaired by, Kong, Nina Gurak ’16, Isabel Alter ’17, and Michelle J. Lee ’16, four students who have spent the last two and a half years creating a concrete GRC proposal with the help of students, faculty, and staff.  The team has a similar rationale for demanding a space as the Is This Why campaign.  “Often what we were doing was replicated by groups before us, and how that information is lost because there is no strong mechanism,” Gurak said. “And part of that has to do with having a space. Although a space is not the answer to gender equity, racial justice, or anything like that, it just creates a space where people can go if they have questions. And especially…we were finding feminist activism to be so fragmented that having a space to center that would be really exciting.” According to Kong, the GRC continues to face recurring problems when making proposals to create a gender resource center. “There has been a lot of back-and-forth with the administration where they tell us what edits we need to make, us making them, and then giving us even more concerns, or even telling us do the opposite of what they told us to do in the past,” Kong said.  The “back-and-forth” between students and administration, Farias said, is often a critique by students who work with administration.  “If something as complex as a research paper requires many drafts, then something even more complex such as creating a center, something that will last, is far more complex than that,” Farias said. “The back-and-forth is not about dragging feet, but it’s actually about making the suggestion better.” The current status of the GRC may serve as a forecast for future hurdles that the Equity and Inclusion Task Force, Student Advisory Board, and other groups working on the Resource Center may face.  One suggestion Caroline Liu ’18, a student member of the Equity Task Force, has for the community is to hold the task force accountable and take all feedback under consideration.  Going back to the plans of the current resource center, Hailey Broughton-Jones ’18, a student who contributed in drafting the demands and also a member of the Student Advisory Board, believes that the task force must have a long-term commitment to promoting equity and inclusion. “We need a structure that is embedded in the institution of the university and will be positioned so that it will continue to represent our presence far past when we graduate,” Broughton-Jones said. She also suggests that to properly solve problems of equity and inclusion on campus the task force must exist beyond May 1, the expected date for the final report from the Equity and Inclusion Task Force. “The equity task force was born out of student pressure, and if that pressure is gone the committee will most likely dissolve,” she said. “We need to address boundaries between student, faculty, and staff and also combat the hierarchies between those groups to properly discuss the creation of a Resource Center.”  Farias says such a proposal was discussed in the interim report. “There was a recommendation that the president consider continuing a task force in some iteration, whether the same members, or a recompilation of members, and then also an eventual standing committee that has to do with diversity and inclusion and equity,” Farias said."
"Wes Athletics Meets World: Keeler ’78 Rockin’ the Boat Around the Globe","2016-02-22","by Gili Lipman, Sports Editor","Title IX had just passed when Kathy Keeler ’78 arrived at Wesleyan as a first-year. The athletic program saw its female sports teams double in number from six to 12 by the time she donned a cap and gown. Keeler’s professional rowing resume speaks for itself as she has landed on four U.S. national teams, earning a silver medal in the women’s four at the World Rowing Championships in Lucerne, Switzerland, and winning gold in the women’s eights during the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games. The rower’s collegiate success peaked in her last year when she and seven others captured the Dad Vail title, which was equivalent to a national small-college rowing crown. The present Cardinal women’s crew has a four-seat shell that bears Keeler’s name. Keeler’s athletic talents as a Cardinal were not confined to paddling on the water, as she played basketball for her first three years, leading the team in scoring and rebounding during both her sophomore and junior seasons. Her impact on growing female sports at Wesleyan earned Keeler, one of two females, an induction into the inaugural class of Wesleyan’s Athletic Hall of Fame in 2008. The Argus got the chance to speak with one of Wesleyan’s first successful female athletes, and Keeler revealed her admiration for Swiss cows in the country side, her preference of Olin over Sci Li, and of course, her long shelf of rowing medals. The Argus: When was your first experience with rowing? Kathy Keeler: It was on the Connecticut River in Middletown, CT, during my freshman year. I went out for field hockey, but when I looked at Wesleyan, the crew coach had spoken with me, and Title IX had just passed. I started going out on a single and a double at two o’clock in the afternoon before field hockey started. A: How were you able to juggle being a multi-sport athlete at Wesleyan? KK: Well, it was different back then, I would think. The time commitment wasn’t the same, the intensity of the workouts wasn’t the same, and I just liked doing sports every day. The teams didn’t train out of season, and basketball didn’t start until sometime in November, around when the field hockey and crew season ended, so I didn’t have to worry about missing any preseason workouts. Then basketball finished and crew started again, and it all clicked together. A: Do you have a favorite class from your time at Wesleyan? KK: I had a favorite professor. Dick Miller of the Economics department. A: I’ve actually met him before, and he’s a really good lecturer. KK: He’s still around? A: He’s now Professor Emeritus, but he was a guest speaker in one of my classes on welfare economics a few years back. A: What’s your fondest moment from your time in college? KK: When we won the Dad Vail Regatta my senior year; that was kind of a magical moment with everything coming together, and even though I went on to win some pretty impressive things, that was still my favorite race to win, in terms of being unexpected and not having thought that that would happen. This was the opposite when I was on the national team at the Olympics. There was more pressure on us because we knew we were going there to win. It was really cool to give your hardest effort and lead the race the whole way, and after the race, I remember the men’s team coming by and singing the Alma Mater for us. A: Where was the spot that you went to study when you really needed to buckle down and get work done? KK: I loved to go into the quiet room in Olin with the cool desks, the lamps, and the old chairs. Although, when I was there, the science center was open 24 hours a day, so if you had some big project, you could always go in the basement and stay there all night long. A: Where is the coolest destination that you have ever gone to for a rowing competition? KK: When I travelled to Lucern, Switzerland. The race was exactly 2,000m long, and on one side, there was this big hill with cows with cowbells that you could hear while you were rowing. On the opposite side were the fans, of course, but we always went down before the race to take pictures of the cows on the other side. A: Do you still keep in touch with the other members of your Olympic winning boat? KK: We’ve had a reunion every ten years for a while. There was one in 2014 and 2004, and we’re trying to have them more often, but who knows? It is really fun to get together, and a couple of them live in the Boston area, so I see them a little more frequently. We’re in touch, but we don’t see each other too regularly. They’re like the equivalent of my college buddies. A: What was your mindset going into the Olympics after taking a silver medal two years prior at the World Championships? KK: It was complicated. We won a pre-Olympic regatta in Switzerland, which made us the favorites for the Olympics. There was a lot of pressure that you feel, despite all the fun that you have. The boat was awesome, and we had great practices all of the time. People always ask if the race was the most exciting thing, but I think that the training together, and knowing and trusting everyone in your boat is the great thing. When it comes down to crunch time, you have that in the back of your mind that you don’t have any doubts or worries. A: Did you have any music that you liked to listen to before you raced, or any pre-race rituals in general? KK: No, never. People do now, but no. I had a stretching routine, a breathing one, those kinds of things, but not music. A: How much of an influence were you in your daughter’s decision to also become a rower? KK: Her father [Harry Parker] was also a famous rower, and we put no pressure on her to row, because if you do that, then she won’t. We were delighted in high school when she decided that she wanted to do that, sort of surprised and delighted. She tried a lot of other sports, and somehow she’s found that the hard work ethic is something she really likes, and she pursues it very intensely. It’s fun to watch, but it’s shocking at the same time. If we told her that she had to row, I’m sure she wouldn’t. A: What are you up to these days? KK: I’m doing volunteer coaching with the Harvard Crew program, working out, tutoring at an inner-city program, and a little bit of work with a community outreach program for troubled kids in Boston. A: How did you find out that you were inducted into the Wesleyan Athletic Hall of Fame, and what was your first thought? KK: I was in the first class, and I had kind of heard that it was happening, so when [former athletic director] John Biddiscombe told me, I was like yay. I was excited and I figured that I should be inducted, so I wasn’t necessarily surprised, but I was really pleased that I was recognized. This was especially true because I wanted to make sure that there were women recognized, since there is a whole history of men in sports who were so much before me. When I was at Wesleyan, there were no awards for any female athletes, and all of the trophies were for men’s sports. For my senior year, they gave my teammates and I just a general award because we were good, but it wasn’t an official award. That next year, Suki [Hoagland ’78] started the first prize for any female. It was nice to finally be recognized. A: Any more thoughts? KK: I loved my experience at Wesleyan and the opportunities that were given to me. Title IX had just passed, so when I started at Wes, there were six female teams, and when I graduated, there were twelve. It was exploding at that time, and a lot of us had never done sports in high school, since there weren’t any chances, so it was kind of a new world. I love to come back and see what all of the opportunities are for the women now."
"Age Beyond Numbers","2016-02-29","by Sammi Aibinder, Opinion Editor","c/o damronchiropractic.com A little over a year ago, my 88 year-old grandmother took a fall that ended up sparking a whole slew of medical problems that landed her in the hospital for a while. Both the fall and her stay in the hospital took a major toll on her body, eventually leading to a transfer to a rehabilitation center and nursing home complex so that she could regain her strength. Of course, Grammy’s time in the rehab center had its disheartening moments: She was in a lot of pain, and it took a level of endurance to get herself back on her feet (literally) that none of the rest of our family, relatively young and spry, could imagine. But I thought the place was nice. She was getting quality therapy and assistance, and made quite a few friends and admirers among the other residents during her time there. My mother could agree with about as much in terms of the center’s benefits, but she was nevertheless pretty miserable in that space. She expressed to me on more than one occasion how spending the last years of her life in a nursing home is one of the more depressing things she could imagine. This got me to thinking about the different ways in which we typically conceptualize old age, how the elderly engage with the rest of society, and how to improve senior living spaces to the advantage of everyone. One of the obvious things about a nursing home, a retirement community, or an assisted-living space is that the residents are old. But I think that a lot of people who feel dispirited by these kinds of environments aren’t necessarily upset by old age in general; after all, old age is often a cause for celebration and joy. The experiences and knowledge we can gain from older generations are invaluable. Instead, the reason for the aversion to senior living spaces has a lot more to do with how society typically defines aging well, and how residents in those places tend to illustrate the criteria commonly associated with having aged poorly. Last November, Professor Shellae Versey presented a lecture at the College of the Environment’s annual symposium, “Where on Earth Are We Going?” that raised this very question of what it means to “age well,” and how the common definition tends to be pretty narrow. She discussed biological factors that come into play—like being free of disease, having high physical and mental functioning, and generally being self-sufficient—as well as socialfactors, like the extent to which a person engages with other people and their general surroundings. Professor Versey emphasized the importance of establishing our own personal gauges for what it means to age well, and her own research additionally suggested the significance of the social engagement component. As we climb up into old age, we are likely a lot more apt to consider the conditions of our personal bodies over our social environments in relation to our physical and mental health. But Professor Versey’s research indicates that what she calls “generativity” (the satisfaction of giving to others) increases with old age, that feeling useful (through your social environment) can make or break your physical health, and that as we get older and older, the influence of genetics on health declines while the influence of environment goes up. This knowledge points to the ways in which senior-living spaces could be made better, and why people may feel they are unfavorable in general. My particular qualms with senior living spaces have to do with how they encourage residents to connect with others outside of the residence, in light of the positive impacts that “generativity” and feeling useful can have on health (especially in old age). I think that this connection could be improved by shifting how we think about integrating different-aged communities, like connecting pre-schools and elementary schools with surrounding older-aged communities. For example, I can recall countless choral and dance performances of my childhood at senior living communities. Granted, I think that the residents were very pleased by these recitals—regardless of how well they could hear the music. Such is the effect of having a break in the monotonous age dynamic typically present in those spaces. But there are better options. Another activity in which my elementary school partook was having special days for residents from senior living communities to come to school and teach us how to sew. There is clearly much more of an engagement component in the latter example; the residents were taking an active role in our learning experiences, thus giving back to their community in a more effectual way than being passive audience members. This kind of intergenerational engagement has been developed in different ways, all over the world, for a long time. A nursing home in Seattle called Providence Mount St. Vincent shares its facilities with a pre-school five days a week. Established in 1991, the program is called an Intergenerational Learning Center (ILC) and provides social interaction between the two age groups to flourish and develop a reciprocal relationship of learning and care. Seattle is not the birthplace of this idea: It originated in Japan and has spread across the U.S. and Canada. Another example of intergenerational engagement from Professor Versey’s research is the idea of having university-based retirement communities; in other words, setting up a senior living space in proximity to a university to promote the greater community’s use of university resources. Wesleyan’s Wasch Center for Retired Faculty currently runs the Wesleyan Institute for Lifelong Learning, designed to extend Wesleyan’s educational resources beyond just enrolled students. Perhaps this program can be extended to senior-living communities in the greater Middlesex County area, and also be developed to increase student accessibility.  Moving towards intergenerational spaces, and keeping an emphasis on how they can foster social engagement that is key to human health, is one way to have a positive impact on how we view old age and care for the aged. These spaces can help expand common conceptions of what old age entails, and break the stigma that being old means being static and out of touch with the rest of society.

"WesWell Receives “4 Million Dollar” This is Why Donation","2016-02-29","by Aaron Stagoff-Belfort, Features Editor","c/o freshcent.com WesWell, the University’s Office of Health Education, received a huge boost last week from the This is Why campaign: a $4 million gift courtesy of John ’62 and Ruth Huss. WesWell strives to ease the mental and emotional strain of University life on students through its We Speak, We Stand bystander intervention and Peer Health Advocate (managing drug and alcohol use) programs. In addition, the office works to address issues concerning sexual assault, sleep, nutrition, and stress. WesWell also acts as a liaison for students to advocate for changes in campus policies that promote a healthier and safer campus environment. “At Wesleyan, we live together, we learn together, and we look out for one another,” said Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean Mike Whaley in a press release on the University’s website and in an email to The Argus. “WesWell’s continued commitment to promoting and supporting a healthy, safe campus community will help make that goal a reality. The educational mission of the office is so important to making sure that Wesleyan students have the knowledge they need in order to make good and healthy decisions. I’ll be working with Tanya Purdy and others in Student Affairs to assess our most pressing needs and to deploy these new resources in ways that will have the most positive impact. Wesleyan students can achieve so much when they have a healthy foundation.” When asked about how the funds from the donation would be allocated, WesWell Director Tanya Purdy spoke about the need to increase support for preexisting programs. “We are always improving existing programming through our thorough evaluation process, which takes a great deal of time and expert resources,” Purdy wrote in an email to The Argus.  “The We Speak, We Stand program, the Peer Alcohol Health Education Coach program, the Wellness Experience program, the Recovery@ program, the Safer Sex, Cold & Flu, and Stress Relief kits we offer. [This includes] the close to 100 individual health education sessions we provide each academic year, which are just a few of the projects WesWell needs to be able to maintain and consistently offer quality improvements for.” One aspect of WesWell’s platform that makes it such an attractive option for increased funding is the office’s active approach in forming smaller communities within the University. For example, their Recovery@ program (which Purdy mentioned as one potential outlet for funds) creates a network between students and administrators who are recovering from drug or alcohol abuse. The program does not offer formal therapy, but is instead run primarily by its members through discussion and social engagements with the greater Middletown community. One area where WesWell’s This is Why donation could prove particularly useful is in providing safer sex supplies. As the office writes in its commitment statement, “Safer sex supply availability on campus sends the clear message that engaging in safer sex practices is important in any sexual relationship, no matter if it is short or long term.” Student organizations that purchase large orders of the supplies place a considerable strain on the office’s ability to distribute them free of charge. This gift is crucial to the office’s mission of offering both material and emotional support to the University community at an affordable cost. In the near future, Purdy believes that she needs to do further research to determine exactly how the funds for such a sizable gift will be allocated. “I would like to conduct another student health needs assessment to see what would be the best use of WesWell’s resources in terms of impacting overall wellbeing so that students can succeed academically and personally,” Purdy wrote. Purdy also hopes that news of the gift will spark further interest in getting students to volunteer for WesWell. The office offers two paid positions for University students, including hosting four WesWell Interns who advise the Director of Health Education and Peer Health Advocates. The other paid position is as manager of WesBAM!, Wesleyan’s Body and Mind program which offers a variety of dance and exercise classes. “WesWell’s volunteers play a huge role in making all of the programs successful,” Purdy wrote. “We rely on them to deliver much of the education and resources that WesWell offers. Our hope is to provide all of our volunteers with an experience that allows them to gain some professional development in the fields of health education and public health in return for their very valuable time and energy.”"
"Task Force Discusses Multicultural Center","2016-03-03","by Sonya Sternlieb, Contributing Writer","Founded in response to the demands put forth by the Is This Why movement, the Equity Task Force’s mission involves the establishment of a multicultural resource center, which aims to foster greater equity and inclusion in the Wesleyan community. On Tuesday, March 1, the task force held a student forum to solicit student feedback about the findings and recommendations put forth in its interim report. The Equity Task Force is chaired by Professor of Anthropology and of Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies Gina Ulysse, Shardonay Pagett ’18, and Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias. Board members also include Patricelli Center Director Makaela Kingsley ’98; Professor of History, East Asian Studies, Science in Society, and Environmental Studies William Johnston; Associate Professor of English and American Studies Matthew Garrett; and students Henry Martellier ’19 and Caroline Liu ’18. Hailey Broughton-Jones ’18 began the discussion, emphasizing the necessity of acquiring faculty involvement and making the Center a place of tangible meaning rather than just an empty space. Ulysse added on to Broughton-Jones’ points. Referencing her own research on Women’s Studies Centers, Ulysse stressed the importance of providing the future Multicultural Center with an intellectual basis and ties to academic departments. “Centers that had an activist end that were not tied to departments or didn’t have an integral intellectual component became these marginal spaces, became transient,” Ulysse said, citing her own research. Staff and faculty involvement, Ulysse said, would help counteract the fleeting nature of a student body with a consistently rapid turnover. As the discussion turned toward faculty involvement, Director of Student Activities and Leadership Development Elisa Cardona brought up faculty concerns about the invisible labor that activism and engagement requires of faculty with already heavy workloads. “There’s this notion of labor, and what is valued labor, and who gets to determine what’s labor versus service,” she said. “What do we see as components of this work?” Cardona went on to stress the importance of the center as a place where students can be their whole selves, tying together the intellectual, activist, and personal aspects of their lives. Following the event, there was a student forum to garner feedback. Pagett began the meeting with an announcement. “This is for you guys to voice your concerns, your thoughts, your opinions on the interim report that we put up,” Pagett said. “We want to hear from you guys and see what you really think.” Ulysse returned to this theme later in the forum, expressing her frustration with student engagement. “I’m a little disappointed in students in part for this,” Ulysse said. “You made demands, we did a report, we didn’t even hear back from you. You ask us to do something, we’re starting to deliver, but you’re not having a conversation, even to say this is not good enough. No response is not the way to begin a conversation.” However, Victoria King ’18 offered a response. “I think there are a lot of student activists who feel like there’s no reason to invest in this university at this point, or they’re tired of being invested in things and not seeing a return,” she said. “I don’t think everyone knows the people on the task force or trusts everyone on [it].” The discussion then turned toward the nature of the Center’s mission. “I really strongly feel like it should be a space where everyone is supposed to be, not just all the oppressed groups,” said Taylor McClain ’17. “I think a lot of problems [exist] because people can’t expose themselves to one another, or don’t understand each other’s experience. I feel like there’s not a space on campus where everyone…[can] have our experiences shared on equal footing.” Pagett concurred, adding that the Center won’t work if the rest of the campus isn’t working on itself to be a part of this Center. “I see the Multicultural Center as a space that allows all of us…to be fully present with our entire community…[and] it empowers you in a different way to be able to have a space that you can call your own, [where] you know you can be in community with people who look like you,” King said. “I still think that it’s our right to have a space that people can have their own claim to…I think that white students have that, this whole campus is theirs.” Ulysse and Cardona both stressed the ways that they had been personally impacted by multicultural centers in the past, but also cautioned against letting go of other spaces. “I couldn’t have survived my undergrad education without my multicultural center,” Ulysse said. “But I didn’t cede those [other] spaces. Because when we recede from certain spaces, we don’t get a retraction, we don’t get to own them later on. So I think it’s very important to make a very clear distinction between what we need to keep us going, and also how we keep engaging in the fight with our presence.” Suggested ideas for equity initiatives included holding social justice and activist workshops in the Center for students, faculty, and staff, as well as extending efforts to hire more diverse professors familiar with social justice. The forum concluded with a collective desire for more student input and a plan for another, better-attended meeting. “I believe in that center more than anybody else,” Ulysse said. “That center’s going to exist if I can do anything about it.” The Equity Task Force welcomes student input, and more information can be found at equity.wesleyan.edu."
"Raising the Bar: Wesleyan and Vines on Church","2016-03-28","by Julian Johnson, Contributing Writer","It’s hump day. You have a 9 a.m. tomorrow, but you still want to go out and let off some steam. That guy you’ve been eyeing will be there, and you’ll be able to dance your heart out. Maybe your friends will be way too sloppy drunk, but it’s okay because it’s BAR NIGHT! Especially if you’re an athlete and you have games on the weekend, this is your night. But in the midst of the drunken small talk and getting sandwiched by two brawny basketball players, have you thought about the story of Vines on Church? Meet Neil Baloga. He grew up on the other side of the bridge, and he took over Vines on Church about a year ago with the intention of turning it into the “quintessential Wesleyan bar.” He’s dealt with everything from customers stealing paintings, to paranormal activity, to the case of Obama’s visiting nephew peeing in his closet (according to Baloga). With the hoard of people who storm the bar every Wednesday, you’d think the bar was making a killing. But Baloga says the opposite is true. “To tell you the truth, since I started here, I haven’t taken home a paycheck, and we’re always on the verge of closing,” he said.“I have to spend so much on security, inventory, cleanup, and, when it happens, theft. I’m barely paying the electricity bill with what happens on Wednesday nights, which is sad because it’s really the only night I have here.” Most Wesleyan students pregame before they go to bar night because they want to save money or they want to partake in the ritual with their friends. But this is taking a toll on Vines on Church’s business. Neil had to stop taking Middletown cash because he couldn’t pay his Internet bill. When asked about the possibility of closing, he expressed more concern for his employees and the tenants. “I hired primarily people that were coming from addiction backgrounds,” he said. “A lot of the people that live here upstairs are in programs. There’s a family of four and three workers that depend on housing.” If the place shut down, “the people that put their pride and faith into this place and work so hard for next to nothing” would be “ass out.” For most of us University students, this is the one place in town that we truly frequent, and it’s barely off campus. We already don’t have a great relationship with the Middletown community. As Neil puts it, “the two crowds are like oil and water.” There are many excuses for this, including age differences and socioeconomic division, but as a school that prides itself on inclusivity and community engagement, there is certainly room for improvement. Neil, on the other hand, has a strong relationship with Middletown residents. During our interview, a man walked into the bar and asked Neil, “How often do you use the garage?” Without even asking, he said, “Use it,” and told him to make a copy of his key. In contrast to his generous character, we tend to come into bar night and abuse the space with very little reciprocity. On Wednesdays, according to Baloga, Middletown residents “avoid this place like the plague.” Instead of focusing on the negatives, let’s focus on the positive possibilities. People complain about frats being shut down and parties being overcrowded because there are so few options on campus, but this is a space that we are welcome to use. To all of you who want to show your art and who are confused by the event planning process, this is your new place, and it’s unregulated by Wesleyan. This is a call to anyone involved in music, stand-up, photography, painting, improv, poetry slams, interpretive dancing, performance art, etc. Let’s seize this opportunity to foster a better relationship with the town and help improve the night life. Not to mention, Neil has been cooking for 14 years and he can make some dope food. If any of you have any ideas for this space, feel free to reach out to me (and I could also get you in touch with Neil). Johnson is a member of the class of 2019."
"University Searches for New Dean for Equity and Inclusion, Three Candidates Remain","2016-03-28","by Natasha Nurjadin, News Editor","Lex Spirtes, Photo Editor Over Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday of last week, the University hosted three candidates for the position of Dean for Equity and Inclusion. The three candidates each visited campus for one full day, engaging in conversations with all members of the community, which culminated in a 45-minute presentation at an open forum. The new dean will work for the Office of Equity and Inclusion, which currently reports to Vice President for Equity and Inclusion and Title IX Officer Antonio Farias. “The Office of Equity & Inclusion provides leadership and accountability to resolve systemic inequities for all members of the Wesleyan community through a metrics-based approach to research, education, and service, by promoting a healthy, thriving campus climate and a community of excellence,” the Office of Equity and Inclusion’s mission statement reads. The search was prompted when the previous dean, Renee Johnson-Thornton, moved to her current position of Dean for the Class of 2018 earlier this school year. The search was convened by a committee consisting of Farias; Equity Compliance Director Debbie Colucci; Fisk Professor of Natural Science, Professor of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Professor of Integrative Sciences Ishita Mukerji; Assistant Director of Human Resources Anjali Tamhanker; and Shardonay Pagett ’18. The three candidates included Director of Institutional Diversity, Equity, Advocacy and Leadership at Temple University Carmen Phelps; Assistant Director of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion at Kenyon College Monique Jernigan; and Director of Community and Organizational Development at the University of Rhode Island Vicki Sapp. As supervisor to the Dean for Equity and Inclusion position, Farias convened the search committee and created the job description. “It’s clear that there is an ongoing need for someone at this level to interact with students, faculty and staff, as well as interface with multiple groups and programs on campus,” Mukerji wrote in an email to The Argus. Mukerji, who was asked to be on the search committee, is actively involved in the Wesleyan Math and Science Scholars (WesMaSS) program. The program supports students from underrepresented groups studying math and sciences. “I am hoping the new dean, [who will hold the position of associate director of WesMaSS], will be able to establish these same kinds of relationships with the scholars,” Mukerji wrote. “I and the current director of the WesMaSS program, [Associate Professor of Chemistry] David Westmoreland, expect to be working with the new dean quite closely in the context of this program. The committee looked for talented, experienced personnel and chose the three candidates out of over 100 who applied. “It was a competitive pool and the top candidates had many of the qualifications that we were looking for in the new dean including background and experience in the area of the position,” Mukerji said. Farias echoed this sentiment in saying that the candidates were all ideal, but this was a hard decision because there were many other applicants who were qualified. “The committee came down to these three, not because there were many others who weren’t qualified, but these were the three that we felt were the strongest candidates, and felt had the capacity to fulfill the job,” Farias said. The three candidates each had to come to the University for an entire day to simulate the experience that they would have if they were to work as the dean. “They’re purposely put through the ringer,” Farias said. “They go through an entire [day]. [In the] morning, they meet with me at 8 a.m.…and it ends at 5 p.m. They meet with all constituencies that you can imagine. They meet with faculty, staff, [and] they meet with students.” Farias said that these candidates are put through a long day meeting with different constituencies at the University so that they can understand what kind of position they are about to take on. He said that the full-day visit is a very taxing process for the candidates. “It’s done on purpose, it’s done because, it’s part of the way it happens at Wesleyan, but it’s also part of [what’s needed for] the job,” Farias said. “There are days, multiple days, where this is the norm, you are coming in at eight o’clock in the morning, [and] you’re not leaving… until nine o’clock in the evening, then you get up the next morning and do it again.” Farias wanted to see whether or not the candidates could handle this long day schedule. “Partly it’s also to see stamina,” Farias said. “Can you deal with this high tempo environment, and also the multivariance of the populations you engage with?” The choice to have a presentation at the end of the day was in line with this idea of testing the candidate’s stamina. Farias wanted to see their energy at the end of the long day. “It’s all to see performance…to see how they perform under the Wesleyan environment,” Farias said. “It’s close to a simulation of a workday, and the tough questions and engagement that they’re going to have if they take the position.” The candidates were all given the same prompt that they had to respond to in their presentations. “Deliver a 45-minute interactive presentation addressing faculty, staff and students on developing core competencies needed to help historically underrepresented students thrive,” their prompt read. The presentations, which were open to all from the University, attracted people from different parts of the community. “It’s an easy way for a lot of different people to have an opportunity to interact with the candidates and get a sense of how the candidate might respond to their concerns,” Mukerji wrote. “The new dean will interface with a number of different constituencies on campus, so it’s important to get feedback from all these different groups about the candidate. The open forum is one mechanism to get this critical feedback.” The ideal candidate, according to Farias, is someone who can handle all the busy workdays and who can also move up and down the ladder, in the sense that they will be able to interact with all members of the community. “They have to be very comfortable, very socially engaged, very empathic,” Farias said. “That’s critical for this position, the ability to hear people to listen, and to be a very well-rounded educator.” The candidates also have the opportunity to test the waters of the University environment when visiting campus, in seeing whether or not they could fit in. Hopefully, the position will be filled by the end of the academic year. “[Ideally, the new dean] has to be here no later than the end of the semester so we can start the process of bringing that person into the fold of the office and also getting them to understand the lay of Wesleyan,” Farias said. “The ideal would be [for the dean to] start as soon as possible when students are still here, so there can be a marination process that takes place before the semester ends.” Farias said that the position and the interview process on campus was a very tall order, but there are those who meet the standards necessary. “It’s a wild, almost rollercoaster ride of a work experience that this office and the people that work in it have,” Farias said. “This was meant to mimic that.”"
"Ortiz ’18 Looks to for Wes Form Stronger Bond with Middletown","2016-03-28","by Molly Schiff, Features Editor","c/o commons.wikimedia.com In Middletown, homelessness and hunger remain pressing issues. In Middlesex County, of which Middletown is the county seat, 470 individuals—including members of 39 families—lived in emergency or transitional housing in 2011, according to the most recent data available from the Connecticut Coalition to End Homelessness. The county is home to the same percentage of homeless individuals as that of the entire state of Connecticut. In both cases, shelters and transitional housing programs are often filled to capacity. A great number of programs exist to provide vital services to those struggling around us, and more help is always welcomed. Members of the University community often note that there exists a barrier between the campus and the greater Middletown area. Through the Center for Community Partnerships in the Office of Community Service, many programs work to bridge the gap between the adjacent communities including the Green Street Teaching and Learning Center, the Center for Prison Education, and the WESU 88.1 FM radio station. Devonaire Ortiz ’18, however, noticed another area that could see greater involvement from University students: St. Vincent de Paul. A local organization affiliated with the Catholic Church, St. Vincent de Paul operates a food pantry, a soup kitchen, and various community outreach programs to combat hunger and homelessness in Middletown and the surrounding area. Ortiz is in the process of organizing students to participate in activities not already covered by other University groups also working on alleviating these issues. In particular, Ortiz is enthusiastic about aiding St. Vincent de Paul and Middletown on reaching their goal of eliminating hunger and homelessness rather soon. “We’re still working on a name for it, but basically it’s a sort of partnership that’s come out of the Community-Based Partnerships arm of the Office of Community Service,” Ortiz said. “What St. Vincent de Paul does is work on combatting homelessness and hunger in Middletown, and I think there’s an initiative of some sort to completely eliminate chronic homelessness by 2018 in Middletown, and we’re supposed to be well on our way there. So that’s sort of how I first got excited about it.” Ortiz aims for groups of students to engage with the visitors of St. Vincent’s, sharing meals and achieving a greater understanding of aspects of Middletown life outside the University. His vision is derived from a project undertaken by students and a professor at Middlesex Community College, who have previously published the stories of the county’s homeless population. Student participation is encouraged for a variety of activities, from simply sharing meals to providing manual labor unable to be done by St. Vincent’s regular volunteers, many of whom are rather advanced in age. Additional volunteers are also needed for special events organized by St. Vincent’s directors. At a general interest meeting held on Wednesday, March 23, an agenda was set forth with activities to begin in the coming weeks. Beginning this week, students are welcome to sign up to take a ride down to St. Vincent’s and volunteer in the Amazing Grace Food Pantry or share a meal at the soup kitchen with visitors, assuming there are enough resources and extra volunteers are not needed. “Ideally, as we move into working with St. Vincent, it is important to keep in mind that this project’s foremost aim is to increase engagement between Wesleyan students, the Middletown community, and those facing challenges of homelessness, hunger, and need of all kinds,” Ortiz wrote in an email to interested students. “This comes from a belief that engagement nurtures understanding, respect, and ideally, joy for everyone involved.” Going forward, other prospective activities include joining in solidarity at the Walk Against Hunger, which will be held on May 1 in Hartford; setting up a stand on a monthly or bi-monthly basis to provide new recipes or nutritional guidance; and hosting fundraisers as well as food and item drives. Ortiz emphasizes that participation can and should vary from the incredibly concrete—four students will be going to buffer the food pantry’s floors on Thursday, March 31—to the more abstract and general. “Where engagement cannot happen, awareness/education must do, which is why we should be thinking about ways to use our time with St. Vincent’s guests and what we learn [about] their unique and diverse situations (as well as ours) for those purposes,” Ortiz wrote. “This can be through creative works (photography, writing, drawing, etc.) or through taking larger lessons from these interactions to better inform ourselves and others about the nature of resilience in the face of struggle. (We are open to ideas on how to do this).” Still in its infancy, the group has a flexible and adaptive future, according to Ortiz. Among his goals at the moment are simply growth and engagement. “For the most part, this partnership is very new in the sense that we’re looking to expand it, to have as many students as possible who would be willing to get on board with volunteering at the soup kitchen and sharing meals for the sake of engagement and interaction, because I think that’s how we break down barriers,” he said. “[Another goal is to have] a group of students who are willing to be available or at least be willing to listen to see if St. Vincent has any special needs, which a lot of the time it does.” Ortiz’s goal of sharing the narratives of homeless residents of Middletown aims to break down the barriers between the most vulnerable populations of the city and the generally privileged one at the University. “What I think I enjoy most about this is that it’s [based] in the Middletown community more so than it is at Wesleyan,” Ortiz said. Right now, the most important aspect of forming a partnership with St. Vincent de Paul is going into the Middletown community and positively contributing to the development of the city, using the University’s students to work on the community’s terms."
"Acting on Terror: How We Are Helping the Islamic State","2016-03-28","by Jake Lahut, Opinion Editor","Islamophobic reactions to terrorist attacks by the Islamic State are one of the chief goals of said attacks. These reactions are not limited to the bigotry of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz. Our collective pandemonium over the recent attacks in Brussels juxtaposed with our complete lack of care and empathy for other attacks by ISIS, particularly against Muslims in Iraq and Syria, is not only deplorable but also feeding into jihadist recruiters’ bloody hands. Our fear and its manifestations are exactly what terrorism seeks to produce. When we mistakenly lash out against an entire religion of 1.5 billion people, we legitimize the caliphate of the Islamic State, which convinces young people to think that the West is trying to destroy Islam. In reality, while the Islamic State has been responsible for horrific actions in the West, it wreaks even more havoc in the Middle East, including against Muslims, and even the Sunni Muslims it claims to protect.   Although I referred to the Islamic State by its more common acronym, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS), whose last word is often replaced by Syria or the Levant (ISIL), the latter being the chosen acronym of the Obama Administration, I will now refer to this group as Daesh (pronounced dah-esh). Why Daesh? For one, it is the Arabic acronym for the organization, ad-Dawlah al-Islāmiyah fī ‘l-ʿIrāq wa-sh-Shām. More importantly, however, Daesh is the derogatory acronym used to refer to the Islamic State, and I will use it to explicitly delegitimize this terrorist organization that the United States is at least partially responsible for. The United States’ invasion of Iraq created the power vacuum necessary for the Islamic State to flourish. Furthermore, the Bush Administration’s decision to disband the Iraqi army resulted in as many as 25 of 40 of Daesh’s top operatives having once served in the Iraqi military. Despite Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi being the caliph of Daesh, much of the ethos of the organization is indebted to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, one of the most vicious figures in the Iraq War who was killed by the U.S. Air Force in 2006. Zarqawi founded al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, which later became known as al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) when he pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden in 2004. From internal communications obtained by the intelligence community, Zarqawi was perceived as being too focused on violence, even for al-Qaeda. Warning him to focus on strategic goals against the U.S.-led coalition instead of indiscriminately attacking almost anyone—including Sunni Muslims—Attyia al-Jaza’ri, who led insurgencies in Algeria throughout the ’90s, was extremely blunt with Zarqawi, whom al-Qaeda Central viewed as a loose cannon undermining the organization’s broader strategic goals against the West. Nevertheless, AQI remained radicalized and ended up turning into the Islamic State. Zarqawi’s barbarism is now the model for Daesh, which burst onto the world stage with its beheadings, especially of Westerners like American journalist James Wright Foley. From the beginning, Foley’s tragic death reflected a key tactic of Daesh that is unfortunately all too effective: making Westerners believe that they are the disproportionate targets of Daesh’s attacks, when in fact Muslims are by far the most frequent victims of Daesh. Although not as publicized as Brussels, Paris, and even San Bernadino (the last of which was inspired by Daesh), the vast majority of attacks that Daesh claims responsibility for affect predominantly Muslim populations. By covering and—given the current climate in much of the media—freaking out about terrorist attacks in Western countries, we play right into Daesh’s hands by producing clips that are used to radicalize alienated young people who are told that they will never be welcomed in their Western home countries because they are Muslim. As for why attacks in Western countries get more sustained and in-depth media coverage, there are several simple answers. First, simply, media outlets have drastically cut down on foreign correspondents, which skews coverage to Western countries. Second, in a media market where attention is the most valuable and flighty commodity, more “surprising” attacks in whiter countries like France and Belgium receive far more journalistic resources than do attacks in the Middle East. Our perpetual war in the region has rendered us numb to the violence and carnage that comes out of the Middle East. Since high school, I have lamented that we almost never substantively confront the sacrifices of, and meaning behind the actions of, those who serve our country. Unfortunately, that is still true. Instead analyzing policies, we millennials do one of two things more often than not when we learn of terrorist attacks, depending on our politics: We either fear monger, or, more commonly within our University’s community, we engage in slacktivism. Those in the latter group fall into two groups. Either they lazily change the color filter of their profile picture, when it’s available, or they complain about the Euro- and white-centric focus of our grief toward victims of terrorist attacks. Calling out someone on social media for slacktivism is just another form of slacktivism. Not only do our Facebook statuses not make a difference, which some people at least acknowledge, but they also feed into a negativity that is beginning to characterize the millennial left. Furthermore, Facebook dialogue doesn’t even draw from the most valuable pieces on the subject. We don’t cite The Economist’s nuanced piece on how the marginalized Molenbeek neighborhood in Brussels cultivates jihadists who are never welcomed as Belgian despite being third-generation Belgians. No: instead we cite blogs, listicles, or even worse, other millennials’ equally empty Facebook statuses. Although this piece may not make a difference, it involves research and more time than sharing a Facebook status of solidarity does. I’m all for solidarity, and it is needed for the larger audiences that social media sites can carry, but do not stop there. It’s like citing a Wikipedia page without examining the actual sources in the footnotes. When we respond to terrorist attacks on social media with hatred, either toward innocent Muslims or even toward each other, we play into Daesh’s hands. Their social media team scours Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for the West’s hatred. Although they are far more likely to take the Islamophobic words of high profile figures like Donald Trump or Senator Ted Cruz, we should not be spewing fear or negativity on social media regarding Daesh’s terrorism in the first place, for that is exactly what they want us to do. More broadly, we should do the best we can not to let Daesh interfere with our daily lives. We should let President Obama attend a Cuban baseball game even in the wake of a terror attack. We should take that research grant and travel to Europe. We should take public transportation. We should think about and talk about what our military is doing not because the Islamic State has made us afraid for our lives, but because of the high cost and high veteran suicide rate that is a product of our military engagement. Before you go to the gun store and file the paperwork for your conceal-carry permit out of fear of the other, try to understand them by reading the same text that extremists in the West like Rush Limbaugh and extremists in the Middle East like Baghdadi both pervert. Read the Qur’an, and more importantly, read its footnotes. Read Surah 18 where the Abrahamic figure of Moses witnesses atrocities that test his belief, or Surah 4, where there is an entire section dedicated to Estate Law, or Surahs 2 and 60 that lay out the rules of military engagement set forth by the Prophet Muhammad, which are often taken out of context by both jihadists and those on the far right in America to argue that Islam is a violent religion. When we give into fear and violence, we give into the misconstrued notion that Islam and the Islamic State are one and the same. When we spew hatred toward everyone in a religion of 1.5 billion people, we reaffirm the sinister recruiter’s argument that the West hates Islam. When we fail to see the humanity of those who have been pushed to the margins of Western society, we not only fail them, but we fail ourselves. We only lose the War on Terror when we let ourselves act on terror. Lahut is a member of the class of 2017."
"Various Student Groups Hold Menstrual Cycle Products Drive for Middletown Homeless","2016-04-07","by Hyunji Ward, Assistant News Editor","c/o facebook.com Beginning on March 28 and continuing throughout the month of April, several groups on campus are sponsoring a Menstrual Cycle Product Drive to collect donations for members of the Middletown homeless community who may not have access to these types of products. Sponsors include Womanist House, Women of Color House, Community Engagement House, International House, Sign Language House, The Bayit, Asian/Asian American House, Women of Color Collective, Adolescent Sexual Health Awareness (ASHA), The Wesleyan Doula Project, the Planned Parenthood Chapter, Rho Epsilon Pi, and Wesleyan Advocates for Gender Equality (WAGE). “We want your tampons! diva cups! pads of all shapes and sizes!” the Facebook event reads. “Many homeless folks do not have access to menstrual cycle products, especially because of cost. Join us in collecting as many products as we can to donate to the Middletown homeless community.” One of the organizers of the drive and House Manager of Womanist House Michele Ko ’16 explained that the drive started off as a ResLife program, a collaborative effort between the house managers of several program houses around campus. Having all been working on the same staff, they wanted to facilitate a program that would bring their communities together. Once the drive was established, other groups on campus, specifically those centered on women’s health, came on board. Ko commented on how she and the other organizers came to the decision that the drive should be directed at the larger Middletown community. “I think…we wanted to donate [the products] to the Middletown homeless community because we felt like a lot of drives [being] organized on campus are very Welseyan-specific,” Ko said. “I think we need to bridge more connections between the two communities.” Lily Kong ’16, one of the co-coordinators of ASHA, was approached by Ko to co-sponsor the drive. “I think we tend not to think about homelessness and menstruation together and how they affect each other, and I know it’s something that never really crossed my mind before [Ko] approached us, but the drive really says something about how things intersect in a way that creates a lot of social issues that one would never really expect or think about immediately,” Kong wrote in an email to The Argus. The organizers, led by the House Manager of Community Engagement House Isabel Bartholomew ’18, are working directly with groups like Community Renewal Team (CRT) based in Hartford, and St. Vincent de Paul in Middletown. CRT offers childcare, education, and treatment services to residents of Central Connecticut. St. Vincent’s also offers support services such as these, but is more directly involved in providing food, as they run a community soup kitchen and a food pantry. Another way the drive is garnering support is through the application Venmo, through which individuals can electronically donate money directly from their bank accounts. Students can contribute in this way by looking up the profile @MCProductDrive on the app itself. Ko noted that this has been a popular way for students to get involved thus far. Another possibility the organizers are considering is to go through University establishments like Weshop and Usdan for additional student support. “We’re in the process of figuring out how folks can donate points to the drive,” Ko said. “So they could swipe their points, and we could use those points to buy more products for people…that we’re still working out, [but] I think it would be a good new direction for us.” At the end of the drive, the organizers plan to throw a final, celebratory event. Ideally, it would be held outside and would be a space for body and sex positivity featuring games, prizes, and refreshments. Though the event itself is still in the early planning stages, the organizers hope it can be a place for the University and the rest of Middletown to come together as one community. Ko commented on how body and sex positivity will come into play during the event. “I think a big part of it is celebrating the menstrual cycle,” Ko said. “I think it’s really silenced. People don’t talk about it…but this happens to our bodies, there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s a beautiful thing…we should be celebrating our bodies, not be ashamed [of them].” Products can be dropped off at the designated donation bins around campus, which are located at Womanist House (44 Brainerd), Women of Color House (227 Pine), Community Engagement House (28 Lawn), International House (151 Church), Sign Language House (64 Lawn), 72A Home, 264 Court, and 34 Fountain. There will also be tables set up in Usdan later this month where students can bring additional goods or donate money. Many contributions have already been made, but the organizers anticipate that these numbers will significantly increase toward the end of the year when most students are getting ready to leave campus. “The drive is a great way to actively help out, but also starts a conversation about such social issues, which is why I think it’s such a great idea,” Kong wrote. Ko shared some final thoughts on what this drive means to her and how people are motivated to get involved in initiatives in which they feel a real difference is being made. “There’s something really cool about doing something…where you know there are 30 or 40 pads in your bin right now, and [they’re] going to go to another person who’s really going to need them,” Ko said. “I think that sort of concreteness is what’s drawn a lot of people to the drive.”"
"The Wesleyan Condition: Endless Intellectual Curiosity","2016-04-11","by Jake Lahut, Opinion Editor","The Wesleyan Condition is an endless curiosity that can never go far enough. No matter what academic category our curiosities may fall under, we find ways to make them relevant to many others. This never-ending intersectional curiosity leads us to question the very underpinnings of almost everything, including our own time. This is why Wesleyan is called a “radical” school, because we are radical in the truest sense. We question the very underpinnings of everything, often to the annoyance of our friends and family back home. This questioning can and should lead us to be quite uncomfortable with many aspects of modernity. Although we do not all share the same tactics in our efforts to make the world a better place, some form of civic engagement is what unites Wesleyan students in their collective, intellectual endeavor while they study in Middletown. There are certainly students at the University who consider themselves apolitical, but there is really no such thing as being apolitical, both in the “real world” and at the University. We are all connected, and we all have opinions and beliefs that affect how we act, whether we know it or not. For most people, Wesleyan is a hyper-liberal atmosphere where it feels like the far left is never far enough. This leads many students to conclude over their time here that they “became more conservative,” or discovered what they “really believe.” Conversely, we all know someone who has become substantially more radical in their beliefs over the course of their time at the University. I would argue that these phenomena stem from the same root: a confrontation with progressive thought that can be so new, foreign, and even scary that it profoundly changes us, whether immediately or over time, whether for better or worse. I would like to believe that people changing at a progressive school is a good thing, especially because I truly believe that this stems from genuine intellectual curiosity. However, we are also producing a new form of intolerance at Wesleyan that I hope will be merely a flash in the pan rather than the beginning of a new trend in the twenty-first century. As many prospective students like we once were descend upon campus for WesFest, we are reminded of our own hopes and preconceived notions of the University, and one of the most common ones is that it is an incredibly tolerant place. Although inclusion is part of the ethos of this school—as can be seen with our gender neutral bathrooms, African American Studies program, experimental artwork, and speech code—all of these cases are at the very least the partial result of grassroots student activism that worked to improve the status quo that was at one point, and in some ways still is, intolerant. The Is This Why movement is the latest form of a long line of racial justice campaigns on this campus that go back to the very origins of the American Civil Rights Movement, where even Wesleyan professors went down South to join the Freedom Riders. Wesleyan is still a school with a majority of white students, and there seems to be a large disparity between who appears on the University home page and who is valued as a member of the community. Another important aspect of tolerance to address is that of dissenting opinion at one of the most progressive schools in the country. While we should never tolerate hate speech, we must allow room for dissent in our political discourse on campus. In fact, we should encourage dissent so that our views can be stronger. Yet in practice, the tendency of students trying to “out-left” each other when weighing in on topics on social media or even in the classroom can lead students who haven’t made up their minds or who have a different opinion to remain in silence. This is not the kind of civic engagement we should be producing at a school of this quality. Of course there are historical narratives that are important to keep in mind regarding more conservative opinions that are more predominant in the United States, such as white-supremacy, male-supremacy, heteronormativity, and the countless others that we ought to learn more about while we are here. This is not, however, an excuse to shelter oneself from dissenting opinion during one’s time at the University. Many students already cannot shelter themselves from societal forces that are supposed to be absent at Wesleyan, such as being asked to present one’s student ID as a student of color when using University transportation, or being asked where one is “really from” as a student of color. Although Wesleyan is a bubble to a large extent, it is never separated from the world or the U.S. in its problems. This unease with what is and what ought to be, with the past and present, with off-campus and on-campus, is what drives the intellectual curiosity that makes our school so great. Our campus debates do not always have two sides, with sometimes three, four, or more viewpoints being represented on issues ranging from Israeli-Palestinian relations to cultural appropriation in program housing. As our vocabularies grow with words that will be unrecognizable to our friends and family at Thanksgiving dinner, we also grow as people during our time here thanks to the deep reservoirs of emotion and knowledge within each of member of the Wesleyan community. While I’m not promising a complete identity crisis or makeover to come with one’s degree from the University, I do believe that the coupling of this school’s culture with its intellectual rigor will drive you to always want to learn more, and to hopefully never settle for what is, choosing instead to question the underpinnings of whatever is in front of you, and to put the pieces back together in a better way as you move forward. So the next time you walk by the names and faces of our alumni, whether in the athletic center or in your department’s senior theses, take a moment to engage with their legacy to remind yourself that they never stopped questioning, and neither should you.

"A Dead Electorate: The Case for an American Monarchy","2016-04-18","by Matthew Finkel, Contributing Writer","When Benjamin Franklin left Independence Hall after the Second Drafting, he was approached by a woman on the street. The woman said, “Mr. Franklin, what manner of government have you bequeathed us?” And Franklin replied, “A republic, madam, if you can keep it.” The Founding Fathers viewed democracy as something to be earned and then vigorously defended. Election by the masses, a daring gambit at the time, could only be pulled off with the backing of a politically engaged, educated, and responsible electorate. The system would only work if all citizens performed their civic duties to the fullest, schooling themselves on the most pressing issues facing the union and casting an informed vote accordingly. These vaunted ideals and lofty goals make it all the more painful to admit that Americans have forfeited their right to Benjamin Franklin’s republic. The Great Experiment has failed. The American public today is a far cry from the model electorate envisioned by the Framers, as evidenced by the country’s massive civic literacy crisis. Americans are woefully unequipped to make the kinds of nuanced voting decisions that a modern democracy demands. Whether and to what extent this failure is attributable to poor education and general political apathy is difficult to pin down, but the statistics behind flagging civic literacy are as compelling as they are disturbing. According to the Associated Press, only one in four Americans can name a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment. Most Americans believe their taxes are rising when they are actually falling, are unable to name the current vice president, and can’t clearly differentiate between most presidential candidates. The gap between what voters know and what they need to know will only widen as the workings of the government become more complex and civic education flatlines. If Americans can’t be bothered to learn even the most rudimentary facts about the federal budget, how can they be expected to make sound fiscal decisions? If they can’t find Afghanistan on a map, much less explain why the country waged a war there, how can the voting public possibly navigate an issue as complex as a rising China or a nuclear treaty? The unfortunate answer is that they probably can’t. In the latest ISI citizenship report, 51 percent of the country couldn’t pass the basic civic literacy examination required of incoming citizens. Not only are Americans not qualified to be voters, but apparently most of them aren’t even qualified to be Americans. America’s failings as a democracy don’t end there because in addition to being shockingly uninformed, the average citizen doesn’t even show up to vote. Attendance for House and Senate elections is appalling, with voter turnout for congressional races at its lowest point since 1942. The trend toward lethargy in national elections is just as pronounced. In the 1880 presidential election between James Garfield and Winfield Hancock, voter turnout was nearly 80 percent, and the single biggest issue in that race was the partial demonetization of silver. The most recent presidential election centered around some of the most pressing and vital political issues the country has faced in recent history: rallying after a recession, the budget deficit, a potentially nuclear Iran, the Affordable Care Act, and two full-scale land wars. Voter turnout barely broke 50 percent and the youth turnout was about 10 points lower. Demonetizing silver not being much of a bodice-ripper when compared to the threat of a nuclear winter, American voter engagement seems to have slumped somewhat since its heyday. Voters are completely disengaged from the political process and have abdicated their responsibility as citizens in a democracy. Statistics suggest that Americans don’t know the first thing about the country they live in or the policies they support, yet they are entrusted with electing the most important governing body in the world. In a decade of historic importance, turnout is at an equally historic low. Fear, ignorance, and misinformation dominate a political arena bereft of reason and intellect because the voting public can’t be trusted to read up on the issues or cast a ballot. A return to the monarchy probably isn’t in the cards, but when faced with an electorate that could seemingly only be drawn to the voting booth in the event of an alien invasion, leadership by heredity doesn’t seem like such an awful alternative.

"Barrier to Dialogue: On the Negative Effects of the Apartheid Wall","2016-04-25","by Grace Rubin, Contributing Writer","As a politically active, Jewish Zionist, my opinions differ from what seem to be popular opinions on campus, and I want to express my disappointment with our community when I saw the Israeli apartheid wall display last week. When I Googled the word “apartheid,” every definition I found described the history of racial segregation in South Africa between 1950 and 1991. In none of the definitions did I find any reference to Israel, Palestine, or the occupation. This indicates that the Israeli occupation of the West Bank is not defined as apartheid; rather I define it as an unfortunate product of Palestinian terrorism against Israeli civilians. This incident has made it more apparent to me that Wesleyan is not always true to the values it proclaims to hold dear, specifically inclusion and diversity, which makes me question the acceptance I previously felt here. I want to distinguish between Judaism and Zionism. Judaism is a religion with a long history of oppression and an inspiring reputation of overcoming adversity. Zionism is the belief that Israel should, and has the right to, exist as a Jewish state. Not every Jew is a Zionist and not every Zionist is a Jew. I happen to be both. My connection to the land of Israel is deeply rooted in my religious upbringing as well as in my personal journey of self-definition. My experiences traveling there have been religious, spiritual, and intellectually stimulating. I respect the decisions of anyone who identifies as a Jew and speaks against Israel, but personally, because I cannot separate my Judaism from my Zionism, the apartheid wall display struck me as a hate-filled personal attack. Wesleyan is supposed to be a place of inclusion, but the display felt like it was meant to ostracize certain community members. I feared the return of this display because I remember seeing it in the lobby of Olin last year when I was a freshman. Coming from a community of mostly pro-Israel Jews, I had never been exposed to so many people who shared such an opposing viewpoint. When I saw the Israel apartheid display last year I was shocked. I saw it as an insensitive and dramatic representation of a complicated issue, which only stood to spread hate. As much as this display upset me again this year, I was surprised that my reaction was less intense. That fact that my view changed so dramatically is of concern. Have I become so desensitized by hate speech against Israel that this no longer shocks me? What does it say about our campus climate that someone like me, a Jewish Zionist, no longer finds such fault with the same presentation? This year the display had a new addition, which a connection between Israel and Ferguson, Missouri. The display read, “From Ferguson to Palestine, Occupation is a Crime.” This artificial connection is offensive and completely nonsensical. Ferguson is experiencing civil unrest due to discrimination and violence perpetrated by police forces against African Americans. Although the display’s comparison between Ferguson and Palestine was not directly related to Israel’s treatment of its black population, this potential comparison is especially unfair considering that Israel does have its own minority population, Ethiopian Jews, and has put significant effort into incorporating Ethiopian Jewry into Israeli society. During the 1980s and 1990s, the Israeli government sent the Israel Defense Forces on numerous covert missions to bring Ethiopian Jewish refugees to Israel. They were given places to live and were taught the Hebrew language so they could be incorporated into Israeli society. To this day, no other country in the world has ever conducted a rescue mission of this nature and scale. The military occupation of the West Bank by Israeli security forces began due to the tremendous increase in suicide bombings in Israel during the first and second Palestinian intifadas in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The terrorists perpetrating these crimes against innocent civilians were entering Israel from the West Bank. The security forces remain in place currently to protect those living in Israel, but in Ferguson, Missouri the police forces seem to lack this protective intention. Comparing the disturbing racism in Ferguson to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank delegitimizes any racially based argument against Israel, both by ignoring Israel’s efforts to rescue the endangered Jewish population of Africa, and by rejecting the country’s basic right to self defense. The accusation that Israel is an apartheid state is easily refuted when compared to the realities of apartheid South Africa. For example, in South Africa, blacks had specific areas in which they were allowed to live. To my knowledge, in Israel, Arabs are permitted to live anywhere they choose. Arabs are an integrated part of Israeli society and share the same rights as every Jewish citizen. There are Arab doctors, police officers, army commanders, Supreme Court justices, and parliament members. In apartheid South Africa all of this would have been not only illegal but also unfathomable. Israel is by no means the perfect society. There is still discrimination against Arabs in Israeli society but so too is there discrimination against people of color in the United States, not to mention the recent eruption of anti-Semitism in Europe. For those who condemn the mistreatment of Palestinians in the West Bank, it is important to note that most of the Palestinians living in the West Bank are under the administration of the Palestinian Authority. Some also refer to Gaza as “occupied territory” when in fact the Israeli military “disengaged” from Gaza in 2005. The Palestinians living in Gaza are ruled by Hamas, an internationally recognized terrorist organization. All of this is to say that while it is true that the Palestinian people suffer injustice, it is most often not at the hands of the Israeli government. Finally, and perhaps most disconcerting to me, is the decision to present this display during WesFest, a time when our campus is full of prospective students and families. It is important to note that the display was outside of Usdan, a high-traffic area, rather than inside Olin as it was last year. The apartheid wall reflects poorly on our campus and sends a message of hatred in the presence of our visitors. I am hurt by the rejection I feel now, but I value the emphasis on free speech at Wesleyan. It would benefit our campus to engage in productive dialogues about how we can improve the lives of those living in the Middle East while not alienating members of our community. I look forward to discussions about Israel and Palestine without the interference of hate. Rubin is a member of the class of 2018."
"Women of Color House Hosts Period Party","2016-05-02","by Hyunji Ward, Assistant News Editor","On Saturday, April 30, Women of Color House hosted a Period Party in celebration of the Menstrual Cycle Product Drive. The drive, which has been going on all month on campus, collected menstrual cycle product donations for the homeless community in Middletown. The drive was sponsored by Womanist House, Women of Color House, Community Engagement House, International House, Sign Language House, The Bayit, Asian/Asian American House, Women of Color Collective, Adolescent Sexual Health Awareness, the Wesleyan Doula Project, the Planned Parenthood Chapter, RhoEp and W.A.G.E. The Facebook page promoting the event reads: “Menstrual Cycles should be celebrated! Not stigmatized, silenced, or shamed.” Attendees of the party were offered pizza from Mondo, as well as other refreshments. In addition, the Gender Resource Center board supplied an oversized pad and an oversized tampon, crafted out of cotton balls and poster board, that the partygoers were encouraged to decorate. The organizers stated that they would likely be put on display somewhere central on campus. House Manager of Womanist House, and one of the organizers of the party and drive, Michele Ko ’16, commented on the reasoning behind throwing the Period Party. “I think the idea was that people would come in and out, get to know each other, have good food and good desserts,” Ko said. “People are talking about periods and menstrual cycles and different products that they use.” The weather was sunny and warm, and people directly involved in the drive, or who were members of one or more of the groups sponsoring the event, sat in the backyard of Women of Color House socializing and enjoying the refreshments. Ko later pointed to other motivations that led to having the party, such as getting more donations to the drive, which students were doing both in the form of cash, and through the app Venmo. By looking up the profile @MCProductDrive, students were able to transfer money from their bank accounts directly to the cause. “I think [another] main idea was to get more donations, so people have been bringing more donations or Venmo-ing us,” Ko said. “This is also a celebration for us, because a lot of people here right now are the organizers of the drive, so it’s cool to share food and hang out.” Jennifer Gagné ’19 said she was made aware of the party through her connections with residents of Womanist House and Women of Color House. She also saw the drive as a productive way for students, like herself, with a surplus of points at the end of the year, to spend them. “I’ve donated probably five different packages…whenever I have points or am at WesShop, I buy pads and just donate,” Gagné said. “As someone who does have periods, they are expensive. People need pads, you can’t just turn off your period.” Another student at the party, Sarah Lurie ’17, a resident of Womanist House, also shared her thoughts on the drive. “I think the drive is super important,” Lurie said. “Because [having your period is] one of the most inconvenient things…. Imagine having your period if you’re homeless, especially if you don’t have any menstrual products.” The drive is continuing through the end of the year in order to collect as many donations as possible. Aside from using Venmo, students can still contribute to the drive by dropping off products at the designated donation bins around campus, located at Womanist House (44 Brainerd), Women of Color House (227 Pine), Community Engagement House (28 Lawn), International House (151 Church), Sign Language House (64 Lawn), 72A Home, 264 Court, and 34 Fountain."
"A Coachable Moment: Bringing Transparency to Campus Sexual Misconduct","2016-09-01","by Emma Solomon, Opinion Editor","The classic phrase of coaches from Little League dads to Bill Belichick is “We have a target on our back.” Usually, this line is meant to both incite grandiose notions of stardom while also excusing a potential loss as the result of other teams specifically gunning for them. Recently, this sports cliché has taken on additional meaning in collegiate athlete settings; not only does the proverbial bullseye rest on individual teams, but it is now supposedly placed on men’s college sports as an institution. The notion of the target on the back has become reappropriated by schools, athletes, and coaches alike as an explanation for the link that has been drawn between sexual assaults (both allegations and convictions) and male collegiate athletes. I know of many coaches who have met their significant other through college athletics, and perhaps this leads to a shared idea that intra-team fraternizing will inevitably lead to long-term and healthy relationships. Alas, as both NARPs and athletes know, postgame celebrity and congratulatory drinking does not a lasting courtship make.  I am proud to be friends with many respectful, intelligent, and hugely talented athletes at the University. I was also one of two female members of the men’s varsity rowing team, which has allowed me significant insight and a distinct perspective into the complex inner workings of a varsity-level team. Additionally, my long-term boyfriend plays soccer at a different Little Three school, and his recounting of experiences offers an additional resource and ethos. I do not believe that sports are inherently bad, or make people so, and I remain somewhat skeptical that a so-called “male athletic culture” is solely responsible for the actions of all male athletes.    Although being a liberal arts institution, and a notably progressive one at that, does not by any means exempt us from harmful cultural attitudes toward women and sex, I recognize that our liberal bubble offers valuable protection from a relatively harsher global atmosphere. While most University students at least recognize that sexual assault in any form is horrible and indicative of underlying systemic issues, the current prevention strategies and post-trauma training continue to be discussed under the thick cover of euphemisms and a thin veil of discomfort.  A good coach is one that is invested in fitness and finesse and final scores; a great coach is one who cares about the game, the squad, but most importantly about the individuals that actually make up their team. At the very least, a college coach should be not only a leader, but also an observant and relevant presence, both on and off the field. Each year, both the head coach and student-athlete must sign the University’s Department of Physical Education and Athletics Athlete Contract Form, which states its mission as the following: “Along with the opportunity to participate in athletics it is the student’s responsibility to conduct oneself in a manner that supports the team’s goals and behave in a manner that will reflect well on your team, your coach and Wesleyan.” This contract details the promises of the athlete to refrain from violating policies relating to everything from alcohol and drugs to hazing to social media presentation.  Additionally, in signing this contract, the student-athlete waives the right to privacy with respect to their grades, agreeing to “allow my coach to have access to my academic records so he/she can accurately discuss my performance with me.” The publicity of a student’s college grades is an unsurprisingly contentious issue, and the most recent regulations outlined by The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) have purposefully and strictly denied guardians (tuition-paying or not) access to their child’s academic records. A concerned parent may wonder why their little Jimmy has racked up so many charges at “Forest City” while demonstrating zero interest or proof of Environmental Science engagement, but no amount of panicked calls to President Michael Roth himself will allow them to see his grades and courses. Yet, for a coach who wants to know whether a top scorer needs a little…tutoring…in Intro Econ, he can easily access current course grades. In addition to their access to personal academic information, coaches are made aware of various other highly private issues such as medical conditions, family emergencies, or other significant personal issues that may require skipping practice. There is nothing inherently wrong with coaches seeing their players’ grades (athletes are often reminded that they are called student-athletes and not athlete-students for a reason) or being privy to other exclusive knowledge, and I mention it only to highlight the clear discrepancy in information availability.  A more morally comprehensive and socially respectable contract for student-athletes would explicitly grant permission for coaches to be alerted when an athlete has formally had a sexual misconduct charge filed against them. An alert would simply notify, without judgment or accusal, a relevant adult figures that someone under their jurisdiction may or may not have committed anything from online harassment to multiple-assailant rape.  Given awareness of this information, a coach may choose to look skeptically but silently at the accused student: A subsequent “family emergency” that is suddenly requiring them to miss practices may be viewed from a coach’s more informed perspective. Instead, the coach may take the opportunity to have a discussion with the team about issues relating to sex and relationships. Predictably, some coaches will take no conscious action at all, but their ears may unintentionally perk up and be more attuned to the hushed conversations occurring between drills or at the back of the bus. Informed coaches may be inspired to nominate and encourage team leaders who talk respectfully about their girlfriends and/or female friends in general and may discipline the guys who recall a win by discussing how they “raped Midd last year.” In the current college climate, the only thing worse than an over-controlling coach is a lazy one who believes that his players’ actions off the field are beyond their pay grade or goal-oriented expertise.  A foreseeable counterargument from the athletic community might inappropriately utilize anti-death penalty or anti-mandatory minimum rhetoric and discuss the repercussions that may arise from potentially false allegations. Unlike the death penalty or jail sentences—which, among other issues, are disproportionately applied to men and women of color—however, alerting a coach that a member of the team is the alleged perpetrator in an active investigation with the Title IX office offers little to none of the irreversibility factor implicit in jail time or lethal injection.  From a player/coach standpoint, the worst-case scenario potentially arising from this alert system would be that a falsely accused athlete suffers from increased speculation by a coach. In consideration of this demographic’s deserved reputation vis-à-vis sexual misconduct, a coach’s increased attention might be far from harmful. Roxane Gay, in her acclaimed book “Bad Feminist,” offers a wise perspective on the false accusation issue (or really lack thereof): “I give the victim the benefit of the doubt when it comes to allegations of rape and sexual abuse. I choose to err on that side of caution. This does not mean I am unsympathetic of the wrongly accused, but if there are sides to be chosen, I am on the side of the victim.” Furthermore, even if every player on every sports team was falsely accused (an extreme and statistically improbable hypothetical), a greater focus on sexual crimes amongst coaches might act as a needed panoptic reminder for student-athletes. At worst, these hypothetical players might gain valuable insight into the investigation process and be further deterred from engaging in any sort of behavior that would again land them in the midst of a process designed to protect women from a violent culture that sports heroes have perpetuated and celebrated.   If coaches want to take pride in their team’s achievements, they need to step up to the plate and start taking responsibility for the other actions of those same valuable students. If they’re going to spend six days a week yelling about “crushing the back end” or “stealing third base” or “just because there’s a goalie doesn’t mean you can’t score,” then they also need to start speaking up a lot louder and a little less euphemistically about sexual responsibility."
"This Is Why Campaign Ends, Raises $482 Million","2016-09-05","by Natasha Nurjadin, News Editor","Screenshot c/o thisiswhy.wesleyan.edu On June 30, the University ended This Is Why, its most successful fundraising campaign, with over $482 million raised. The campaign began in 2007, and since then nearly 80 percent of alumni having donated to the campaign. Parents of University students have donated $51 million. The closing amount raised of $482 million exceeded the original goal of $400 million. The three goals of the This Is Why were to increase funding for access, inquiry, and impact. This was done through donating to financial aid, new resources to recruit and train faculty, and improving access to internships and research stipends. “The THIS IS WHY campaign raised over $274 million to make a Wesleyan education possible for motivated, talented students who could not otherwise afford to attend without financial assistance or without incurring heavy debt,” the This Is Why campaign website reads. A portion of the funds, $145 million, was used in the form of new resources to recruit and train faculty, in pursuit of the inquiry goal. These resources were also given to both student and faculty endeavors in other programs, including the Allbritton Center for the Study of Public Life, the Center for the Humanities, the College of the Environment, the Patricelli Center for Social Entrepreneurship, and the Shapiro Creative Writing Center. Another portion of the money raised, $61 million, went toward the impact goal, which aimed to deepen students’ opportunities outside academics, including internships and community engagement. This came in the form of internship stipends and research funding for students. “Internships, service learning, and related research are of enormous value to Wesleyan students, but there are financial constraints,” the This Is Why campaign website reads. “Wesleyan alumni all over the world want to offer internships, for example, but there are limited funds for stipends that would enable students to accept them.” The campaign marked the launching of four new interdisciplinary colleges within the University, including those in Film, East Asian Studies, Environmental Studies, and Integrative Sciences. Similarly, the campaign launched the Center for Pedagogical Innovation, which is dedicated to inspiration, incubation, and dissemination of pedagogical innovations. The campaign also helped in the renovation of Boger Hall. In June, the last month of the campaign, $1 million was added through the $1 Million Cardinal Challenge. John Usdan ’80, Chair of the This Is Why campaign and Trustee Emeritus, donated $500 for every gift made to the campaign. All donations from the challenge were donated to the This Is Why campaign. The University also had its most successful fiscal year of fundraising so far, raising over $79 million in gifts and pledges. The campaign ended on June 16 with a celebratory gala at Grand Central Terminal in New York City. Campaign leaders honored included Joshua Boger ’83, Alan Dachs ’70, Ellen Jewett ’81, Donna Morea ’76, and Usdan. “I am overwhelmed by the generosity of the extended Wesleyan family during the course of the THIS IS WHY fundraising campaign,” University President Michael Roth ’78 said in a statement to the University newsletter. “In traveling around the world and speaking to alumni and parents about why they choose to make a Wesleyan education their cause, I have been so impressed by the loyalty and ambition of this community….I have been able to describe to [alumni] how their gifts to Wesleyan enable us to strengthen the things they care so much about. This being Wesleyan, our supporters are not primarily interested in replicating the past. Instead, they tend to want to recreate the conditions of change that have allowed our University to have a powerfully transformative impact on its students.”"
"New Muslim Chaplain Hopes to Increase Interfaith Relations and Awareness of Islam","2016-09-15","by Natasha Nurjadin, News Editor","Following the departure of Kaiser Aslam, the University has hired Sami Abdul Aziz as the new University Muslim Chaplain. Also known as Imam Sami, he began working at the University in August and hopes to focus and create events dealing with issues of Islamophobia and interfaith relations between different religions. As chaplain, his role is to facilitate religious services on campus, as well as provide pastoral counseling to all students, regardless of religious beliefs. “If somebody on campus is of another faith, doesn’t matter which, I’m also there to listen to them,” Aziz said. Aziz emphasizes that although he focuses on Muslim events, everyone is invited to all events, including weekly Friday prayers and support groups. The support groups are created for Muslim students to have a safe space and to interact with one another. Speaking to the political climate in the country with respect to Islam, Aziz highlighted the importance of openness in the campus community. “Being a Muslim in America can be difficult right now, [as] we are minorities not only in religious group, but also a minority group in the color of our skin,” Aziz said. “There is a lot of fear in the Muslim community regarding the political situation, [such as] what is going to happen. Is Islamophobia going to increase, and are people going to judge us based on our religion? There is some of that fear here among students on campus, and I want to help them be comfortable and let them know that this campus is open to you.” As Aziz works only part time at the University, he discussed his efforts throughout Connecticut in spreading awareness of Islam as a whole. He is the founder and CEO of the Common Grounds Services Institute. Through the institute, he travels to churches, libraries, and schools, educating members of these institutions on a variety of topics, including ISIS, Islamophobia, and women in Islam. He has also hosted joint services in churches, giving talks on the relationship between Islam and Jesus Christ. Aziz hopes to host an event at the University on the difference between ISIS and Islam. Interfaith relations are also something on which Aziz focuses, as he works with the on-campus Protestant, Catholic, and Jewish leaders in hosting interfaith events and exploring ways that they can work together. Aziz is also a member of the Bloomfield Interfaith Council. “I would like to see more interfaith collaboration events, maybe we talk about our faiths and what’s similar,” Aziz said. “The similarities are amazing between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. We have so many things in common that we don’t have an excuse to divide ourselves, in my opinion.” As Monday was Eid Al-Adha, a sacred Muslim holiday, Aziz has already hosted six events on campus. He hopes to also create a Muslim film series and bring in more Muslim singers and theater performances. Aziz is also working with Bon Appétit, the campus food service provider, in developing meals during Muslim religious holidays. Currently, Bon Appétit has special meals during other religious holidays, but not during Muslim ones. Aziz, who has also worked as a prison and hospital chaplain, noted that his time at the University has been enjoyable not just because of the campus environment, but also the welcoming atmosphere he has encountered. “For the first two weeks, I would walk around campus and not say who I was and people would think I’m a student,” Aziz said. “It showed me that people are willing to talk to me regardless of my beard or skin color. They would approach me. That was a nice feeling.” Aziz joins the line of Muslim chaplains who have served the University in one of the oldest Muslim chaplain programs in America. “I would say 80 percent of college campuses don’t have a Muslim chaplain,” Aziz said. “It’s been many years, probably a decade. I really appreciate that.” He also noted that he appreciated how the University provides budgeting for events. Aziz connected his experiences as chaplain now to how he felt in college and high school and how he used to be shy about practicing his religion openly. “Maybe some students don’t feel as open about their religion on campus, but I want them to know that no one is going to judge you. They should have the right, and Wesleyan does give you that right to be open,” Aziz said. “I want to provide more programming to make the Muslim kids feel more comfortable.” John Hossain, a graduate student at the University, admires Aziz for his engagement with students. “I’ve found the new Muslim Chaplain, Imam Sami, to be deeply invested in his students,” Hossain wrote in an email to The Argus. “He’s put significant effort into reinvigorating Muslim life on campus, for both practicing and non-practicing students, and providing a close-knit and diverse community for us to support one another. I’m hoping he builds momentum with this over the next couple of years and increases the visibility of Muslims at Wes.” Alicia Strong ’18, President of the Muslim Student Association, also discussed her confidence in working with Aziz in the upcoming school year. She had also previously collaborated with him in the wider Connecticut community. “He is very friendly and genuine and I know he’ll be able to reach Muslim students of varying religiosity,” Strong wrote in an email to The Argus. “I know him from my work in the Connecticut Muslim community and he is incredibly motivated. I’m particularly fond of his work educating people about Islam and his interfaith work. Hopefully the Muslim Student Association can have a bigger presence on campus with his help.”"
"University Releases Annual Sexual Violence Report and Next Steps for Equity and Inclusion","2016-09-19","by Camille De Beus, Assistant News Editor","The University’s Annual Sexual Violence Report and Next Steps for Equity and Inclusion was released in a campus-wide email on Friday, Sept. 16. Written by Vice President for Equity & Inclusion/Title IX Officer Antonio Farias, the annual update discussed the 2015 sexual assault report and continued measures to prevent sexual assault; the formation of a new Equity & Inclusion Steering Committee; and a new program to increase faculty and staff diversity. “The next steps to promote equity and prevent sexual assault include infusing that language and information into as many conversations as possible,” Farias wrote in an email to The Argus. “Critical to preventing all forms of sexual misconduct including harassment, stalking, intimate partner violence, and sexual assault is continued conversation and preventative education.” Although there was a decrease in reports of sexual violence at the University in 2015, there has been an increase in the number of initiatives to prevent sexual violence. “In addition to the online Haven program for all incoming students, we are working to have as many students participate in Bystander Intervention as possible,” Farias wrote. “The Residence Life staff have been provided more resources than in the past in terms of both training and passive education to expand the conversation to include consent and communication as well as healthy relationships. WSA is currently implementing the No Red Zone campaign, which we applaud and with whom we will be working in partnership.” Farias expressed concern over the decreased reports of sexual violence over the last year. “It takes significant time to change the societal culture we are a part of,” Farias wrote. “While seemingly counterintuitive, increased numbers are a positive sign that the climate for survivors is getting better as they feel supported enough to come forward and seek services as well as adjudication of their cases.” President Michael Roth agreed with Farias’s sentiment regarding fewer sexual assaults reported. “We see this in many schools around the country, some schools have no sexual assault, or so they say, which just means nobody’s reporting,” Roth said. “So there’s no comfort in having high reports, or high numbers, or high incidents. It’s good that people feel they can report, but it’s terrible that incidents are taking place. We continue to work with student groups that tell us how we need to a better job supporting people who have been assaulted, who’ve reported assaults. We continue to get advice about how we can have a more equitable procedure that finds people who are responsible, that deals with them appropriately, and also finds that some people aren’t responsible, people who have been accused. And then last is to raise awareness and create programs like the Bystander Intervention Program and others that reduce the likelihood of assault taking place.” Another way in which the University is hoping to improve processes and procedures for sexual violence survivors is by ensuring that everyone has access to information for reporting and support services; helping survivors connect to support and resources without speaking to multiple people; and having a faculty and staff that know how to respond to information related to sexual misconduct. “Constructive criticism is key to improving support at the same time we continue to shift a societal culture of disrespect and violence,” Farias wrote. “If you find yourself not thinking about how sexual violence has an impact on your life—that, dear Wesleyan community member, is your starting point—get educated and use that incredible brain and empathic heart to understand how your ‘out of sight, out of mind’ attitude contributes to the problem and more importantly, how you are the potential embodiment of the solution.” According to Roth, the University also signed an accord with some groups in Middletown to make it easier to work with the criminal justice system when sexual assaults take place. “Many students choose not to go to the criminal justice system because it can be a very challenging path on top of the awfulness of the event itself,” Roth said. “I’d like to see students who feel that that’s the appropriate path, to have the University’s support to do that with confidence and support. I don’t know there’s really more we can do, but just to make sure people are aware of the choices that they have. So in cases of rape, we can expel the student, but the criminal justice system can put that person in jail. In cases of rape, I’d like to see that person in jail, but that is up to the survivor of the assault, and we are conscious of the fact that it is up to that person if she or he wants to go ahead. Raising awareness of the issues so that students who are not directly involved in the incident can play a positive role in decreasing the likelihood of incidents taking place. Whether that’s men, women, everybody can play a role in stopping assaults from happening.” Additionally, the update described the new Equity & Inclusion Steering Committee that will be building on the work of the Equity Task Force. “The steering committee will review last semesters work, take in continual feedback from students, faculty, and staff, and begin the process of developing a timely work flow designed to address short, medium, and long term challenges to making Wesleyan a more equitable and inclusive educational environment for all,” Farias wrote. The Steering Committee will consist of the Vice President for Equity & Inclusion, the faculty vice chair, the WSA president, and the chair of the Board of Trustees Campus Affairs Committee. The committee is currently looking for volunteers to work with them. “We set up a Google form that lets the Wesleyan community members volunteer in areas where they feel they are best able to contribute,” Farias wrote. “No one on this campus has the luxury of loads of free time, so we’re asking you to prioritize your choices as I believe sweat equity is the catalyst for sustained change. So if you’re committed to change, step up and sign-up now.” The University is also implementing a new program for opportunity hires that will help increase faculty and staff diversity. “The Office for Equity & Inclusion is collaborating with both Human Resources and Academic Affairs to look at increasing the recruitment and retention of a diverse workforce,” Farias wrote. “Part of this collaboration includes review of current practices, revision of these practices as needed, listening to ideas from current faculty and staff, and brainstorming new and innovative ways of outreach for each search process. Institutionally, we’ve begun to see successful changes in faculty hiring over the past few years, and that’s just the start of a long-term process of seeking, developing, and mentoring our increasingly diverse workforce.” Though there is still much progress to be made surrounding sexual assault and discrimination, Farias is pleased by the members of the University community who are working to help end sexual assault and discrimination. “If I’m pleased with anything, it’s with the relentless energy and activism around the elimination of sexual violence and identity-based discrimination that shows up in the overwhelming volunteerism of students, staff and faculty who serve on the Title IX Policy, Education, Core, Athletics, Student committees,” Farias wrote. “I’m also pleased with the WSA starting the year with the [No] Red Zone project. The reason we went with One Policy toward all forms of identity-based discrimination is because we want to see this level of engagement manifest to eliminate all forms of discrimination. My hope and the work I plan on for the coming year has to do with engaging in reparative work across all our communities, and encouraging the ‘generosity of spirit,’ that is one of our core values and should be our guiding beacon through whatever storms we encounter.”"
"Trustees Convene in Official and Private Meetings","2016-09-26","by Jake Lahut, Features Editor","The Argus was told to direct all communication with The Board through the president's office while trustees met with students and faculty over the weekend. c/o Joe Mabel The University’s board of trustees convened over the weekend amongst each other and student representatives in break-out sessions available only to a select group of invited student and faculty representatives. A relatively unknown body to most students, the board has wide-reaching powers beyond any administrators, and even the president himself, and is endowed by the University’s charter. The Argus was unable to speak with trustees over the weekend because their meetings were private events, according to Lisa LaPlant, Executive Assistant to the Chief of Staff, who told The Argus that all communication with members of the board must go through the President’s Office. Specifically, requests were to be made to William Holder, Director of University Communications. The University’s Manager of Media and Public Relations, Lauren Rubenstein, is currently on maternity leave. Rubenstein is normally South College’s liaison with The Argus, and there is currently no interim replacement for her title within University Communications. Holder did not respond to multiple emails requesting media availability with trustees over the weekend. The selection of which trustees would be allowed to speak with The Argus was left to Holder’s discretion, though some suggested preferences were included in an initial email. Requests for interviews with selected trustees were made just before 6:30 p.m. on Saturday outside of a board event in the Career Center, where LaPlant directed The Argus’s requests to Holder after forbidding entry to the event. Requests to Holder, following LaPlant’s suggestion, were made via email at 6:33 p.m. Holder responded 38 hours later on Monday morning in an email to The Argus. “It’s not feasible to arrange interviews with trustees on the spur of the moment,” Holder wrote. “We can talk more about this, but in the meantime, if you have specific questions about the trustee meeting this weekend, send them to me and I’ll see what I can do.” Follow up questions on when the latest report on the Board of Trustees’ decisions will be released and why all communication with trustees must go through the President’s office were not answered as of this article’s publication late Monday evening. Because the requests for press availability were made on short-notice—and out of respect for LaPlant’s requests and orders—The Argus has not attempted to contact trustees in person, by phone, nor via email since speaking with LaPlant. Outside of their official meeting, trustees engaged in several break-out sessions with members of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) and attended private events with invited members of the University community. Members of the WSA were able to speak with trustees about student concerns, including the Resource Center suggested by the Is This Why movement, social spaces on campus, and general education requirements, according to Nila Ravi ’18, Vice President of the WSA. “The board thinks more long-term than President Roth or members of the cabinet do,” Ravi said. Because of that focus, Ravi sees the WSA and its members’ engagement with the board as crucial to informing them of current student needs so that they can make better long-term decisions. “[Our suggestions] were mostly what a lot of students need on campus right now instead of in, [say], 50 years,” she said. Much of this dialogue between student representatives and board members occurred during the Board Retreat, where ideas for the University’s future were exchanged. “The Board Retreat was just an introduction in setting the tone for this upcoming school year and what the Board wants to focus on,” Ravi said. “So there were a lot of full-board sessions that talked about Wesleyan more broadly and plans for the future. And then there were some dinners and games for the board to interact with members of Roth’s cabinet and things like that.” Ravi participated in several sessions along with other members of the Wesleyan community outside of the WSA. “The student reps were there for all of the board sessions, and there were faculty reps as well,” she said. “The only part we weren’t allowed to be at was a closed board session with President Roth, and then there’s a separate session with just the board of trustees.” According to the University’s charter—which was last amended in 2003—the President of the University must be one of the 29 to 33 members of the board, where Roth currently serves alongside his duties in South College. Ravi had a positive experience in her interactions with trustees. She found them receptive to collaboration with WSA representatives. “It was pretty good,” she said. “The board members that I interacted with were really open to student input, and we tried to come up with different things that I think were relevant to students right now. We’ll be writing a report of that in the near future.” Members of the board come from a wide range of professions and ages, with the Wesleyan experience tying them all together. From Kennedy Odede ’12—the youngest trustee who has garnered worldwide acclaim for his community organizing in Africa after coming to the University from Kibera, the largest urban slum in Kenya—to mainstay campus names like Adam Usdan ’83 and Andrew Brandon Gordon ’86, members of the board bring disparate experiences back to Middletown in an effort to preserve and improve elements like the campus culture and academic prowess. The board also has significant logistical burdens, such as electing the President of the University and determining the salaries of faculty members, according to the University’s charter. The board also has the power to determine and revise the University’s courses of study, along with its disciplinary procedures. The only mandatory meeting time for the board, according to the charter, is within 10 days of commencement. All other meetings are to be called by the Chair of the Board, Donna Morea ’76. Besides the President of the University, only trustees emeriti and the Chair of the Alumni Association or their delegate may be present for official board meetings. The charter also includes a section pertaining exclusively to conflicts of interest. If a potential conflict arises, trustees must disclose it to the board, and their vote may not be counted in the quorum of the meeting, though they are allowed to make their opinion on the matter known. The board was most recently reported to have voted to increase tuition and residential comprehensive fees by 3.3 percent for the 2016-17 academic year, according to a University blog post by Rubenstein. Tuition was set at $50,312 for all undergraduates, with room and board set at $13,950 for first-years and sophomores and $15,858 for juniors and seniors. Rubenstein contextualized the Board’s decision to raise tuition above the national CPI average for inflation as of the Feb. 27 meeting. “In order to continue supporting financial aid, as well to invest in high-quality faculty and innovative pedagogy and programs, the Board has adopted an increase modestly above the current inflation rate, and in line with our peers,” Rubenstein wrote. “As always, Wesleyan will meet the full demonstrated financial need of all admitted students. Recent initiatives have eliminated loans for our neediest students and lowered overall student debt to levels far below the national average.” The board’s most recent decisions, along with the WSA’s report on the Board Retreat, will be announced in the near future, though no firm dates have been publicly released."
"Students Look to Vote Amid Low Turnout","2016-10-03","by Ariel Adler, Contributing Writer","In less than 40 days, Americans will elect the next President of the United States. However, if past presidential elections are any indication, roughly 42 to 46 percent of eligible voters will not show up to vote on Election Day. Pew Research Center conducted a poll in 2012 showing that only 129.1 million of 241 million eligible voters cast their ballots when President Obama was re-elected, and the numbers have not varied significantly within the past 50 years, nor are they expected to change this election. Comparatively, approximately 54 to 58 percent of Americans who are eligible to vote (i.e. 18 and up, not convicted of a felony, etc.) will elect the next President of the United States. Only 38 percent of eligible voters between the ages of 18 and 24 cast their ballots in 2012, according to census data. This group of voters, known as “Millennials” or “Generation Y,” has the lowest voter turnout among all age groups, including Generation X, Baby Boomers, and The Silent Generation. Even so, low voter turnout is not a rare phenomenon for young voters who, in 1964, peaked at 51 percent in voter participation. When asked why young people have such an abysmal voting record, Jack Warren ’20 spoke to a perceived futility in voting. “They feel like their vote doesn’t matter,” Warren said. “The electoral system is incredibly flawed…It’s very difficult to feel like your vote matters when you know that, no matter if you vote or not, your state’s going blue.” Oftentimes, the presidential election comes down to certain swing states like Florida and Ohio. For Warren, one vote may not decide the election, but each vote is important, especially if more and more people don’t vote. “If everyone adopted that mindset of ‘my vote doesn’t matter,’ then that wouldn’t be true,” he said. Co-Chair of the Wesleyan Democrats Simon Korn ’17 contends a similar argument. “Even if you don’t personally affect the outcome of the presidential election, or any election…you still should vote,” he said. “People who run for office spend lots of time and lots of money figuring out who votes, why they vote, and how best to represent you….If we as Millennials consistently vote in elections large and small, presidential, local, and state….People who run for office will take notice of that, and they will care about our interests.” In the 2012 presidential election, President Barack Obama received 67 percent of the youth vote, compared with Romney’s 30 percent, according to a study by Politico. In a study released days after President Obama secured his re-election, the Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University concluded the following: “If Governor Romney had won half of the youth vote, or if young voters had stayed home entirely, then Romney would have won instead of Obama.” Though the data itself includes figures from swing states like Florida, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Ohio, it nevertheless articulates the influence the youth vote can have on presidential elections. Despite nearly 54 percent of the millennial voter population not voting in the 2012 presidential election, the percentage that did vote guaranteed Obama another four years in office. Both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump recognize how integral the youth vote is to the success of their individual campaigns. This is especially evident when comparing Clinton’s agenda before and after winning the Democratic nomination; she absorbed much of Bernie Sanders’ rhetoric on the economy and education, hoping to reproduce the enthusiasm millennials felt toward Sanders during his campaign. In fact, according to census data the the Pew Research center has analyzed, millennials are now a bigger voting force than any other generation, including the Baby Boomers. This means millennials could likely sway the vote in either Clinton or Trump’s favor. If those two options are unsatisfactory, Kati Young ’19 has an alternative. “This is an election where third-party candidates have had the strongest backing they’ve had in a long time, so if you’re interested in stopping the two-party system, then this might be a great opportunity,” she said. Young developed on the potentially monumental effect the youth vote can have on the presidential election. “Too many people have sacrificed to give me the privilege to vote for me not to vote,” she said. Young references, among other things, the fight for women’s suffrage, which ultimately led to the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, but her statement encompasses all groups whose voices, at one point or another, were silenced as a result of unjust laws, discrimination, and prejudice. Local and state elections, though often overlooked, play an equally important role in civic engagement. In an article written in The Washington Post on May 9, 2013, it was revealed that “Congressional approval averaged 15 percent, the lowest in nearly four decades of Gallup polling. And yet, 90 percent of House Members and 91 percent of Senators who sought re-election won last November. By 2014, the incumbency rate increased, while Congress’ approval rating decreased. This correlates with an article released by The Washington Post on Nov. 10, 2014 presenting statistics that showed “voter turnout for the 2014 midterms was the lowest it’s been in any election cycle since World War II.” Furthermore, outside the United States, in countries where leaders are not elected by the populace or where it is dangerous to vote, people are risking their lives to procure and uphold their right to vote. In the 2014 Afghanistan presidential election, approximately 7 million people voted despite recent attacks “carried out by Taliban militants,” including one on “the Afghanistan’s election commission headquarters,” according to a report by The Washington Post. Nonetheless, some argue that it is too difficult to register to vote, or that the process of filling out an absentee ballot is confusing and tedious. College students, who make up a large majority of the youth population, struggle to find time to register to vote in between classes and extracurricular activities. The requirements for filling out an absentee ballot vary from state to state, so it can be challenging to find information on a college campus pertaining specifically to one’s home state. Fortunately, Wesleyan offers ample resources to make the process as simple as possible. On the Wesleyan Office of the Registrar webpage, students can find under “General Information” links to information about registering to vote in the state of Connecticut, filling out an absentee ballot, and checking your voter registration status. If the information on the webpage is insufficient, Korn disclosed that the Wesleyan Democrats, in addition to collaborating with the Wesleyan Republicans on voter registration events both prior to and on Election Day, have found a possible solution to the anxiety that accompanies the absentee voting application process. “We’re going to have people in Usdan telling students how to vote in their home state,” Korn said. “People are going to come up to us, and we’re going to help them out individually one by one. That’s the only way to do it.” If none of that works, Korn strongly suggests turning toward the Internet. “Just Google ‘How to vote absentee in my state,’” Korn said. “What’s more, once you type ‘How to vote in my state’ in the search bar, Google automatically provides a template of information with step-by-step instructions explaining how to vote absentee. The same goes for when you type in ‘How to register to vote.’” Or, eligible voters can go to http://www.canivote.org/ and select their state, and the webpage leads directly to the state’s voter registration site where citizens can learn about deadlines and necessary documentation. “When it comes down to it, people have to make the decision on their own to vote and who to vote for,” Korn said."
"Breaking Out of the Bubble: A Look into the Gap Year of Sydney Taylor-Klaus ’20","2016-10-03","by Nikhil Ghosh, Contributing Writer","c/o Sydney Taylor-Klaus Having spent almost a month at Wesleyan, the class of 2020 is quickly adjusting to the school climate and settling into the rhythm of balancing academics, extracurricular activities, and social events. As paper deadlines fly by and midterms approach, many students recall high school as the last time they had to take a test. Students who have taken gap years, however, have to look a bit further. Among them is Sydney Taylor-Klaus ’20. A 2015 graduate of The Paideia School in Atlanta, Ga., Taylor-Klaus spent the equivalent of two semesters traveling in New Zealand, Fiji, and Australia and volunteering on a permaculture farm in Nicaragua. The Argus sat down with Taylor-Klaus to hear about her experiences abroad, as well as her insights from the past year. When asked about her motivations for taking a gap year, Taylor-Klaus cited the need to separate her high school experience from college. “I wanted to break out of the routine of ‘school school school,’ and since college is really the beginning of the rest of your life, I wanted to take some time and figure out who I was before starting,” she explained. “I knew I could enter college more confident about who I am, but I also knew it was going to be a lot of work, so I decided to learn more about myself as a person.” More than five percent of Taylor-Klaus’s graduating class at The Paideia School opted to take a gap year, and she referenced her peers’ experiences as having helped her decision. “I knew as a freshman [in high school] that there were some students who took a year off and did really cool things,” Taylor-Klaus said. “During my junior year, my Ultimate [Frisbee] co-captain took a gap year, and I knew a lot of others who chose that path.” While Taylor-Klaus revealed her plans for a gap year to only a few of her classmates, she said she was pleased to receive their support. “Even though I didn’t talk about it a lot at school, when I finally told my friends about my plan, they were really supportive,” she said. “That was a really big help.” When planning out the finer points of her gap year, Taylor-Klaus searched for a cultural immersion trip that would take her abroad and engage her in community service. Opting not to take courses for credit, she signed up with Carpe Diem Education. Based in Portland, Ore., the company specializes in gap year programs and experiential education. Signing up for the Latitude Year program, Taylor-Klaus embarked on a 14-person, three-month trip to New Zealand, Fiji, and Australia. During the second semester of her gap year, Taylor-Klaus enrolled in a Focused Volunteer Placement (FVP) program, which allowed her to intern on a permaculture farm in Nicaragua through Project Bona Fide. “The essential project was applying permaculture principles to designing a piece of land for a hypothetical client,” she said. “We learned all about how these natural elements interact and about the strategies which promote sustainability and keep the Earth’s well-being as the first priority.” Discussing permaculture, Taylor-Klaus commented on the universal applications of the field. “It’s really a principle, or concept,” she said. “You can apply it to anything, like city planning, farming, or even which classes you take in college. For our purposes, we applied it to farming systems and structures, and agricultural design.” Taylor-Klaus also elaborated on how the study of permaculture opened her eyes to the cyclical processes of nature and how technology doesn’t have to work against or be at odds with the Earth’s natural balance. “Chickens are a great example,” she added. “They create manure that’s a great fertilizer for the soil and composting; they break down compost, produce eggs, food, and so much more. The food waste from the kitchen supports them, so you see the balance of elements supporting functions, and these functions supporting said elements. It’s multifunctional!” Balancing resources is another key concept that Taylor-Klaus learned and then utilized in her field work. “It’s a great way to use all of your natural resources, but not overtax them and have them run out,” she said. Though she had never previously considered working on a permaculture farm, Taylor-Klaus realized that her favorite portion of her New Zealand trip was working on an organic farm. Building water troughs, for example, helped her see more clearly the interconnectedness of nature. “While staying in a marae, or a Maori—an indigenous New Zealand population, that is—community, we toured another and saw how they planted native trees to rid surfaces of impacted soil and grass which caused a once-flowing river to become subterranean, and bring the river back over time,” she said. Taylor-Klaus was struck by the foresight of the Maori community and their determination to bring the Earth back to its true wealth of natural beauty. “My experiences on the group trip in New Zealand really helped determine where I would work during the FVP,” Taylor-Klaus said. “Because I had an affinity for manual labor and my interest in nature was there, my advisor strongly recommended the permaculture project. She recognized that it was a good fit, and I’m really glad that I ended up where I did.” Braving weeks of limited contact with her family and friends while thousands of miles from home, Taylor-Klaus truly embraced the hands-on approach to learning. “I’ve always known that I thrive on a mixture of classroom learning and hands-on engagement, and it was really something to go from one extreme to another, [and] for a year, at that,” she said. Self-care also became a major element of Taylor-Klaus’ gap year. “I learned so much about taking care of myself, and how to step back and take alone time,” she said. “I spent a lot of time sitting up in a mango tree, just reflecting and watching the natural beauty around me.” The immersive experiences, she maintains, helped open her up and observe the differences between various cultures. “When we got to Fiji, it was a first for a lot of people to not be in a First World country,” she said. “I could see my friends maturing around me, and though I didn’t realize it at the time, so was I. It was amazing to grow together, and so much of how I feel I grew is still inexplicable.” Skyping her family from Australia on Thanksgiving at 6 a.m., after weeks of no contact, provided Taylor-Klaus some positive feedback. “I remember that after the Skype [conversation], my family remarked on how happy, energetic, mature, and ‘me’ I sounded,” she said. “It’s not that I wasn’t ‘me’ before the trip, but I evolved, in a sense. It was truly incredible.” Having completed her first month at Wesleyan, Taylor-Klaus reflected on how her gap year has already influenced her University experience. “My gap year definitely made it easier to adjust, and I think that the confidence I gained by traveling made me much less scared,” she said. “I realized that if I could go to a Central American country by myself, without any knowledge of Spanish, and do well for myself, then I would be just fine in college.” The experience drastically broadened her horizons before coming to Wesleyan. “I really burst out of a bubble by leaving Atlanta,” Taylor-Klaus said. “Traveling the world, then coming to Wesleyan was bursting into an entirely new one, but the skills and self-knowledge I gained over the past year have stuck with me.” Comfortably reclined on a couch in the Clark basement lounge, Taylor-Klaus intoned that the past year has solidified her sense of self, while also strengthening her resolve. “I’m so much more at home in my own skin after the entire experience,” she said. “College was nothing to be scared of, and I’m now able to treat this as yet another adventure.”"
"Tensions Heighten in the Wake of Scott Backer Scandal","2016-10-07","by Jenny Davis, Aaron Stagoff-Belfort, Gili Lipman, Jake Lahut, Editor-in-Chief, News Editors, Features Editor","Protestors hung posters on poles, windows, and walls across campus. c/o William Halliday, Photo Editor Before the Boston Globe article, before the calls for President Roth’s and Dean Farias’ resignations, and before the social media pandaemonium, there were only rumors. The lawsuit against former Associate Dean of Students Scott Backer and Vermont Academy has been in the public record since 2011, and two alumni claim that past students had been aware of Backer’s sexual misconduct. “The WSA executive committee and student affairs committee members seemed to know about Scott Backer’s firing at around that time,” a former WSA executive close to the matter said. “It was usually brought up in jest, to make fun of him behind closed doors.” According to the former WSA executive, students made jokes involving Backer’s texts with a 15-year-old student at Vermont Academy. Nothing, however, was reported to the administration. “I never reported it or really mentioned it because one, at the time, I thought it was just a rumor,” the WSA executive said. “Two, I thought it could also be a pair of WSA members in particular making shit up because Scott Backer sucks, and three, I figured the administration knew and didn’t care, or had investigated it somehow and came to the conclusion that they had nothing to worry about. In retrospect, I probably should’ve followed up, but I assumed that the Vermont Academy stuff was just a rumor and not verifiable.” Another former member of the WSA, who also wished to remain anonymous, also had suspicions about Backer, but did not follow through with official reporting to the administration. “I definitely had concerns at the time, some of them I raised, some of them I didn’t,” the former member said. “Now it’s too late. It is what it is.” The fallout from Backer’s recently revealed sexual misconduct by the Boston Globe has sent the University community into a tailspin of anger, grief, and confusion. Along with examining an additional court case involving Backer, The Argus spoke with current students, administrators, and alumni to shed light on the full repercussions of his concealed past.   “Everything Is Inherently Sullied” Hidden from students he interacted with throughout his nearly decade-long tenure at the University, Backer’s past has drawn forth raw emotions and troubling realizations after the fact for students who dealt with him in reporting sexual misconduct. Former Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) Intern Maggie Cohen ’12 brought a sexual assault case to the University through Backer. Finding out about his past at Vermont Academy re-opened a traumatic wound from her time on campus. “The unearthing of Scott’s past twisted the knife,” Cohen wrote in an email to The Argus. “It made me feel that my already fragile safety was nonexistent if the administrator responsible for adjudicating cases of sexual violence—not to mention other ethical infractions—was himself guilty of preying upon young people.” Cohen remembers her interactions with Backer as being unpleasant. “My interactions with Scott were strained and uncomfortable,” she said. “I knew that he was telling me he had my best interests in mind but that he represented Wesleyan and he wanted to keep any controversies to a minimum. Scott treated my case like it was routine.” Cohen, however, noted that the issues surrounding sexual assault at the University go far beyond Backer. “The lack of transparency goes beyond him & beyond President Roth,” she wrote. “The entire process has always been rigged, and I never knew what my rights were as a student coming forward to report sexual assault. In the year that I reported [2010-2011], Alysha Warren had not yet been hired, Tanya Purdy had not yet been hired, and the SART intern had only been a formal position for one year. The [previous] SART Intern was the only person who wholeheartedly supported me.” For Chloe Murtagh ’15, the recent Backer revelations put a cloud over the cases she was familiar with involving her friends, who she helped in the reporting process when working through the former dean. “He was the one handing out these moral judgments and verdicts, and he clearly had no standards of ethics and respect,” Murtagh said. “Everything is inherently sullied.” A student examines a poster detailing the Roth administration’s failures. c/o William Halliday, Photo Editor Elias v. Wesleyan University One of the most thoroughly documented examples of how Backer operated in sexual assault hearings is the federal lawsuit Elias v. Wesleyan. The case, which involves Backer as the adjudicator of a contested sexual assault ruling at the University, was recently settled out of court on Sept. 29, 2016 and calls into question Backer’s credibility in adjudicating sexual assault cases. The plaintiff, Scott Elias ’14, who served as the chair of the WSA’s Public Safety Advisory Committee and was a brother of Beta Theta Pi, was found guilty on two of three counts of sexual misconduct at the end of his senior year: one for sexual harassment, the other for sexual assault. The central argument of the Elias suit contends that Backer’s ruling on Elias’ sexual misconduct and its subsequent punishment—which allowed him to graduate but prevented him from attending senior week and commencement—was unfair and overly burdensome, mainly because of the political climate and controversy surrounding sexual assault at the University in 2014. In a text correspondence with Jane Doe 1, Elias was intoxicated and sent a flurry of disturbing messages. He wrote, “Don’t be that girl” after Doe didn’t reply to a text about meeting up while he was leaving the Beta Fraternity. After Jane Doe wrote, “you know we’re not hooking up, right?” at 12:48 a.m., some of Elias’ 14 unanswered texts in response were “I rally like you a lt,” “I kinda wana do dirty things to slut,” and “I Anna sleep with you babe.” Given the nature of his own case, Backer ironically dismissed the severity of Elias’ text messages. “Later that day, Plaintiff met with Dean Scott Backer who assured him that because Jane Doe’s allegations appeared to involve a ‘stupid drunken message a long time ago,’ which was an isolated occurrence as opposed to repeated behavior, it would not be ‘a serious Title IX concern,’’’ a court document states, quoting Backer. “Plaintiff left the meeting under the impression that he would be able to participate in the WSA meeting on April 20.” Upon reading the amended complaint available online, Murtagh argued why Backer was in no position to preside over sexual misconduct cases. “It’s stuff like that, that quote really illustrates how, even if we don’t dig up the fact that Scott Backer ever said some ridiculously fucked up thing…it’s just like this reality that, that’s [Backer’s] threshold of something that’s fucked up,” Murtaugh said. “If he doesn’t think that that’s fucked up, it’s very clear that the stuff we were reporting to him is fucked up.” Elias’ attorney, Kimberly Lau of Warshaw Burnstein LLP, has been a vocal opponent of many aspects of sexual assault adjudications writ large, such as: the definition of consent; assumptions about those accused in false reports, which account for somewhere between two and eight percent of all accusations according to a commonly cited study by UMass and Northeastern professors; and the methods behind sexual assault statistics themselves. In an article entitled “Is there a rape culture on college campuses?,” Lau, who is the piece’s main contributor, argues that the statistics surrounding sexual assault on college campuses, such as the proverbial “one in four” or “one in five,” are fundamentally flawed in methodology. For Lau, this flaw is connected to what she calls an “over inclusive” definition of consent. “The way the term is defined in the Survey is over inclusive and appears to be more the product of political and social agendas than what most people would consider ‘sexual assault,’” Lau said. The article further contends that the definition of “incapacitated” is too vague, advocating to void all assaults based on a lack of consent due to intoxication in the revised statistics. When asked if former Dean Backer’s credibility as an adjudicator would have been undermined given recent revelations about his personal past of sexual misconduct, Lau declined to comment when contacted less than a week after the settlement of the case. Because of the recent settlement, Lau said that she was unable to comment on any aspect of the suit. In defending Elias, Lau and Warshaw Burnstein focus extensively on the damages caused to the plaintiff, such as his loss of employment on Capitol Hill by a “prominent” member of congress, the loss of tuition, his future employment and graduate school prospects, and his deteriorating mental health. Elias’ legal team claims that the investigation, and mainly Backer’s judgment in the proceedings, ruined his post-graduate ambitions. “Plaintiff has not applied to any post-graduate institutions of higher education due to stress, depression, and anxiety associated with coping with Wesleyan’s wrongful findings,” Elias’ lawyers said in the plaintiff’s response to the University’s request for production of documents. Following graduation, Elias was employed as a staff assistant in 2014 for Congresswoman Ann Kuster (D) of New Hampshire’s second district. Elias left the team after just a couple of months in the summer of 2014 and complained that losing his position served as sufficient punishment. In Exhibit L of the court documents, Elias obfuscates his reason for departing, citing “personal reasons” rather than his exposure as a perpetrator. “I also interned and briefly served as a Staff Assistant on the House side before leaving for personal reasons earlier this summer and beginning a government affairs internship with the Solar Energy Industry Association this fall,” he said. Elias ended up applying to many prestigious companies, including APCO Worldwide, an independent global public affairs and strategic communications consultancy, and Group Gordon, a public relations and strategic communications firm. The chief claim of the employment section is that Backer’s verdict prevented Elias from finding employment. Despite this, just one month after resigning from his job as a staffer, Elias joined Solar Energy Industries Association as a business development associate in September 2014. He was promoted to membership development manager in July 2015. “Scott Elias has been with the Solar Energy Industries Association since 2014, where he operates at the intersection between renewable energy policy and renewable energy business development. Scott currently focuses on identifying and connecting solar industry thought leaders through membership development and strategic alliance opportunities that build the size and influence of the U.S. solar industry,” Elias’ current bio on his LinkedIn account reads. President Roth argued in his Sunday blog post that Backer’s authority in sexual assault investigations was checked by a multi-person process that struck the “appropriate balances.” Although he worked with other deans, mainly Dean Rick Culliton, it became clear in the Elias suit that Backer played an instrumental role at every level of the sexual assault reporting process. Backer was responsible for recording the entirety of the testimony and proceedings in Elias’ three cases. In addition, a photo of Elias and Jane Doe 1 at a formal was deemed “irrelevant and off limits” by Backer and the University during the course of the investigation, according to Exhibit M of the court documents. Backer also issued a no-contact order and restrictions on University facilities to Elias. This is included in Backer’s letter to Elias informing him of the University’s decision. Backer’s signature is on almost every document concerning Elias’ case in the suit, and he worked with all three of Elias’ accusers throughout the reporting process. In Elias’ account of the night, he claimed that there were no signs that Jane Doe was unable to consent to his sexual advances. “I assumed that she had also drank at least some alcohol, but I had no reason to believe that [redac] was in a state of drunkenness or intoxication because she seemed to have complete control of her balance, and did not speak to me with slurred speech,” Elias said. “[redac]’s steady gait on the walk towards the Butterfields tunnels and her verbal confirmation that she wanted to enter the Butterfields, continued to lead me to believe that she was not incapacitated in any way.” However, the Administrative Panel’s written judgment on the hearings, signed at the bottom by Scott Backer, found Elias guilty of violating the University’s sexual misconduct policy from 2010-2011. Overall, the panel found the details Jane Doe provided to be more persuasive than Elias’ account. Critical to the panel’s assessment was their belief that Elias had presented self-incriminating evidence, indicating in his written account that there was no verbal consent to repeated sexual contact. While the two parties in the case differed on the details on what happened in the Butterfields tunnels, the panel determined that there was enough overlap in the accounts to validate central elements of Jane Doe’s testimony. Elias seemingly called into question the reliability of his own account when describing his alcohol consumption that night and how it clouded his judgment. “The respondent also admittedly misread or misinterpreted nonverbal from the complainant which should have indicated the lack of consent,” the decision said. “Further, the panel found that the respondent’s aggressive engagement with the complainant did not allow for the acquisition of consent before the sexual contact commenced.” After Backer’s ruling on behalf of the University, Elias was given nine judicial points out of a maximum of ten between the two counts, and subsequently graduated despite being barred from commencement and senior week.   Responses: Administrative and Activist On Monday, Oct. 3, two days after the Globe article ran and one day after Roth published a blog post addressing Backer’s firing, Amy Mattox ’17 and Avigayl Sharp ’17 penned choice words from Roth’s post in Sharpie markers on their chests and left their shirts at home. Mattox ’17, left, and Sharp ’17, right, protest the administration’s response to Backer’s firing. c/o Jacob Karlin “Avigayl and I had been hanging out all day, fuming and not sure where to put that,” Mattox said. “We were talking about the importance of rendering pain visible. Everything kept coming back to the material reality of pain in the body, and the fact that those emails, which seemed so casual and so unimportant, and so symbolic of bureaucracy—sending a lot of emails—landed with a lot of pain….Avigayl and I both felt the need to exteriorize the pain in some way and make people who were going about their daily lives, knowing the information but really electing to suppress it, aware of the fact that this was landing in some sort of material, real way.” Mattox was particularly struck by the words “nothing amiss,” which Roth wrote in his blog post to discuss the findings of the Pepper Hamilton investigation; she wrote those words on her body, while Sharp penned “an abundance of caution.” “It was, like, the most absurd statement to read in the aftermath of eight years of this shit,” she said. “And then the whole apparatus of the administration not dealing with violence against students, and their own violence against students.” Nudity was vital to Mattox and Sharp’s protest. “There’s a direct analog of…the fact that the body is where sexual violence occurs, and the nude body is generally where it occurs,” Mattox said. “My body in particular, and Avigayl’s body, have been subject to that sort of violence, and it’s normally concealed for fear of shame and fear of people not caring….It’s also just a freaky thing to see people’s naked bodies….It’s something you’re supposed to keep at home, something you’re supposed to keep under your clothes. That tension is never going to go away.” Later that same afternoon, Roth sent a brief, campus-wide apology email (subject line: “An apology”), noting that he’d neglected to include one in his blog post and preliminary staffing update. Later that afternoon, The Argus asked him what he would say to survivors who were still upset in the wake of the information about Backer’s firing. “I think that dealing with the aftermath of sexual violence is hard enough, and the worst part of this episode with Scott Backer is that we are adding to the anguish that some of those people feel,” Roth said. “That’s one of the things I most regret about the current situation.” Roth reflected on his dismay at the news that Backer had been fired from his previous position for sexual misconduct. “The first thing I asked when we heard this—I was actually away; it was in the summer—was, ‘How did we hire this guy?’ and ‘How did we never hear?’” he said. “Well, of course we don’t do background checks once someone is on the job. And so should we have known? Well, in retrospect, yes, we should have known. Do I have an avenue where I think someone was negligent and not pursuing a reasonable report about this? I don’t. I have confidence in the Dean of Students office, that they would never have concealed this. In fact, once we heard this, Backer was immediately confronted and fired.” Paige Hutton ’18, though, was hardly appeased by Roth’s apology or his explanation. Finding fault with Roth’s decision to not inform students immediately after Backer’s firing, Hutton pointed out the administration’s apparent lack of attention to students’ needs. “They clearly didn’t see this as a big deal, or a big enough deal, and that happened in two different phases,” she said. “Years ago, when students were raising concerns about him, and they [the administration] didn’t listen, and now when Roth is saying, basically, that in this not telling it was clear that they didn’t think it was important enough to tell us. That, to me, is probably the worst thing.” Immediately after firing Backer, the Roth administration hired the Philadelphia law firm Pepper Hamilton to investigate his handling of sexual assault cases while at the University. Although the firm was criticized in a BuzzFeed article for being notoriously soft on administrators, as well as failing to consider student complaints of administrators in their review process, the firm’s report at Baylor University resulted in multiple firings and resignations, most notably with the school’s football coach and president. “We believe that they are best in class,” Roth said of Pepper Hamilton. “Of course, BuzzFeed, and other publications, perhaps, will say that they don’t always satisfy the students who bring the complaints. Well, that’s going to be true with any law firm; they don’t always satisfy people who bring these issues to the fore, because sometimes they don’t find what those people want. Not that they’re immune from criticism. They’re not perfect. But I don’t know that any other firm has a better reputation.” Besides, Roth continued, the University had sought the firm to identify issues with Backer’s performance. “We were not looking for a clean slate,” Roth said. “We were looking for problems, because if there were problems there, we wanted to fix them.” Sarah Chen Small ’18, however, wasn’t so sure. “The administration continues to set student needs as a last priority and then tells us that we’re too stupid to understand why this continual state of neglect and abuse is actually not that bad not the administration’s fault,” she wrote in an email to The Argus. “For example, Michael Roth said he didn’t take complaints [about Scott Backer] seriously or utilize them in the Pepper Hamilton review process because people only complain when a case doesn’t go their way, essentially throwing a tantrum. Last year not a single rapist was found guilty on this campus. So by basic logic and deduction, something this administration clearly lacks, complaints about Backer are not neutral, evenly distributable, or disposable. The people ‘complaining’ are majority female, of color, queer, trans, and low income. You cannot explain away the repeated harm the administration has done to these students.” More than just criticize Roth’s choice not to reveal the reasons for Backer’s firing, students have railed against the administration’s failure to address what they see as a flawed sexual assault policy. Much of Tuesday’s open town hall meeting focused on these perceived failures. “It’s consistently clear that the administration will always fail students as it’s set up right now,” Yael Horowitz ’17 said, who co-organized the town hall called “WhoRunsWes: an open town hall about community events.” “And it’s also pretty obvious that students really need to talk about this, and need to heal. The administration isn’t going to create those spaces for us, so if these spaces are going to happen, they’re going to have to be created by students.” Horowitz reflected on what she sees as a legacy of administrative failure, noting that it extends far beyond sexual assault policy. “I’ve seen the administration fail, always, like when [Vice President of Equity and Inclusion/Title IX Officer Antonio] Farias signed onto the letter about [defending free speech in] The Argus, and Farias’ actions in general of not supporting students of color, and Roth’s actions about sexual assault and about divestment and about a lot of issues on campus,” Horowitz said. “I think there’s been a ton of attempts to mobilize in the past around this, and there’s always another one. This is building off of that legacy.” In her eyes, the Backer scandal reveals skewed administrative priorities. “Right now, it’s clear that the administration and the school are concerned about continuing to make money and covering their asses in terms of liability, and they don’t care at all about survivors or victims or people who are underrepresented or experience microaggressions or anything like that,” she said. “They care about ‘fairness,’ but fairness is a coded word that doesn’t actually acknowledge the systemic power dynamics that are at play in most of these situations.” At the end of the over two-hour long town hall meeting, the group engaged in a blind consensus to decide on action items discussed throughout the night. Abby Cunniff ’17 felt heartened by the group’s cohesion. “I was hearing a lot of people really interested in investing in collectivism, and investing in prioritizing the needs of the student body in response to the administration clearly failing to do that routinely for the past four years,” she said. “I think that those two things were incredibly empowering for me to hear from other people, and I think that this is one of the highest levels of collective analysis that I’ve ever seen in a group, especially in a group of two hundred people.” Perhaps the most significant moment was the consensus to pursue measures to remove Roth and Farias from their posts. Hutton commented on that decision. “I think no matter who’s in charge, it would be roughly the same, but even just the image of Roth and Farias gone will encourage students to expect more of the next people,” Hutton said. “It’s unprecedented that two hundred people here called for the removal of the top two administrators at this school,” Henry Prine ’18 agreed immediately following the consensus. “In looking at the many failures of the admin, we are recognizing the overall trend of a detrimental lack of transparency, accountability, and leadership when dealing with situations. The way they dealt with the firing and investigation of Backer was only the latest iteration of this.” Another main point of action on which town hall meeting attendees focused was the lack of an advanced practice registered nurse, or an APRN, who has the ability to prescribe medication, on the Counseling and Psychological Services staff. “The fact that there’s not a psychiatrist in CAPS is craziness,” Hutton said. “I really think that that should have been their main priority from the beginning.” Despite the necessity of an APRN, this year’s Sexual Assault Response Team intern Lex Spirtes ’17 reiterated that when it comes to sexual assault, ad-hoc counseling is not enough. “I feel like the administrators bring you to CAPS, as if it’s an emotional issue rather than a policy one,” Spirtes said.“It may be an emotional issue as well, but I’ve been seeking emotional help, and you can’t just put me on CAPS to resolve this issue that has arisen because of policy issues that have nothing to do with my emotional stability.” In a Monday interview, Roth defended his administration’s sexual assault policies. “I do think that we have to ensure a fair procedure so that a person accused of sexual assault also feels that the procedures are fair, because it is possible that someone is accused who is not responsible,” he said. “So on the one hand, fairness and due process are important. On the other hand, supporting survivors and making sure that their complaints are held, or heard in a speedy and fair way is also important.” Roth also reiterated his commitment to protecting those who are vulnerable to abuse of power, as well as his deep regret about Backer’s tenure at the University. “I think that the abuse of power by men and by people in administrative and professorial positions is disgusting,” he said. “It’s unjust, and it is counter-educational. So finding ways to make sure that people who are vulnerable to those with power can defend themselves has been one of the most important things that I’ve tried to do. For this to happen on my watch is a terrible thing for the University, because I do think that fighting for more equality for women, and for LGBTQ students, and for minority students, is what I try to do every day.” Spirtes still has myriad issues with the administration’s handling of sexual assault cases, including her own. “I’m feeling frustrated,” she said. “I’m currently going through something with the administration right now. It’s about a sexual assault, and I’ve had to go to various parts of the administration, and I’ve been told, ‘Nothing can be done!’ I’m like, ‘Can nothing be done? Or are you just shrugging off my case?’” Spirtes further spoke to the ways that the wake of the Backer case opens up conversations about transparency. “They’re saying that conversations are happening that then I’m not included in, and I think people keep hiding behind policy instead of engaging with students and having these conversations,” she said. “At this point, in my situation at least, I feel like I’m at a loss with the administration and academic accommodations. I never interacted with Scott Backer myself, but it’s definitely stirring up these things. It’s terrible, and what happened with Scott Backer is terrible, but it’s part of a larger system in which Scott Backer, to some extent, is being able to be used as a scapegoat for other members of the administration, who are in smaller ways not helping survivors and defending perpetrators.” As for Scott Backer, his whereabouts are currently unknown."
"Board of Education Considers Closing Macdonough Elementary School","2016-10-27","by Gili Lipman, News Editor","c/o Middletown Press The Middletown Board of Education is expected to decide whether or not to close one of the district’s eight elementary schools at their meeting next month. This move would be made in order to free up space for the budget and would save $750,000, according to Middletown Superintendent Patricia Charles. Over the past few months, the Ad Hoc School Closure Committee, a sub-committee of the Board of Education, performed a study and discussed many options for the elementary schools. A recommendation was given to the Board of Education that none of the schools should be shut down, but certain members voiced that if one school absolutely had to be closed, it should be Macdonough Elementary School in the North End of town. The decision is imminent, as Charles is expected to propose the budget for the following academic year sometime in December. “There are certain people who are very passionate about the Macdonough School not closing,” Charles said. “The Macdonough School is vital to the North End part of the community, but people who attend the Spencer School would argue that it is vital for their part of the neighborhood. Everyone loves their school, and it is a very hard and emotional decision looming.” Anna Lu ’17 explained that the North End of town, where Macdonough is situated, houses some of the most economically disadvantaged residents of Middletown. “Macdonough is central to the location specifically for the reason that parents and residents can walk their children to school,” Lu said. “There are over 240 students that attend this school that would get dispersed to other locations around Middletown. There is a petition on Change.org titled ‘Save Macdonough Elementary School!’” The petition, which currently has just over 750 signatures, was created to raise awareness on the importance of keeping the Macdonough School in operation. “Macdonough has unique needs, so it is a very difficult decision because it is the hub of that community,” Charles said. Many University students have dedicated time to the students at Macdonough and formed relationships with them through tutoring and other community engagement programs. “Macdonough is in the North End of Middletown, which, unfortunately, is an area many Wesleyan students avoid,” Jess Wolinsky ’17 said, a participant in one such program. “This I think is because of a lack of understanding of Middletown in general. Because of this, Macdonough feels like a liaison between Wesleyan students and the North End. The privilege of going to Wes can often deter students from doing anything in Middletown except eating at their restaurants, and having a relationship with Macdonough absolutely changes that.” The tutoring program between the school and the University has helped to provide these children with a foundation for their education. “Macdonough has been a central partner with multiple Wesleyan educational programs,” Lu said. “This elementary school has not only provided these children with an education, but I have had the personal opportunity to work with these students. ASCEND, this bi-weekly tutoring program, offers homework help and interactive activities such as scientific experiments that question the difference of dry and normal ice. Children are the future, and with the destruction of one of these great programs, it will only create a greater economic disparity between the Middletown and Wesleyan communities.” The Bread Salvage program is another way that Macdonough works in conjunction with the University. “My program, Bread Salvage, brings bread from Freihofer’s Warehouse in Cromwell, Conn. to three schools in Middletown, but Macdonough is the only school that allows us as volunteers to pass out the bread directly to families,” Wolinsky said. “I have met several families this way, and though they do not necessarily rely on the bread for their families’ meals, Bread Salvage is a very important way to recycle bread that otherwise will be thrown out. Having an extra loaf a week is important to many of the people I have created relationships with at Macdonough.” James Wilson ’17 has seen firsthand the effect that the University partnering with McDonough has had on many children who are students there. “Each kid comes from a unique background and has a different outlook on the world around them, but at that school every kid can be at the same level regardless of social status,” Wilson said. “The kids love to learn and really love their teachers, although some might not want to first admit it.” Wilson spoke to the implications of closing down the school. “I might not get to see all of the same kids with some going to different schools, but that is much worse for the children as many would lose friends to close schools,” Wilson said. “Furthermore, the parents of many of the kids would no longer be able to walk their kids to and from school, and would therefore be required to spend more time away from work in order to transport the kids a further distance, as well as create the need for a car or bus.” Wolinsky commented on the symbiotic relationship between the University and Macdonough. “The parents with children at Macdonough are very open to allowing their children to interact with Wesleyan students,” Wolinsky said. “Because of their openness, Wesleyan students who are excited about elementary school education have been able to tutor Macdonough’s students in math and reading, as well as establish after-school activities for enrichment like Middletown Urban Garden Club.” Wolinsky mentioned the unique qualities that characterize the University’s relationship with Macdonough. “No other Middletown school really opens its doors for Wesleyan to do extracurricular activities with their students, which is what makes Wesleyan’s relationship with them so special,” she said. “I feel like Macdonough is more of a community than any other school I have seen in Middletown, and if it closes down, both Wesleyan students and Macdonough families alike will be devastated.”"
"Why We Won’t Talk About War","2016-11-03","by Jake Lahut, Features Editor","With less than a week to go until Election Day—and given the collective nausea surrounding the 2016 presidential campaign—it might be better to wait to stave off debate about how we ignore our perpetual wars. If anything, this article is intended more for the archives than it is for the proverbial “undecided voter” whose mind might miraculously change because of a vapid opinion piece in a college newspaper. Nonetheless, the fact that we continuously compartmentalize and ignore our military conflicts abroad is shameful. The arena of our second-longest war, Afghanistan, was only mentioned once in this year’s presidential debates. The Vietnam War, our longest war, was seared into the minds of baby boomers, 9.7 percent of whom were involved in the conflict. Two thirds of those who served in Vietnam enlisted voluntarily, dispelling the relatively popular myth that most Vietnam veterans were coerced into combat by the draft. Without the draft and a comparable feeling of civic duty, millennials and Gen Xers have served in the Gulf War and the War on Terror in far fewer numbers. Less than one half of one percent of Americans have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. The 2.5 million who have served in the War on Terror have seen more combat than previous veterans because the military now outsources non-combat-related services to contractors. Depending on the year, close to 30 percent of defense spending has gone to independent contractors who do anything and everything from serving food to gathering intelligence, and even to fighting in combat. There has been a litany of articles in media publications and academic journals about the outsize influence of Private Military Contractors (PMCs) on the United States Department of Defense, most notably with Halliburton and its connections to former Vice President Dick Cheney. Less removed from the machine of the military industrial complex is the widespread problem of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) among veterans, with the greatest concerns arising from an alarmingly high suicide rate. Over 20 veterans commit suicide each day. Veterans face a 21 percent higher risk of suicide than the rest of the American population. Though there have been mini documentary segments about this on just about every major nightly news program and on myriad alternative news outlets, the American public by and large ignores the suffering of veterans, at best compartmentalizing it, and, at worst, outright not caring about it. How this has happened is a complicated question. Academics like Byron Nichols, Professor Emeritus of Political Science at Union College, have suggested that one turning point in the American public’s attitude toward wars and engagement with service members came when military parades ceased after the Vietnam War. Longer term trends include a lack of news coverage from arenas of war by foreign correspondents. With the exception of a few organizations, Vice, for example, most major news organizations have cut back on foreign correspondents. Yet, at some point, we have to stop blaming institutions and accept that we are the institutions that perpetuate what we don’t like in the world. Blackwater didn’t get its money out of nowhere; we elected the members of Congress and president that made those appropriations. The inadequacy of coverage for vets with PTSD didn’t happen on its own; we made the conscious choice to care more about other issues when electing our representatives who sat on the Veterans Affairs Committee. We’re the ones who condemn the moral atrocities of war by not even showing up at the ballot box when it counted. We are the generation that would rather spout off on social media than write a letter or make a phone call to our elected officials telling them why we’ll vote them out if they don’t stand up against a lack of funding for the VA. We are a generation that spends billions of dollars on contractors who swear allegiance not to the flag, but to the almighty dollar. Even closer to home, we can support our Posse Veterans, of whom now there are around 30 on campus. While they don’t expect us to frantically go around thanking them for their service everywhere they go, we can do simple things like listening to their different experiences and refrain from morally judging their past. How we treat veterans on campus is a direct extension of how we treat veterans in our society writ large, and on a campus this small, we can make much more of a difference than on most other fronts. Given that we are four days away from a potential Trump presidency—which is closer than ever to happening, based on the latest forecast from FiveThirtyEight—many of the problems we face now that already seem awful could quickly become absurdly abhorrent. Given this country’s compartmentalization of our global military presence, the conditions for the rise of a fascist tyrant are all the ripe. One public figure who has made a consistent effort to engage with the grave realities of our military is NBC’s Willie Geist, who frequently brings up casualties and PTSD on “Morning Joe” and tweets out the daily number of casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rukmini Callimachi of The New York Times is perhaps the best terrorism reporter in the world, finding her way into the chatrooms of the Islamic State and following major players that most people outside of the intelligence community otherwise wouldn’t know about. So after Election Day, and hopefully after Donald Trump picks up his toys and goes home, let’s start talking about the most impactful and largest scale thing this country does: waging war. If we keep compartmentalizing and ignoring it, we cannot claim the moral high ground once we start paying attention. Lahut is a member of the class of 2017."
"Why We Must Talk to Trump Supporters","2016-11-10","by Jake Lahut, Features Editor","After reading the scores of heartfelt Facebook statuses, calling my parents, venting to my housemates, and seeing my Facebook friends who have supported President-Elect Donald J. Trump—or suddenly revealed that they voted for him despite concealing their support publicly—I am compelled to plead for something that will be deeply unpopular on Wesleyan’s campus: Please talk to Trump supporters, especially before the President-Elect is inaugurated. This is far easier and more accessible for some among us, mainly the proverbial cis-gendered heterosexual white male. Because of safety concerns alone given the violence provoked and perpetuated at many Trump rallies, talking to Trump supporters is far more difficult for people whose identities have been openly attacked by their candidate, notably—but by no means limited to—the Latino, Middle Eastern and South Asian diasporas, as well as black and Jewish Americans who have seen a precipitous rise in overt racism and anti-Semitism brought out by many Trump supporters, especially members of the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis. Nonetheless, those among us who are able, but potentially not yet willing, must step up and speak to some of the 50 million or so Americans who voted for a historically defined fascist, or at least someone who pretended to be to initially promote his brand and later win the presidency. I worked on a book about Donald Trump for Mark Singer of The New Yorker. In the final product, “Trump and Me,” Singer holds two lenses to the rise of the real estate mogul turned fascist demagogue: his experience writing a profile of The Donald in 1996 that took several months, and the research we could come up with together on just about everything the man had said in public life relating to political positions, insofar as he has positions. Though I have nowhere near the amount of expertise on Trump as someone like my boss or Trump’s ghostwriter would have, I gained a healthy dose of perspective on Trump’s ability to alter what he says based on the audience in front of him. For many people reading this, that audience has never been us. One of the shocking things I’ve come to realize in the last few days—and, as Trump would say, ‘believe me, folks,’ there have been plenty—is the fact that, much like the so-called Beltway Elite that got the election wrong, many of my friends and colleagues at Wesleyan do not know any Trump supporters personally. I do. Some are former teammates, others closer friends, and some are family members. This proximity to dissent is becoming increasingly lost on our generation as we perpetually self-select and enclose ourselves in social media and our institutions of choice. Perhaps the most influential Trump supporter I’ve known is my late Uncle Woods, my mother’s youngest brother who died suddenly over the summer. We constantly argued about politics, sometimes with pleasure, others with anger and disdain. Whatever our feelings were, however uncomfortable we felt, we never shut each other out (unless my mom told us to take a break for the sake of the rest of the extended family at dinner). The important thing about debating with my proverbial conservative uncle wasn’t that it humanized a Trump supporter, it’s that we were better off engaging and disagreeing than talking past each other and letting animosity fester. Many Trump supporters were once on our side. There are over 200 counties in this country that elected Barack Obama twice, yet voted for Trump on Tuesday. This is hard to square with the fact that much of the momentum behind Trump’s rise stems from the backlash to the election of the nation’s first black president. Despite all of the progress made during the Obama administration, over 900 democratic state legislators were defeated over the course of his two terms. I don’t know how to explain all of this coherently and convincingly. I’ll leave that to the tireless journalists and academics who sacrifice sleep and their cherished relationships just to figure these things out. All I have is a hope that engagement with our political opponents can fight off the toxicity and danger of an intramural scrimmage turning into a war between alternate realities. Though I may not have known how important these debates were until my uncle was gone, I believe more than ever that just about everyone would benefit from having someone in their inner circle to vigorously disagree with. I’m fully aware that it’s far easier for someone like me to make this argument than it is for the people I’ve mentioned above, but there has to be a limit to our safe spaces and social justice jargon when people’s lives are at stake. Places like Wesleyan can become breeding grounds for fascism despite our best intentions. We have bred Trump supporters here, one of whom wrote at length about his conversion in today’s New York Times. No matter how invigorating it may be to live on the frontier of the political left, our rhetoric and sheer lack of empathy—mostly those of us who are not under attack by Trump’s rhetoric—for those who don’t share our verbose jargon make us no different than those on the alt-right and in the Tea Party who spurred Trump’s rise in the first place, minus a dictionary worth of terms 98 percent of the population doesn’t understand. Talking to Trump supporters and checking our jargon at the door doesn’t mean that we have to absolve them for political views that invalidate human lives, nor does it make us complicit in the dialectic of the neoliberal patriarchy and the post-truth rise of fascism, or whatever else we’ll call it from our classrooms high above in the ivory tower. What talking to Trump supporters does do, however, is make them realize that the PC liberal elite they hate, the abject Other they hate, and whoever else they want to take their country back from, are complex human beings just like them. Engaging with those we vehemently disagree with also reveals something about our character. It shows that not only can we reciprocate the humanization we lend them, but that we can take Michelle Obama’s high road and resist matching their hatred and ignorance with our own. Most importantly, this is what a civic society is all about, and we cannot preserve or improve it on our own. When I think back to how I felt by my uncle’s side, I don’t fear the loss of the republic or the horrors of fascism. Instead, a ball begins to grow in my throat as I long for one more shot to be in that position to change his mind, and to question my own assumptions. While I can’t confidently argue that a justifiable amount of good will come out of this national catastrophe, I have to believe that there’s still something we can do to make a difference. It all starts with a face-to-face conversation, a raise of the eyebrows, a huff of frustration, and a handshake—or even a hug—at the end, followed by an “until next time,” where you’ll vigorously disagree and be better off for it all over again.

"Students at University Participate in Nationwide Jewish Resistance Movement","2016-12-01","by Camille De Beus, Assistant News Editor","c/o Jonas Powell, Photo Editor Jewish students and others at the University came together on Wednesday, Nov. 30, demonstrating on Andrus Field in a Day of Jewish Resistance. The event was part of a nationwide effort to draw the line against the appointment of Steve Bannon and the normalization of hate and violence, among other calls to action. The University was one of over 30 communities in the country that participated in the Jewish social justice organization IfNotNow’s national day of action. “For too long, our Jewish institutions have spent the majority of their political capital on ensuring that the American government supports Israel unilaterally,” a statement from IfNotNow read. “Now, that stance threatens to make them complicit with newly-emboldened white nationalists that swept Trump to power on the back of anti-Semitic tropes. Bannon, Trump and their ilk are relying on our silence as they quietly normalize the sort of hate that characterized the Trump Campaign.” Students who participated gathered at 12:15 p.m. in Boger Hall for a reflection and dialogue before taking action. At 12:45 p.m., they marched out to Andrus Field forming a line, singing two songs, and reading a statement adapted from IfNotNow’s script. “The talk was basically for framing the action and what was going to go down,” one of the students who helped coordinate the event, Anna Cohen ’17, said. “The reason why we thought that was important was because anything that goes around with Israel or Jewish identity politics in general can get really complicated. We didn’t want people to be participating in an action where they didn’t know what they were standing for.” Talia Kaplan ’18 spearheaded the University’s participation in this movement. “I remember being really energized when reading about the actions that IfNotNow held last week, calling for Bannon to be fired,” Kaplan wrote in an email to The Argus. “When I saw they were holding a National Day of Action to escalate the call and looking for lots of communities to step up, I immediately thought of Wesleyan. We’re fortunate to have a very social justice-oriented campus, and a good number of student activists also identify as Jewish.” Participating in this event was about more than the Jewish community drawing a line. In particular, the reflection served as a place for students to be critical about how the Jewish community could improve internally and externally. “Within our community we talked a little bit about how we haven’t been as queer friendly as we could have been, especially with Hillel and the whole Mosaic United movement that went around them,” Cohen said. “….Then outside of our community we talked about how there’s been a way in which Jews have benefited from a model minority stereotype. We haven’t spoken out enough for other groups, because we’re maintaining our position of privilege within the United States.” The movement faced some criticism. According to Ella Israeli ’17, who helped lead the event, many people wondered why it had taken the Jewish community this long to draw the line. “Why is it that a white supremacist has to be elected and put in place, or in Steve Bannon’s case a senior advisor?” Israeli said. “Why do we have to wait? Why are we drawing the line here? We should have been drawing the line a dozen years ago.” Israeli acknowledged that there are Jewish organizations that have been working toward drawing this line for a while, by helping with movements such as Black Lives Matter. “I think it’s important for the Wesleyan Jewish community to do this now, because now more than ever they can’t just be the same people who have been working,” Israeli said. “What is happening now is not normal, and we need as many people fighting against it as we can possibly get….Wesleyan is a campus that for better or worse, the nation looks to in certain instances….I do think it’s not just we need as many people as we can get; we can’t just turn away right now.” Yael Fisher ’18, who helped organize the event, echoed this sentiment. She also discussed the importance of bringing to light the importance of helping students see Judaism as part of their identity and a source for their activism. “A lot of us feel alienated by the fact that most Jewish engagement on this campus is tied to religiosity,” Fisher said. “It doesn’t have to be that way. Judaism is both a culture and a religion, and it has a longstanding tradition of social justice and of activism and being at the forefront of activist causes, including our own liberation.” However, the event brought in some new faces to the Jewish activist scene. Jacob Karlin ’17 helped plan the event, but had previously not been involved with the Jewish community at the University. “It was really nice to be in a room full of people who I’d never seen also talk about their Judaism,” Karlin said. “It was really cool just to see a bunch of people just dissecting the moment that we were currently in. It was just really exciting to see an energy surrounding this conversation, and I’m really excited to see where this goes.” Many of the students involved with Wednesday’s event are hoping that this is just the beginning of the Jewish Resistance movement at the University. “I both hope and anticipate that Jewish (and other) students at Wesleyan will continue to act on their values,” Kaplan wrote. “Judaism has a long tradition of social justice. For example, after marching with MLK, Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel talked about how his feet were praying. My Jewish tradition compels me to pursue justice for all people, regardless of race, religion, or socioeconomic status.”"
"New Bookstore to Open on Main St. this Spring, Broad St. Books Employees Blindsided","2016-12-01","by Jake Lahut, Features Editor","c/o Northeast Collaborative Architects In preparation for the most financially significant unification of the University and the City of Middletown, President Michael Roth ’78, along with over a dozen Middletown dignitaries, announced the opening of a new campus bookstore, which will be run by R.J. Julia of Madison, Conn., on Main St. in a ribbon cutting ceremony on Wednesday, Nov. 30. The next day, rank and file employees of the current campus bookstore, Broad Street Books, were in disarray after being blindsided by the announcement. While employees were aware of a change in locations for the bookstore, most did not know that their parent company, Follett, had lost the bid for the Main St. location until they found out about it through the evening news, Shawn Beals’ story for The Hartford Courant, or the University Communications newsletter. “We don’t know if we’re keeping our jobs,” said a Broad Street Books employee who wished to speak under the condition of anonymity so that they could speak candidly. Several employees also cited a corporate policy that prevented them from speaking with the press. The University has made efforts in the past to let employees of companies whose contracts have ended continue working on campus with the next vendor, such as back in 2007 when many current Bon Appétit employees stayed over from Aramark, the previous campus dining vendor. However, these workers were all part of a union, Local 217, which was most recently covered in an Argus feature on Bon Appétit’s impending contract negotiations. At the ribbon cutting ceremony, R.J. Julia CEO and founder Roxanne Coady said that she is interested in employing Wesleyan students at the bookstore, and that the bookstore would look to hire 15 to 18 people upon opening in the spring of 2017. “Tell them to send us their applications!” Cody said at the ribbon cutting ceremony, referring to potential student employees. While several Broad Street Books employees expressed discontent and shock over the news that their parent company, Follett, had lost the bid to run the new bookstore, none of them were willing to speak on the record about the decision, citing a corporate policy. Several senior management level employees were absent the day after the ribbon cutting ceremony. Regional manager Bert Ramgren, who runs Broad Street Books for the Follett Corporation, did not comment after repeated requests from The Argus before the publication of this article. Follett Corporation communications officials also did not comment after repeated calls to the company’s headquarters in Westchester, IL. Spokesman Thomas Kline, who was unfamiliar with the Broad Street Books situation from his position in corporate headquarters, only suggested consultation with University administration. Director of University Communications Bill Holder told The Argus that Follett had been notified about the decision to go with R.J. Julia, though he did not know who specifically was contacted at Follett. R.J. Julia’s winning of the University’s bid for a new bookstore vendor is just one in a series of achievements for the Madison-based company, which has another location in the Hamptons on Long Island in addition to its original store and its soon-to-be third location in Middletown. “R.J. Julia hosts more than 300 events each year in Madison and has won several major awards,” a University press release given at the ribbon cutting ceremony read. “Among those are Publishers Weekly Bookseller of the Year, Lucile Pannell award for bookselling excellence, and Connecticut Magazine Best Bookstore.” Coady was impressed with the coordination required to pull off the project. “It is both rare and exciting to see a community come together the way Wesleyan, the City of Middletown, and the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce have,” Coady said. “Together we can create the kind of bookstore that will be the new standard for a college bookstore that is an integral, active member of its town.” Set to be completed before the end of the 2017 spring semester and ready for the 2017-18 academic year, the bookstore will boast an innovative yet historically preserved aesthetic in the 1930s art deco building that used to belong to Itkins Decorators. Northeast Collaborative Architects, the firm contracted by the school to design the new bookstore, created a two-level plan for the building that doubles its square footage from 6,000 square feet to 12,000 square feet. c/o Northeast Collaborative Architects Jeffrey Bianco, one of the firm’s partners, said he was particularly inspired by Finnish architect Alvar Aalto, whose aesthetic was particularly concerned with the Gesamtkunstwerk, or Total Work of Art, whereby the design, not just the building, but the interior surfaces and furniture are all coordinated toward the same goal. “Alvar Aalto did a beautiful bookstore in Helsinki that I looked to,” Bianco said. “I’m an historical architect. The rule is, it’s who you steal from that counts. Everything’s already been done, and this is a high quality to steal from.” Featuring an open basement level and a ground floor with bookshelves winding around the parameter on the first floor, the architectural plan is held together by sleek glass panels and preserved metal columns. This look is similar to the newly renovated Boger Hall, which houses the Gordon Career Center, the Art History Department, and the College of Letters. The bookstore basement space will have room for over 100 spectators during book talks, plus onlookers from the next floor up. Coady plans to put on around four events per week at the bookstore, which should make it the go-to venue for visiting authors rather than traditional venues like Russell House and the Daniel Family Commons. At a time when most universities are scaling back their bookstores and retracting them toward campus, Wesleyan is moving ahead to establish an even larger bookstore on the busiest section of Main St. between Washington and Court streets. The added unity between the campus and the city has all parties involved hoping for the best, especially under a Roth administration that has made a greater effort to engage with Middletown than previous administrations. “President Roth’s engagement with the Middletown community has been outstanding,” said Larry McHugh, president of the Middlesex Chamber of Commerce. “Wesleyan makes Middletown a better community just because of their presence here, and their diversity and everything else that they add to us. As you can tell, I’m excited.” “We’re committed to strengthening the ties between campus and Main Street,” Roth said. “Relocating Wesleyan’s bookstore is a major step in the direction, and I am so delighted that R.J. Julia Booksellers, with their phenomenal reputation, will be our partner in this effort.” The hype behind the project has been building rapidly once the markups were released, especially among Middletown dignitaries who have been wanting more retail on Main St. for years. “The new Wesleyan bookstore will be a transformative development for downtown Middletown and for the city as a whole,” said Middletown Mayor Dan Drew. “We’re going to have the best college bookstore in the country,” McHugh said, pumping his fist adorned with a gold and garnet ring in his support for the venture."
"The Future of The Argus","2016-12-06","by Jake Lahut, Features Editor","Out of almost any year in American history—and certainly during my short lifetime—the role and efficacy of the free press are now more uncertain than ever. Part of this is certainly because of the election of Donald Trump to the Presidency, but much of the public’s distrust in print publications and other institutions in the media would have remained regardless. I’ve done a decent amount of media reporting in the last three years, but I haven’t dedicated a piece to the role of the media at Wesleyan, particularly that of The Argus. As editor-in-chief for next semester, along with Gili Lipman ’17—though I speak here only for myself—and an equally concerned member of the community, I believe that The Argus has the potential to become an essential part of the Wesleyan experience as a top-notch college newspaper through our own discipline and with the help of the community. From our staff writers to the layout staff, The Argus is a team effort. The more members of the community join The Argus, bringing their diverse experiences with them, the better the paper will be for everyone in the community. Outgoing Editors in Chief Erica DeMichiel ’17 and Jenny Davis ’17 have done a remarkable job improving the paper this semester by listening to members of the community and carefully deliberating over what effective change looks like. While there is a long way to go, tangible evidence of this can be seen in the growth of our Voices section under its editor, Devonaire Ortiz ’18. An important qualifier, of course, is that as long as this publication is created through the labor of unpaid full-time students, there will always be mistakes, some of which can be avoided. The very nature of a student-run organization itself inherently involves learning from mistakes. If we had more time and less of an opportunity cost in writing and editing the paper, the quality would certainly improve, and, I hope, the paper would be more responsible for everyone in the Wesleyan community. Much of this opportunity cost would be assuaged by an hourly wage for members of the editorial staff, and even some staff writers, all of whom work upwards of 10 to 20 hours a week for no pay. Our only paid staff members are in copy, layout, and distribution. No editors are paid, not even the editors in chief. Paying college newspaper staff is not unprecedented, and editorial teams at many other schools, including UConn just up I-91 from us, are paid for their time. Comparatively, getting the editorial staff at The Argus to receive even a minimum wage has proven to be an uphill and sometimes controversial battle. However, that is not the point of this article, nor would it magically fix the institution’s problems of inclusivity and diversity, but it’s an often unknown and under-discussed aspect of the paper that deserves to be a qualifier at the very least. The Argus’ publication of the infamous op-ed questioning the legitimacy of the Black Lives Matter movement brought to light broader problems of inclusivity in the media, including The Argus as a historically white institution. Along those lines, the problem of whose voices were being heard and published by The Argus came to the forefront as well. I’ve listened to these concerns and taken them to heart, as have many of the current editors, and I can attest to the fact that the atmosphere of the institution has changed. New writers and editors of color have joined the staff, and there have been far more conversations at The Argus this semester concerning inclusivity, sensitivity, and diversity of coverage than ever before during my tenure as a staff writer and editor. The key element that has changed in the way the staff discusses our relationship to the broader Wesleyan community—besides the sheer amount of time we dedicate to these topics—is the focus on the socially conscious and editorially sound decision to make, rather than simply avoid, controversy. All too often after last fall, especially in the opinion section during my time as an assistant and later full opinion editor, the primary concern came in the potential backlash a piece would cause rather than the content or argument itself. With a shift in editors and more senior members of the staff who have become used to a more tense media climate on campus, this worry has subsided in large part and has been replaced by a willingness to simply do the right thing. While we’ve made some progress, there are still several concrete steps we can take to make The Argus a better and more responsible paper. The first is to become more proactive, and less reactive, in our coverage and creation of policies. Many of the immediate steps taken last fall in response to the activism around the BLM article were not embraced by much of the community precisely because they were reactive and appeared to have not crossed our minds previously. This has begun to change in The Argus’ updated editorial philosophy concerning the opinion section, letters to the editor, and a recent editorial on covering a Trump presidency more broadly. Similar proactive steps have begun in the creation of a sexual assault policy for the paper, as complicated and sensitive as that is. For a media publication writ-large, there are other steps that I would like to implement or at least see implemented long-term. I think that the twice-weekly model is a perfect fit for a school of Wesleyan’s size and cultural richness, and while we take pride in being the oldest twice-weekly student paper in the country, there are time-sensitive events that can be feasibly published on the web before the two production nights of the week. So far, publishing on the web first has been reserved for the biggest breaking news stories on campus, often in the form of briefs. This has partially changed this year, particularly with the Scott Backer coverage and the Trump protests, which were more in depth than many breaking briefs before. However, I see no reason why certain events-oriented articles and university coverage have to always wait for the next print issue. Sometimes a Second Stage review is far more relevant when released mid-week rather than on a Friday, or a profile of an author coming to campus should go online before the lecture rather than half a week after it happened. This would also make editing and production easier for the editors who are already overworked in many respects and could use the half-hour break an earlier published article would afford. Simply having a section editor on call at different points in the week—particularly in the news section—along with a copy editor and later an editor-in-chief would make the process streamlined and simple for breaking news articles, which can often be daunting when people are asleep or in class (hopefully not both). Another step The Argus took this semester was an increase in visual media coverage, particularly with the introduction of Facebook Live. Overall, the paper could use more photos, and could make multimedia far more relevant to its coverage. With a rich arts scene and top-notch film department, there’s every reason to believe that The Argus could step to the fore of visual reporting with the coordination of its students. Finally, and most importantly, communication between The Argus staff and the campus community will be crucial for a better symbiotic relationship. While the line between staff and community isn’t that thick, especially with the accessibility of weekly meetings at 5 p.m. in Usdan 108 and The Argus social media pages, it still feels as if we talk by each other rather than with each other. Much of this is due to the prominence of social media over in-person conversations. However, I’ve been touched this semester by the amount of positive interactions I’ve had with members of the community in person about the paper, from simple requests to difficult disagreements. I feel like a true community reporter here, and there may not be another point in my career where I will see such a tangible impact of my work in a community as intimate as this one. I also feel a great responsibility in this role, which I’ve attained somewhat unintentionally through a passion for writing (this is my 61st article of the semester and 115th in my career at The Argus). For better or worse, I’ve become the face of The Argus for many, and I take that quite seriously. However, the institution is far greater than I, and it will live on long after I graduate. I’ll always have my own opinions, but my first and foremost obligation next semester will be to the Wesleyan community, followed by the long-term vitality of the paper. With your help and engagement—from emails and aside comments to joining the paper and making your impact in print—we can make a better community through a better student newspaper.

"University Plans External Title IX Review","2017-02-02","by Jenny Davis, Molly Schiff, Executive Editor and News Editor","The University has announced its plan to examine its Title IX policy as well as its adherence to the Violence Against Women Act in a two-day long series of meetings with members of the University and external reviewers from the Victim Rights Law Center (VRLC). In an all-campus email, Vice President for Equity and Inclusion Antonio Farias outlined the upcoming review by the Victim Rights Law Center (VRLC) in conjunction with the campus-based Title IX Student Advisory Committee, Title IX Policy Committee, and members of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA). The review will take place on Tuesday, Feb. 7 and Wednesday, Feb. 8. “Title IX is a multi-pronged process of continuous improvement, meaning there is end to the struggle for gender equity,” Farias wrote in an email to The Argus. “The Title IX external review Wesleyan conducted 4 years ago provided the Title IX committees with a functional road map of changes that needed to be done.” The VRLC is a nonprofit law organization with offices in Boston, Mass. and Portland, Ore., that serves survivors of sexual assault nationwide. Deputy Director Lindy Aldrich, Education Program Senior Attorney Amanda Walsh, and affiliated attorney Candi Smiley, who is also Title IX director at Howard University, will be coming to the University as members of the external review team. “Founded as the first law center in the nation dedicated solely to serving the legal needs of sexual assault victims, the VRLC is the leader in representing sexual assault victims within the civil context,” the group’s website reads. The organization was chosen in a collaborative process that began by communicating with Title IX coordinators at other universities to acquire names of reputable consultants. After narrowing the field to four contenders, the Student Advisory Committee and the Policy Committee debated and made the final recommendation for selection. Additional information on each reviewer as well as a schedule of events are available on the Office of Equity and Inclusion’s website. “We agreed on VRLC for a few reasons: their credibility with many campuses, their lens toward creating fair process as well as supporting survivors and their ability to provide a diverse team,” Farias wrote.  Equity Compliance Director and Deputy Title IX Coordinator Debbie Colucci outlined a few goals of the review, citing specifically the need to perpetually seek improvement in the University’s policies. “We have two primary goals.  First, we know what our policies and procedures are and we know how they have evolved over the past few years through the work of a number of committees of student/faculty/staff; what we hope to learn from this review is if the current policies and procedures are working for our community,” wrote Colucci in an email to The Argus. “The second goal is ideas; we are looking for feedback and best practices from the consultants in order to continually revise our processes.”  Nila Ravi ’18 and Kate Macken ’19 were the members of the WSA who co-chaired the Title IX advisory committee.  “They’re meeting with a wide range of groups on campus — administrators, faculty, and students — and hopefully they will be able to understand the pain points of the Title IX process from all of these important perspectives,” Ravi said. “Personally, I’m hoping to advocate for increasing accessibility to the process for all students. I have been working directly with the Title IX office for two years now to improve Wesleyan’s process and this has been a personal focus for me.”  In particular, there are three established issues the review will aim to address, as mentioned in Farias’ email: the lack of clarity of resources; accessibility of the process to all, including underrepresented populations of students, faculty, and staff; and the interaction between the Title IX Office and other first responders. These key weaknesses were brought to the attention of the University as a result of the attention hard work of all on campus working to better the community through improving its policies. Farias paid tribute to the efforts of this group in the years since the external review was undertaken. “I also want to note that the Title IX Committees, composed of faculty, staff, and student representatives, have been working these issues for the past three years non-stop; and the changes made are the direct result of engagement with all aspects of the campus community as well as on and off-campus support resources,” wrote Farias. “The external assessment of Title IX we are about to undergo is the next step in our continuous improvement ethos.” “The primary reason for the consulting group coming to Wesleyan, I believe, is to make the Title IX adjudication process and Title IX related resources accessible to all students who potentially want and need it,” Ravi said. “In recent years numbers have shown that fewer students have been utilizing the Title IX process as a resource. This, coupled with the circumstances surrounding the departure of Scott Backer, and the subsequent student activism calling for reform, were big reasons why the consulting group is coming as well.”"
"Remembering the Fisk Takeover, 48 Years Later","2017-02-20","by Jake Lahut, Editor-in-Chief","Wesleyan students recreate the Fisk Takeover in 2014. c/o YouTube. Before Yale renamed a residential college that commemorated a staunch defender of slavery, before Wesleyan had an African American Studies Program, and before just about every student here was born, Black faculty, staff, and students took a stand against racism and occupied Fisk Hall on February 21, 1969. After a request for classes to be cancelled to honor a memorial service for the recently murdered Malcolm X was denied by Wesleyan’s administration, Black members of the campus community took over Fisk Hall, shutting down all regular operations in what was, at the time, the main academic hall on campus. Using the language lab, they broadcasted messages from Malcolm X’s speeches. Spectators gathered around to listen, and the takeover became a watershed moment in the University’s history. A statement outlining the mission of the takeover was announced. “In occupying Fisk Hall, we seek to dramatically expose the University’s infidelity to its professed goals and to question the sincerity of its commitment to meaningful change. We blaspheme and decry that education which is consonant with one cultural frame of reference to the exclusion of all others.” The cohort then made a series of demands, including the establishment of both housing and a cultural center for Black students, an exchange program with the University of Atlanta, African American Studies classes, and an increase in the number of Black students and faculty. After administration officials agreed to consider the demands, the takeover ended peacefully after about 12 hours. The takeover proved to be an immense success for Black students at the time, with the administration accepting the majority of the demands. The long-lasting legacy of the Fisk Takeover can be found today in buildings like Malcolm X House, which was renamed from John Wesley House, previously in honor of the Methodist founder of Wesleyan. On the 40th anniversary of the takeover, Ujamaa—the University’s Black student collective—reprinted a list of the demands with checkmarks next to accepted demands, and question marks next to unfulfilled ones, such as the University of Atlanta exchange program. In 2014, students created a video in honor of the Fisk Takeover, which is available on YouTube. Commemorations of the Fisk Takeover may take place this week, as well as potential alumni engagement with the Vanguard Class, the 13 Black students who first enrolled in the University.

"The Demise of the Democrats","2017-02-23","by Henry Spiro, Foreign Correspondent","What happened to the Democratic Party? Once the party of “hope and change,” the Democrats are incredibly fragmented and barely able to generate excitement around their message. They failed to elect someone who would be the first female President in U.S. history while she was running against an insane mad man and multi-million dollar “man of the people.” They’ve lost hold of the excitement they generated back in 2008 and become an absolute embarrassment at a time when the American people need them more than ever. As it currently stands, the Democratic Party is primarily divided into two groups: the ultra-progressive Berniecrats, and the left-of-center “pragmatic” Democrats who wish to continue with the same basic economic policies as former President Barack Obama. It’s a divide that likely had been growing since the beginning of Obama’s presidency, with the rise of “Occupy Wall Street” and other protests around the country that demanded radical changes in the United States’ economic policies after the Wall Street collapse of 2008. Now, after he departed from the White House, the Democrats are in worse shape than ever. The rift within the Democratic Party, however, became most apparent during the Democratic primaries of the 2016 presidential election, in which former independent and relatively unknown politician Bernie Sanders soared into the spotlight. He held massive, energetic rallies. He was impersonated by former “Seinfeld” producer and writer Larry David on Saturday Night Live and eventually made a cameo alongside him. He became a symbol of both American frustration and idealism, of rage at the machine and the belief that, with enough concentrated effort, it can be fixed. Bernie Sanders was an extraordinary force on the campaign trail, to the point where his name became one of the defining cultural icons of 2016. But once Bernie lost the primary and the excitement around his campaign began to fade, it became immediately clear that something was rotten with the state of the Democratic Party. How could an old socialist generate more excitement from progressives than Hillary Clinton, a candidate to be the first female President? How could the party of the working class alienate them so? How could a major party in America be openly advocating socialism when the term “liberal” was once taboo? It is now clear that the Democratic Party is deeply divided. Many were outraged at the “neoliberal” policies that they had been carrying out for years. From Bill Clinton to Obama and, if she had won, Hillary, Democrats had ignored the working classes and had far too much support for harmful trade deals and loose regulations. Furthermore, Obama had failed to live up to his much-hyped campaign promises, failing to end conflicts in the Middle East and not delivering on enough of the excitement and progress that his campaign had promised. On the most divisive and heated issues of American politics, from Occupy to Black Lives Matter, Obama responded with passivity, not willing to confront the issues head on. This left the Democrats in a fragile state, unable to meet the demands of the American people. The United States did not suddenly evolve into the liberal utopia many had expected Obama could create, leaving some Democrats bitter and spiteful. Now, with an election for DNC Chairman taking place this Sunday, the entire future of the Democratic Party is up for grabs. There are 10 candidates up for the job, but only two have a big enough national profile to have a legitimate chance of winning. Each is symbolic of the different sides of the Democratic divide. Do the Democrats go for the energetic, Bernie-esque progressive in the form of Keith Ellison? Or do they stick to Obama’s status quo in the form of his former Secretary of Labor Tom Perez? Either choice has obvious pros and cons. Perez would continue to push for Obama-era policies, which are more practical than anything a Berniecrat would push and could genuinely help the economy. The downside of continuing with Obama’s policies is that they represent more of the same: some tax raises, obnoxious and uncompromising Republican pushback, etc. More importantly than the details of his actual policies, however, is that this sameness will limit the appeal of both Perez and the Democratic Party as a whole. If this election (and, in its own way, the 2008 election of Barack Obama) has proven anything, it’s that people hate the status quo. Everyone wants something to change; the system is broken; revolution is necessary; “Make America Great Again.” His policies may or may not work in practice, but his status as “more of the same” makes him a totally unexciting and uninspiring choice. Ellison, on the other hand, is more of a Sanders surrogate, representing the progressive, far-left wing of the Democratic Party. Ellison is the far more exciting choice for the Democrats. He represents a revolutionary change in the status quo along the lines of everyone’s favorite grandpa (Sanders, obviously). He could energize the base of Democratic supporters in a way that Hillary never could and that Obama only could back in 2008. Based on voting data, a more progressive, further left-wing Democratic Party is seemingly what this country wants. Ellison is the first Muslim to be elected to U.S. Congress, making him the perfect symbol of Trump opposition. His early support of Sanders’ campaign will help gain the support of young voters disillusioned by the centrist wing of the party. He could dust off the cobwebs of the aging Democratic Party and encourage political activism for left-wing causes in a way that America needs right now. Because now, perhaps more than ever, America needs civic engagement in its political system. In case you haven’t been paying attention, the President of the United States is a both a fearmongerer and an idiot, incapable of articulating sentences correctly while having mastered the art of scapegoating everyone’s problems on Mexico and Muslims. Not only that, but every major move he makes, from bashing and discrediting the media to his worrying relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggests he’s an autocrat waiting to seize power. The moment in history we are living through is, as best said by military historian Eliot A. Cohen, “…one of those clarifying moments in American history….” It is a time in which the foundations of our democracy are threatened by an unstable, power-hungry leader with no regard for the Constitution or acknowledgment of any restraints on his power. Furthermore, he ran on the Republican Party ticket and energized their base voters in a way that hasn’t been seen in years. In doing so, he’s given the Republicans every reason to support him: If they don’t, they’ll lose popularity and be unable to pass their agenda. When Speaker of the House Paul Ryan criticized Trump for his leaked tape with Billy Bush, Ryan’s popularity among Republicans dropped by 28 points in just over a week. Other prominent Republicans seem to be more interested in passing their agenda and holding onto their political careers than, say, having basic principles and a moral backbone. So, as former G.W. Bush speechwriter David Frum has argued, Trump and his power grabs are unlikely to be opposed by Republicans. America now finds itself in a perilous place, facing an ironic plot twist: The party of big government is now the only major check on government power. Which is why their internal divides must be healed and they must unify regardless of who becomes Chairman this weekend. Ultimately, the Democrats must do what the Republicans can do best: unify around an agenda, whatever it may be. The major divides within the left, if unhealed, could spell doom for not only the future of the Democratic Party, but of a free democracy in America. The Democratic Party must save America from itself. Hopefully they can save themselves first. Spiro is a member of the Class of 2019."
"Beyond 2020: President Roth’s Vision for the Next Decade","2017-03-06","by Emmy Hughes, Erin Hussey, Assistant News Editors","President Michael Roth ’78, whose contract as University president has just been extended until 2023, recently published a post on his blog titled “Beyond 2020: Strategies for Wesleyan” that looks toward the future of the University. The Argus has obtained a longer draft of the plan that President Roth has shared with trustees, which addresses the post-2020 years, including Roth’s strategy for resource allocation on areas including education and economic sustainability.  The premise for this update is the impending end of the “Wesleyan 2020” framework, which addresses similar issues. The overarching aim of “Wesleyan 2020,” as addressed in the mission statement, essentially revolves around ensuring that students, and by extension the University itself, excel in a variety of ways.  The administration considers “Wesleyan 2020” a success in many ways. After witnessing a drop in admissions in 2014 and 2015, the University received over 12,000 applications in 2016, lowering the admissions rate to 17.7 percent: a 5 percent drop since 2015 and an overall 3 percent drop since the adoption of “Wesleyan 2020.” Additionally, the University witnessed a 2 percent increase in first-generation students, a 5 percent increase in non-native English speakers, and a significant drop in students from New England.  In addition, “Wesleyan 2020” specifically addresses the school’s ranking, both in describing the reason behind the school’s ranks and what the University intends to do to improve it. “While Wesleyan was the wealthiest school in relation to the number of students in the late 1960s and early 1970s, today the University does not have the ability to sustain the levels of spending per student that one finds at some of our peer institutions,” reads the “Competition and Prestige” section of the framework. “This has an immediate negative impact on the rankings. With endowment increasingly taken as a way of measuring educational strength, Wesleyan has seen its standing erode.” Roth’s “Beyond 2020” document addresses additional goals, including expansions on the original plans of the 2020 framework. Roth notes that as 2020 rapidly approaches, it is important to develop the framework for the post-2020 decade. He does this by establishing three main areas of development—“Academic Core,” “Enhance Recognition,” and “Sustainable Economic Model and Campus Planning”—under the initiative’s overarching goals to “energize Wesleyan’s distinctive educational experience… enhance recognition of Wesleyan as an extraordinary institution… [and] work within a sustainable economic model while retaining core values.”  In terms of academics, Roth intends to both expand upon the 2020 framework, as well as ensure that students, in the quintessential liberal arts fashion, leave the University having come in contact with a diverse array of political and intellectual thought and the skills to succeed in the world at large. “We must continue to find ways to ensure that a Wesleyan education remains relevant decades beyond graduation,” the document reads. “This will mean ‘breaking the bubble’ by encouraging intellectual/political diversity, creating more internship opportunities and linking them back to a student’s educational goals, making the residential experience a more integrated part of a student’s learning, and teaching the value of sustainability across a variety of fields and ways of life.” Roth also highlighted the previous academic and educational successes established by the 2020 framework. “We have made significant progress in linking community engagement and sustainability to the academic program (under the Allbritton Center); developing internship opportunities (under the Gordon Career Center); and refining co-curricular learning goals (under Student Affairs),” he wrote. “The Equity Task Force last year recommended that we develop plans for a Resource Center, and we will do so in the coming year as part of an ongoing institution-wide effort to build greater equity and inclusion.” Additionally, Roth intends to build on the strength of the University’s faculty. He describes four tangible skills he hopes students will develop in coming years, via strengthening University staff. These include “interacting with objects and information,” which emphasizes building the arts and design; “expressing and describing,” which focuses on writing; “analyzing quantitative and digital data,” which targets coding and computer science; and “engaging with difference and building community,” which stresses diversity in terms of student body, staff, and curriculum. As far as enhancing recognition, Roth hopes to not only build the applicant pool, but to increase the notability of the University’s pragmatic approach to liberal education as well. “Investing in the work of our students (and alumni) so as to allow them to have a deeper impact across a variety of fields enhances recognition of the power of a Wesleyan education,” the brief explains. “We add value to everyone’s diploma and increase the prestige of the University by supporting the ongoing projects of our faculty, advanced students and alumni. We embrace our academic core by showing its relevance beyond academia.” One way Roth suggests that the University can make itself relevant to those who have never been on campus is through the partnership with Coursera, a site that has offered online Wesleyan classes to more than 1.6 million students thus far. “[These online classes can raise] the profile of liberal education in… parts of this country underserved by educational institutions, and also parts of the world (like China and India) where economic development has allowed many more people to pursue higher education,” the section concludes. The final piece of the “Beyond 2020” document addresses the economic future of the University. Previous frameworks, including “Wesleyan 2020,” cite Victor Butterfield’s era as president and the 1960s-70s as the leading examples of University wealth and academic prosperity. Roth hopes for similar success in his tenure as president of the University. “College affordability is one of the defining educational issues of our time, and it must be factored into our financial planning,” the document reads. “Fortunately, the successful THIS IS WHY campaign makes it possible to increase our financial aid budget.” Roth states that financial aid will be a major point of focus in “Beyond 2020,” including prioritizing middle-class affordability and expanding the number of students on full scholarships, which is currently at 10 percent. “We can address both of these issues by adding dollars to the financial aid budget to increase the discount rate,” Roth writes. “We will add (in addition to any normal increase to the financial aid budget) $2.5 million over the next four years to financial aid, and then, with further fundraising, add another $2.5 million in the following four-year cycle.” In addition to financial aid, Roth addressed the future of University fundraising. “Our current plan is to raise $40 million annually, of which $10-11 million goes to the Wesleyan Fund (meaning the dollars are spent annually). Although the positive effects of THIS IS WHY are just kicking in, we are already thinking about the next fundraising campaign, and three areas of focus have emerged: facilities; financial aid and internships; innovative academic positions and programs,” the report says. Roth concludes the brief by highlighting the University’s continued commitment to inclusion and opportunity for all students. “In a time of turbulence and worry, Wesleyan continues to attract and educate ‘fearless optimists,’” Roth writes. “Our job is to meet those needs by building the very best Wesleyan we can imagine, true to its traditions and confidently facing the future.”"
"Middlesex Hospital Named “Leader in LGBTQ Healthcare Equality”","2017-04-06","by William Halliday, Photo Editor","On March 29, the Human Rights Campaign Foundation (HRC Foundation) released its tenth annual Healthcare Equality Index (HEI), recognizing Middlesex Hospital as one of 303 “Leaders in LGBTQ Healthcare Equality.” Middlesex Hospital is the only general, acute hospital in Connecticut to receive this recognition. The other facilities in Connecticut that received this distinction were the Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut and the VA Connecticut Healthcare System.  In a press release issued on March 29, the hospital commented on its recognition by the HEI. “At Middlesex Hospital, we are committed to helping everyone who walks through our doors, and we do this by putting the needs of our patients at the center of everything we do,” said Hospital CEO Vincent G. Capece, Jr. “Earning the designation of being a leader in LGBTQ health care equality is a natural byproduct of putting our beliefs into action.” To achieve this distinction, Middlesex Hospital received the maximum score in each of the HRC Foundation’s four policy categories: Non-Discrimination and Staff Training, Patient Services and Support, Employee Benefits and Policies, and Patient and Community Engagement. In addition to the 590 facilities that participated in the survey, the HRC Foundation also surveyed 900 non-participating hospitals. The policies in place at these non-participating facilities were in stark contrast to the policies at participating hospitals: only 61 percent have non-discrimination policies that include gender identity and sexual orientation and only 52 percent have LGBTQ-inclusive employment non-discrimination policies. According to the report, the three states with the highest numbers of “Leaders of LGBTQ Healthcare Equality” in 2017 were California (77), New York (49), and North Carolina (22). North Carolina’s success in the HEI is surprising in light of House Bill 2, which was passed in 2016 and eliminated all existing municipal non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ individuals and banned any future protections. “Hospitals and healthcare systems in North Carolina fought back. Many reassured their employees of their commitment to LGBTQ diversity and inclusion, and some spoke out publicly against HB2…Several hospitals in North Carolina made a commitment to LGBTQ inclusion by participating in the HEI for the first time, and many of them achieved the Leader in LGBTQ Healthcare Equality designation. This year, 28 hospitals in North Carolina participated in the HEI, and 22 of them earned the Leader designation,” the report said. The report includes an outline of the HEI’s scoring criteria. Facilities gained points as they met the criteria contained in each of the four policy categories. A fifth category titled Responsible Citizenship subtracted points for activities that undermine LGBTQ healthcare equality. The 80-page report includes an in-depth explanation of the HRC Foundation’s findings, recommends further improvements to LGBTQ healthcare, and reiterates the importance of providing inclusive care. An opening letter penned by HRC Foundation President Chad Griffin expresses the HEI’s importance in improving healthcare equality.  “The 2017 HEI reminds us again that though we have made tremendous gains over the past decade, there is still much more work left for us to do,” he said. “With some of our biggest battles still ahead of us, it is crucial that institutions continue to demonstrate that the march toward full equality is not slowing down. The 590 participants in this year’s HEI continue this march in partnership with the LGBTQ community. For the past decade, the HEI has been the roadmap to closing the gap in ensuring equal care to LGBTQ patients and their families, and we urge every healthcare facility to join us in this continuing effort to provide inclusive care to all.” Griffin also applauds the progress that occurred in 2017. “As this overview of the HEI 2017 indicates, diverse healthcare facilities across the U.S. are making tremendous strides toward LGBTQ patient-centered care. In unprecedented numbers, they are changing key policies, implementing best practices and training their staff. We heartily applaud all the facilities that participate in the HEI and make a commitment to LGBTQ patient-centered care.”"
"University to Move Forward With Equity and Inclusion Resource Center","2017-04-06","by Jenny Davis, Executive Editor","c/o Wesleyan University The University has set official plans in motion to address the first of three Equity Task Force recommendations: constructing a resource center devoted to increasing equity and inclusion. The proposal for the Center was submitted in early March, and University President Michael Roth ’78 has authorized a search for a director for the Center. The proposal for the Center grows out of the #IsThisWhy campaign and the subsequent Task Force recommendations, which suggested first that the administration “develop a Center with an intellectually grounded mission in social justice and a focus on intercultural development and literacy.” (The other two recommendations are to address discrimination and marginalization in the faculty, staff, and curricula, as well as to implement a committee to “coordinate, communicate and support change in these areas.”) Designed by the Equity and Inclusion Steering Committee (EISC), the proposal for the Center includes specific plans for supporting students in four broad categories: students of color, those who are queer and transgender, those who are low income and/or first generation, and those who are female-identifying. “Although Wesleyan has made significant progress towards ameliorating marginalization, racism, queerphobia, transphobia, and xenophobia, more remains to be done,” reads the proposal’s introduction. “The Center is aligned with the mission of Wesleyan University, the Board of Trustees Statement on Equity and Inclusion, and the Office for Equity and Inclusion. Together, we assert a commitment to creating and sustaining a culture of diversity, egalitarianism, and altruism in all aspects of campus life.” The EISC, which was assembled in the fall of 2016, consists of President of the Wesleyan Student Assembly (WSA) Rebecca Hutman ’17; Evelysse Vargas ’17; Ainsley Eakins ’18; Vice President for Equity and Inclusion and Title IX Officer Antonio Farias; Irma González, Chair of the Campus Affairs Committee of the Board of Trustees; and Janice Naegele, Professor of Biology and Vice Chair of the Faculty. Its work was also supported by Mike Whaley, Vice President for Student Affairs, as well as a Student Advisory Board that included Caroline Liu ’18, Justina Yam ’19, Justin Ratkovic ’20, Hanh Pham ’19, and Keishan Christophe ’19. Vargas noted that the four overarching groups that the Center aims to support come from pre-existing categories and structures devoted to advocating for those identity groups, but that the groups are not all-encompassing—and nor, she believes, should they be. “It isn’t exhaustive,” she said. “We might be talking about gender differently in ten years, sexuality, race. We don’t really know where this is going to go. We have ideas, but it’s important to keep a kind of openness for different groups to say, ‘Hey, can this be our resource center too?’” Hutman spoke to the importance of including a wide range of student voices in the proposal-writing process. “There was an interest in having student input because a lot of people recognized that this center grew out of student demands and student protests, and we wanted the spirit of those movements to help shape the process itself,” she said. Whaley explained the choice to tackle the Center before the other two Task Force recommendations. “I know one of the other recommendations was a critique of the training that happens on an ongoing basis for different segments of our community, including faculty and staff,” he said. “And I think that what you see in the proposal is the idea that the Center would serve as not really a hub for all of that, because there are different avenues and mechanisms for the training to happen, but in some ways that there’s coordination and the center serves as a catalyst for that happening.” The proposal for the Center includes a detailed explanation of the programming that will occur there, including convening workshops for students, faculty, and staff to discuss social phenomena and themes such as transphobia and microaggressions at Wesleyan; bringing speakers to campus; and brainstorming ways in which student groups can “translate their lived experiences into innovative and impactful work and action.” The Center will occupy the building at 167 High Street, currently the Shapiro Creative Writing Center, which will relocate. Whaley explained why he believes that central location to be an effective choice. “Having it on the periphery seems antithetical, to me, to what it’s supposed to be about,” he said. “And so when I heard that the Shapiro Creative Writing Center would be moving, I was thinking, ‘Wow, that could be a really interesting space.’” Eakins, who was an integral member of 2015’s #IsThisWhy? movement, reflected that writing the proposal for a Center achievable in the short term required compromise. “I had a lot of dreams for it,” she said. “And just in the process of us outlining the bronze, silver, gold models, I wanted the gold, and I thought the gold should have already been there fifteen years ago. So I guess I thought it would be a huge space, and it would automatically become somewhere low-income students could go to get the groceries that they need, or get grants for the things that they aren’t able to get, or that students of color can make a complaint against some racist practice, and it would be dealt with. I thought it would be implemented so easily, and I was very naïve in thinking that way.” Even so, Eakins believes that the proposal will yield a Center poised to thrive. She pointed to one particular possibility: the easy and immediate availability of resources such as explanatory pamphlets and zines. “There are so many student groups that make zines that talk about these issues and explain them so well, but you have to go to a specific person and go try to get it, make copies, or you have to go to an event,” Eakins said. “When I imagine the Center, I imagine there being pamphlets all around that everyone would have access to. If you have questions, you don’t even have to Google it—you can just go in and ask some of the interns that will be housed there. That’s essential in the long run: not just providing resources to the most marginalized, but making sure the privileged can do that too.” Hutman explained that another key component of the Center’s work will be its communication with academic departments. “We’ll have a faculty fellow in the center who will work with different academic departments to infuse conversations about issues of social injustice and marginalization into the classrooms for professors and students who might not feel comfortable having those conversations in other cases,” she said. Farias noted what he sees as an important challenge for the realization of the Center. “Sustaining the initial energy around the Center and expecting that there will be missteps and less than optimal events or engagements as a normal part of launching a new entity on campus will be the biggest challenge,” he said. “I have the highest regard for the intellect, passion, and emotional core of the students, staff, and faculty that will serve and be served by this Center, and expect we’ll find creative solutions to complex and messy problems—which in the end is the highest value diversity brings to us—the ability to bring difference into a room without homogenizing it and solving complex problems that make us more inclusive in a world that is more equitable than how we found it.” González stressed that the proposal, while a useful blueprint, is far from a fully realized vision for the Center. “We assume the center will grow and evolve and be responsive to what students, faculty, and staff need on campus,” she said. “We’ve got something on the table, and it’s moving forward at an even faster pace than the Equity Taskforce hoped it would. It’s only going to be as good as we continue to make it be.” Hutman agreed. “[Vargas] and I are graduating,” she said. “[Eakins] is going to be here for one more year. It’s really important that the concept of the center is internalized by the people who will really be here to see it through, and the specific programs that come from them.”"
"Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro Calls Students to Action","2017-04-06","by Emmy Hughes, Assistant News Editor","In response to the election of Donald Trump as the 45th U.S. president, the Wesleyan Democrats (WesDems) are hosting a succession of political speakers in a series called “Resistance in the Age of Trump.” This series aims to demonstrate the steps current Democrats in office are taking to oppose the Trump administration, in addition to informing the University and Middletown communities of actions they too can take. On April 1, the series opened with Connecticut Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro as its first speaker, addressing a full audience in the University’s Public Affairs Center. After an introduction from state representative and Wesleyan alumnus Matt Lesser ’10 and WesDems president Simon Korn ’17, Rosa DeLauro took to the podium—though over the course of the talk she spent little time behind it, preferring instead to walk around the floor. She opened the talk with a call to action, noting the necessity for persistent efforts on the part of the nation’s public. “There’s such a need for your drive and your energy right now,” DeLauro said. “The way I characterize it, it’s really dangerous times, perilous times. So your engagement and involvement…is really critically important. Moving on to note the importance of paying attention to the multifaceted dimensions of certain issues, DeLauro entreated students to stay informed in order to ensure their voices are heard. “It’s important to understand the nuances of the various debates that are occurring in the Congress, the fine points of those debates,” DeLauro said. “To the extent that you find an area that you’re particularly interested in, follow that, because it’s not always what you read in the paper or what you hear on the news, et cetera. It’s much more granular than that in terms of what the outcomes are and can be in these events. As I said, these are a difficult few months. We are in uncharted waters.” DeLauro then moved into a discussion about the Affordable Care Act, explaining the dynamics surrounding the Trump Administration’s attempt, and subsequent failure, to repeal it. She brought up multiple perspectives on the issue, noting first the unity of the Democratic National Party in regard to preserving the Affordable Care Act, and the important role the public paid in keeping the bill afloat. “I believe that the reason why that bill was pulled, and they had such a failure, was because of the American people,” she said. “The marches, the phone calls, the letters, the communication. The overwhelming communication, to people, not just in their offices in Washington, but in their district offices. It was overwhelming.” DeLauro transitioned into a criticism of a number of people Trump chose to put into office, namely Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Scott Pruit. “Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education,” DeLauro said. “Wow. I don’t know what to say…She does not believe in public education… And talk about separation of church and state, she has a major tie with religious institutions, and I went through 16 years of Catholic education, but this is not public education, which is 90 percent of our kids. She does not believe in making sure that they are provided for. So we will do the same thing; I’m watching the administration as closely as I can.” Likewise, DeLauro noted the negative consequences of the Trump administration’s decision to place Scott Pruitt as the administrator of the EPA. DeLauro mentioned that Pruitt had sued the EPA over a dozen times, and that not only does he not believe climate change is caused by humans, but he also rescinded executive orders from the Obama administration that protected the environment and curbed emissions. “They’ve got the wrong priorities,” she said. “We’ve got to protect scientists and researchers.” After finishing her talk with another call to action, in which she stressed the necessity of political involvement, DeLauro took questions from the audience. Théo Storella ’20 posed a question concerning hope for moving forward efforts on prominent issues under this administration. “Resistance is really good to keep things from moving backwards, and that’s great, but for these issues like healthcare and the environment and stuff like that, we not only need to keep ourselves from moving back, we’ve got to go forward,” he said. “So if we don’t have the house of representatives, would you say there’s kind of a degree of hopelessness in that?” DeLauro replied by explaining the necessity of first fighting Republicans on their efforts to dismantle both healthcare and environmental laws, and then from there, Democrats furthering efforts in both. She explained the importance of the 2018 elections in getting things turned around, as well as mentioned the importance of ensuring the Affordable Care Act was not repealed. She noted that no matter what, one should not lose hope. “I never talk about hopelessness, I got to tell you that, I never go there,” she said. “I can’t go there.” Korn and board member Alexandra Prendergast ’20 both thought it to be a successful and extremely relevant event. “This is one of the components of our plan to become a focal point for the resistance against the Trump administration on campus,” Korn explained. “It’s about asking people who have experiences with resisting presidential administrations, the Trump administration specifically, [and] making a difference in the face of long odds, or making a difference in the face of any kind of odds. How we, as Wesleyan students, who live in a liberal district, who by and large come from liberal districts, can make a difference.” Prendergast shared in Korn’s sentiment as to the importance of bringing speakers to the University. “This year, we’re seeing a lot more political activism nationwide than we have in many, many years, and so I think it’s extremely important as Wesleyan democrats that we engage with the community here on campus and elsewhere to try and get people active and involved in politics,” she said. Despite the heavy topic, DeLauro’s speech and Q&A session was ultimately hopeful. “People cannot get tired of engaging on these issues,” she said. “You’ve got to overwhelm the system.”"
"WesCeleb: Casey Smith ‘17","2017-04-13","by Sonya Sternlieb, Contributing Writer","Caroline Kravitz, Staff Photographer Casey Smith ’17 is known for her work as co-founder of the Wesleyan Refugee Project (WRP), which spreads awareness about refugee issues and works with refugee aid organizations to help provide funding, tutoring, and paperwork assistance for those settling into the United States, most notably in the Hartford-New Haven metro area. Smith sat down with The Argus to discuss her work with WRP, her experience as an activist at Wes, and her freshman-year acting debut.   The Wesleyan Argus: A lot of people on campus know you in the context of your WRP work. What’s something folks might not know about you? Casey Smith: I think one thing that people don’t know is that I’m from North Carolina. I’m from total basketball territory, from a college town. I have a lot of friends from New York and California and the places where Wesleyan people are commonly from, and I don’t have a southern accent, so I feel like people don’t really know I’m from the south. But I do feel this inherent connection to Southerners. Another thing people might not know is that I actually came to Wesleyan because it has such an awesome Dance department—I wanted to major in dance. I sort of wanted to be more artistic. I had this whole other vision for how I’d spend my Wesleyan experience. And then I got interested in law and policy and international affairs. I think I’ve gotten—the positive term would be more focused, the negative would be more type-A—just a little more of a perfectionist, because everyone here works so hard and is so motivated, and has pushed me to be more focused. A: Any other little-known artistic endeavors? CS: I starred in a film thesis my freshman year. I had never acted before, and I’ve never acted since. A: What thesis? CS: It was Amanda Sonnenschein’s [’14]. I was playing like, a girl whose boyfriend murders someone, so that was really fun. I loved doing that, even though I haven’t been involved in film since then. A: Is the footage anywhere? CS: Probably, but I’m not going to comment on that. A: On a more serious note, how did you get involved with refugee issues? CS: I’m from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where there’s a pretty sizeable population of Karen-Burmese refugees. My sophomore year of high school I had a friend involved with tutoring refugees. We got involved with the community, and we wound up bringing in more tutors and starting a summer camp. It was kind of my first international experience, my first time meeting and learning what a refugee was and learning about global conflicts and issues. A: How has being at Wes affected how you think about these issues? CS: My sophomore year I was interning for Integrated Refugee Immigrant Services in New Haven. People on campus seemed like they’d be interested in getting involved, and that’s kind of what we started WRP out of, just wanting to bring more people to these agencies, wanting to build this relationship between Wesleyan and IRIS, between Wesleyan and the New Haven refugee community. People at Wes have been really motivated to get involved in this type of work, and I think that’s driven my efforts at well. I think Wesleyan’s really unique in that everyone wants to get involved in social entrepreneurship or community engagement. There’s a ton of resources at Wesleyan for that sort of initiative, and so I definitely feel like it’s a Wesleyan-specific sort of interest. People on this campus have so many really interesting, creative talents that they’re always looking to bring to social impact work. We always get people reaching out volunteering to teach a yoga class, or host a benefit concert—they want to use their skills to raise funds or do something that would make an impact. So I do feel like that’s a Wesleyan-specific thing, that creative mindset behind a lot of those initiatives. A: What advice would you give to students interested in getting involved in this type of activism? CS: I think they should try and build as many relationships as possible with different organizations and groups, and even faculty on campus, and to try and think broadly about how to use the resources on this campus to do something productive. There are so many people here who want to get involved in things, who bring a lot of personal or even professional experiences to working on advocacy or organizing, so just making the most of those resources, and talking to as many people as possible, would be my biggest piece of advice. A: I remember hearing you speak about the issues with a lot of sympathetic media narratives about refugees—could you talk a bit about that? CS: It’s something that I think about a lot with WRP—how do we avoid sharing content on Facebook or talking about refugee issues in a way that uses these tropes. A lot of the time, film or media about refugee crises will give this one narrative, where Syrian refugees are victimized in these different ways and they’ll show these very sad images of people. I see why they’re doing that—they’re trying to raise awareness, and a lot of NGOs will do that to raise funds, but a lot of these images only show the worst thing that ever happened to a person, and I think that’s kind of problematic just because often people don’t get to tell their own stories or determine how they will be represented. One thing I’m always thinking about when looking at documentaries or media stories is, are they [the filmmakers or reporters] coming in with a narrative already in mind about who this person is, or is the subject able to tell their story the way they want to. I’m not sure if there is a right way to approach these very sensitive issues, but that’s something I’m always critical of. A: You’re a very busy person—what do you do in your free time? CS: I really like bands and music from North Carolina—my mother is really into local bands and music—so when I’m home I really like to go see local music with her. I’m taking Ebony Singers and that’s been really fun—not something I’m good at but really fun. A: WesFest is upon us—do you have any advice for incoming frosh? CS: Try and do a few activities the best you can, and not like a hundred different things. At first, I think it can be useful to get involved in a bunch of different activities, but over time narrowing in on the things you’re really invested in can be much more rewarding, and I think you can get more out of that kind of experience. A: If pre-frosh abound, graduation must be nigh. Have your post-college plans been influenced by recent events, and might we see a resurgence of your artsy side? CS: I’m working for a legal organization, so I doubt that my artistic side will return… I had always planning on doing some sort of fellowship abroad, and I ended up deciding not to do that. Looking at the American political system, I feel like there’s a lot of work to be done in the realm of refugee and immigration law. The job I accepted is working on impact litigation for this organization called the International Refugee Assistance Project, which represents refugees. The work I’ll be involved with directly ensues from recent policies, and that was something I felt very invested in doing, given recent events."
